Rodney Sacks: Thanks, Tom. Trends in our Nielsen-measured categories have been accelerating since early 2025. Consumer purchases in our non-Nielsen-measured categories are following the same trend. Growth opportunities in household penetration and per capita consumption, along with consumers’ growing need for energy, are positive trends for the category. In the United States, the energy category, according to Nielsen, for the recently reported 13 weeks through April 26, 2025, grew at 10% versus the same period last year. In EMEA, the energy drink category, according to Nielsen, for our tracked markets for the recently reported 13-week period, which differs from country to country, grew at approximately 13.7% versus the same period last year on an FX-neutral basis. In APAC, the energy drink category, according to Nielsen and INTAGE, for the recently reported 13-week period, which differs from country-to-country, grew at approximately 13.6% versus the same period last year, also on an FX-neutral basis. In LatAm, the energy drink category, according to Nielsen, for our tracked markets for the recently reported 13-week period, which differs from country-to-country, grew at approximately 15.7% versus the same period last year on an FX-neutral basis. This does not include Argentina and Chile. Net sales for the 2025 first quarter were negatively impacted by bottler/distributor ordering patents, specifically in the United States and EMEA. Adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased sales in the Alcohol Brand segment, adverse weather, one less selling day in the 2025 first quarter, as well as uncertain economic conditions. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales for the 2025 first quarter of $57.3 million. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis, net sales for the 2025 first quarter increased 0.7% or 1.9% excluding the Alcohol segment. Reported net sales were $1.85 billion in the 2025 first quarter or 2.3% lower than net sales of $1.9 billion in the comparable 2024 first quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2025 first quarter was 56.5%, compared with 54.1% in the 2024 first quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2025 first quarter was primarily the result of pricing actions, as well as supply chain optimization in the quarter. Operating expenses for the 2025 first quarter were $478.2 million, compared with $485.1 million in the 2024 first quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2025 first quarter were 25.8%, compared with 25.5% in the 2024 first quarter. Distribution and warehouse expenses for the 2025 first quarter were $77.6 million or 4.2% of net sales, compared with $94.4 million or 5% of net sales in the 2024 first quarter. Operating income for the 2025 first quarter increased 5.1% to $569.7 million from $542 million in the 2024 comparative quarter. Operating income for the 2025 first quarter, exclusive of the Alcohol Brand segment, increased 7.9% to $591.2 million from $548 million in the 2024 first quarter. The effective tax rate for the 2025 first quarter was 23.4%, compared with 23.5% in the 2024 first quarter. Net income in the 2025 first quarter was $443 million as, compared to $442 million in the 2024 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2025 first quarter increased 7.4% to $0.45 from $0.42 in the first quarter of 2024. Diluted earnings per share for the 2025 first quarter, exclusive of the Alcohol Brand segment, increased 10.2% to $0.47 from $0.42 in the first quarter of 2024. During the first quarter of 2025, the impact of tariffs on our operating results was immaterial. In general, while our concentrates are manufactured both in the U.S. and Ireland at the present time, production of our finished products takes place locally in our respective markets. The tariff landscape is complicated and dynamic. We import some raw materials into the United States, export certain raw materials for local markets, and export limited quantities of finished products. We do not believe, based on our business model, that the current tariffs will have a material impact on the company’s operating results. We will recognize tariffs on aluminum through the higher Midwest premium and are reviewing mitigation strategies across the business. For instance, AAF, our flavor and concentrate subsidiary, is planning to establish a facility in Brazil, which should be operational later in 2026. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks ended April 26, 2025, for all outlets combined, excluding convenience and gas, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 13.8% versus the same period a year ago. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks ended April 26, 2025, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 10% versus the same period a year ago.

According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended April 26, 2025, the company’s market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, decreased from 37.1% to 36.4%, including Bang. Monster’s share decreased from 29.2% to 29%. Reign’s share decreased 0.4 of a share point to 2.6%. NOS’ share decreased 0.1 of a share point to 2.5%.

According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended April 26, 2025, sales in dollars of the coffee + energy drink category, which includes our Java Monster and Killer Brew lines in the convenience and gas channel, decreased 1.2% over the same period the previous year. Sales of Java Monster including Killer Brew were 4.4% higher in the same period versus the previous year. Sales of Starbucks Energy Coffee were 11.7% lower. Monster Coffee’s share of the coffee + energy drink category for the four weeks ended April 26, 2025, was 62.1%, up 3.4 points, while Starbucks Energy Coffee’s share was 36.6%, down 4.4 points. According to Nielsen, in all major channels in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended March 22, 2025, the energy drink category increased 9.4% in dollars. Sales of the company’s energy drink brands increased 11.4% versus a year ago. The market share of the company’s energy drink brands increased 0.7 of a point to 40.9%. Monster’s sales increased 8.5% and its market share decreased 0.3 of a share point to 36.1%. NOS’ sales increased 12.4% and its market share increased 0.1 of a point to 1.2%. Full Throttle’s sales increased 6.2% and its market share remained at 0.5 of a percent. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category increased 9% for the month of March 2025. Monster’s sales increased 15.3%. Monster’s market share in value increased 1.7 points to 31.3% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Predator increased 22.2% and its market share increased 0.7 of a share point to 6.4%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced, positively and or negatively, by sales in the OXXO convenience chain which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Brazil, the energy drink category increased 33.7% for the month of March 2025. Monster’s sales increased 26.5%. Monster’s market share in value decreased 2.6 points to 45.2% compared to March 2024. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Chile, the energy drink category increased 1.6% for the month of March 2025. Monster’s sales decreased 3.5%. Monster’s market share in value decreased 2.2 points to 40.7% compared to March 2024. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Argentina, in March 2025, Monster’s market share in value decreased 6.5 points to 52% compared to March 2024. We are the market share leader in Brazil, Chile and Argentina. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending March 30, 2025, Monster’s retail market share in value, as compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 16.2% to 18% in Belgium, from 22.6% to 24.4% in the Czech Republic, from 26.9% to 27.7% in Denmark, from 32.1% to 33.2% in Great Britain, from 15.8% to 18.1% in Germany, from 6.6% to 11.1% in The Netherlands, from 32.8% to 36.9% in Norway, from 18.6% to 21.3% in Poland, and from 30.2% to 33.4% in the Republic of Ireland.

We are pleased that in the 2025 first quarter, Monster gained market share in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Great Britain, Germany, Greece, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland and the Republic of Ireland. According to Cercana, for all outlets combined in Australia, the energy drink category increased 8.1% for the four weeks ending April 20, 2025. Monster’s sales increased 22.2%.

We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or four-week periods may often be materially influenced, positively and or negatively, by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. Net sales to customers outside the United States on a foreign currency-adjusted basis increased 6.2% to $790.5 million in the 2025 first quarter. Reported net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $733.2 million, 35.9% of total net sales in the 2025 first quarter, compared to $744.1 million, or 39.2% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2024. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $57.3 million in the 2025 first quarter. In EMEA, net sales for the 2025 first quarter decreased by 2.6% in dollars, but increased 2.1% on a currency-neutral basis over the same period in 2024.

We remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for the Monster brand in China, and are excited about Predator, which is being rolled out to additional markets in China. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 21.6% in dollars and increased 28.8% on a currency-neutral basis. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the 2025 first quarter decreased 3.1% in dollars, but increased 14.4% on a currency-neutral basis over the same period in 2024. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 44.6% for the 2025 first quarter versus 42.8% in the 2024 first quarter.

Net sales in Argentina increased 20.7% in dollars and increased 65.7% on a currency-neutral basis in the 2025 first quarter. Monster Brewing continued to face challenges in the first quarter. We remain focused on optimizing our personnel and facilities to support the current demand for our Monster Brewing portfolio and innovation pipeline. Net sales for the Alcohol Brand segment were $34.7 million in the 2025 first quarter, a decrease of approximately $21.4 million or 38.1% lower than the 2024 comparable quarter, largely as a result of the launch of Nasty Beast Hard Tea in the first quarter of 2024. As planned, Michi, our newest flavoured beer innovation, is being shipped to distributors and retailers and is in the process of a national launch in two 24-ounce flavors, Michi Lime Chelada and Michi Tomato Michelada. We are planning to launch the Beast in certain international markets, subject to regulatory approvals. We are planning for further innovation in Monster Brewing in the coming months. In the United States, in January, we launched Reign Storm Tropical, Bang Sour Ropes and Monster Ultra Blue Hawaiian at retail. In February, we launched Juice Monster Viking Berry, Killer Brew Mean Bean, Killer Brew Loca Moca and Reign Turtle Body Fuel White Haze. In March, we launched Bang Any Means Orange. In Canada, during the first quarter of 2025, we launched Monster Energy Ultra Fantasy Ruby Red, Monster Rio Punch, Java Monster Irish Crème, Reign Turtle Body Fuel Sour Gummy Worm, Monster Reserve Peaches N Crème, Monster Rehab Green Tea, Reign Storm Guava Strawberry and Citrus Zest and Bang Cotton Candy. In Latin America, during the first quarter of 2025, we launched a series of innovations within the Ultra family. In January, we launched Ultra Peachy Keen in Chile. This was followed in March by the launch of Ultra Fiesta in Brazil. In Puerto Rico, we launched Reign Tropical Storm, Reign Sour Gummy and Cafe -- Java Cafe Latte. Lastly, we launched Pipeline Punch in Peru. In EMEA, in the first quarter of 2025, we launched Monster Green Ultra Sugar, Juiced Bad Apple, Juiced Rio Punch, Ultra Fantasy Ruby Red, Ultra Peachy Keen, Ultra Strawberry Dreams, Burn Guava and Burn Orange Fire in certain countries in EMEA. Additional launches are planned throughout EMEA in 2025 of various products in different countries. In Australia, during the month of March, we launched Monster Ultra Fantasy Ruby Red. During the first quarter of 2025, we launched Monster Ultra Fantasy Ruby Red in Japan, Monster Ultra Strawberry Dreams in South Korea, Monster Aussie Lemonade in Hong Kong and Taiwan, and Monster Pipeline Punch in Vietnam. Additionally, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for the Monster brand in China and India, and are excited about the incremental expansion of the Predator brand in these two countries. Notably, in China, we implemented the national rollout of the Predator brand in all provinces. During the 2025 first quarter, no shares of the company’s common stock were repurchased, as of May 8, approximately $500 million remained available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase program. We estimate that on a foreign currency adjusted basis, April 2025 sales were approximately 16.7% higher than the comparable April 2024 sales, and 17.6% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis excluding the Alcohol Brand segment. We estimate that April 2025 sales on a non-foreign currency adjusted basis were approximately 15.3% higher than the comparable April 2022 sales, and 16.1% higher on a non-foreign currency adjusted basis excluding the Alcohol Brand segment. April 2025 has the same number of selling days as April 2024. We estimate that year-to-date sales through April 30, 2025 on a foreign currency adjusted basis excluding the Alcohol Brands were approximately 6.9% higher than the comparable period in 2024 and 5.8% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis including the Alcohol Brand segment. We estimate that year-to-date sales through April 30, 2025 on a non-foreign currency adjusted basis were approximately 3.3% higher than the comparable period in 2024, and 4.3% higher on a non-foreign currency adjusted basis excluding the Alcohol Brand segment. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches, the timing of price increases, the promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules. This affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintain inventory levels according to their own internal requirements, which they may alter from time-to-time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month, should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. The energy category continues to grow globally. We believe that household penetration continues to increase in the energy drink category. Growth opportunities in household penetration, per capital consumption, along with consumers’ need for energy, are positive factors for the category. We continue to expand our sales in non-Nielsen measure channels. Globally, as measured by our scanner track data, consumer demand remains strong. In the United States, the energy category, as measured by Nielsen, accelerated through the quarter and remained strong in April. Similarly, Monster sales at retail, as measured by Nielsen, accelerated through the quarter and remained strong in April. We continue to review opportunities for price increases domestically and internationally. Our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower landed costs to our EMEA region. The juice plant at our AFF facility in Ireland has now been completed. After trials, we expect the juice plant to be in production by midyear. We are excited for our 2025 innovation pipeline globally. We are currently exploring opportunities for our alcohol products in certain international jurisdictions. We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio, in a number of markets internationally. We are proceeding with plans for further launches of our affordable energy brands. I would now like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Hey, guys.
Rodney Sacks: Hi.
Kaumil Gajrawala: A couple questions on timing. You mentioned a bit about supply chain optimization and maybe some purchase timing from bottlers having an impact on the Q1 number. Can you maybe provide some details on how much that was or maybe what’s behind those comments?
Hilton Schlosberg: Yeah, I think, Kaumil, if I can take this question that, we mentioned that, the first quarter was impacted by bottler distributor ordering patents in the United States and EMEA. We cannot control how our bottlers order. They order according to their needs. And remember that in the early part of the quarter, there were significant closure days of distribution centers by a number of major bottlers. So you had an interesting situation in the quarter where the numbers were impacted by bottler distribution -- distributor ordering patents. We had adverse changes in Forex, as you know. Decreased sales in the Alcohol Brand segment. And the weather, which I mentioned earlier, there was one less selling day. And against this whole backdrop, you have these very difficult uncertain economic conditions. So that was a tale of the quarter. But then we turned you to April, where April was a really robust month. And we showed what the results would have been were the numbers cumulative, the sales numbers cumulative to April. So that’s a picture of the quarter. April, very strong, very robust, as we would have expected, given what had happened in the quarter. You’ve got the cumulative numbers to April. And then with regard to supply chain optimization, that really impacted gross profit and that together with the benefits in selling prices, really benefited the gross profit line.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Dara Mohsenian: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. So moving beyond the shipments, Rodney, you sounded pretty enthusiastic about the underlying trends we’re seeing in retail takeaway and the Nielsen numbers. So just given the broader macro situation, just wanted to get any perspective on if you think we’re seeing any macro impact on the category, either in the U.S. or internationally, again, looking at retail sales. And then also maybe just in the U.S., given we’ve seen the category rebound while a number of other consumer CPG segments have dropped off and we’ve seen category weakness elsewhere, just curious for your perspective on some of the drivers of the energy category rebound and how sustainable they might be going forward? Thanks.
Rodney Sacks: I mean, I think, Hilton will give you his view on it. I think that the important thing is that you’ve just got to look at the depletions. You look at the Nielsens. At the end of the day, they are a much more accurate and a more balanced reflection of the health of the brands that we have, health of our sales and health of the category. And I think those have shown increases and you just got -- and that’s why we pointed to this mismatching. And ultimately, though, it’s the consumer demand that tells ultimately where things are going to be headed. And those are continuing to improve through the quarter and continue to improve through April. And that’s why we did, and as Hilton mentioned, we’ve really given you the numbers for four months, which shows that continuing trend. And it’s similar even in overseas markets as well. You’ve seen some of the Nielsen numbers. You’ve seen some of the reported numbers of the bottlers. Again, I think look to the end demand, which is better represented by the Nielsens and depletions even from our bottlers than our numbers, which are a little more choppy. But we can’t really give you any more color on it than that. But other than to say the category is healthy. We had some slowdown a little bit last year. We also are seeing some improved numbers. And it’s an affordable luxury at the end of the day. And the numbers continue to be strong. And we are -- for that reason, we are very, very positive about our prospects going forward in the rest of the year.
Hilton Schlosberg: Yeah. I think that’s right. I mean, if you look at, for example, the bottlers that have reported and do report energy sales, CCP showed an increase of 12%. Hellenic in the quarter showed an increase of 26%. And then just off left field, we had a situation in Korea where LG reported an increase of 45.8%. So we’ve seen a lot of positive trends in the bottlers. We had these closures of distribution centers. And from that perspective, if you analyze the quarter and you take into account the direct business that we do, and we do a fair amount of direct business. But the majority, of course, is done through the distributors. You’ll see that the trend in the direct business was in line with what we would have expected. And if you look at the sales through the, sales to, not sales through, but the sales to the bottler distributors, there was a bit of choppiness in those numbers.
Operator: The next question comes from Filippo Falorni of Citi. Please go ahead.
Filippo Falorni: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to ask on gross margin, clearly very solid performance in Q1. You mentioned the drivers really being pricing and supply chain optimization. How should we think about those contributions going forward? And then on the aluminum side, clearly the Midwest premium has gone up quite a bit as a result of the tariff. So last quarter, you mentioned you were pretty well hedged in 2025. Can you give us an update on your hedging and potential mitigation action for the Midwest premium? Thank you.
Rodney Sacks: Yeah. So we use a lateral approach for hedging. And it’s very difficult and it’s somewhat expensive to hedge the Midwest premium. So to a limited degree, we are hedged with certain volumes in the Midwest premium. But we are -- we are nicely hedged on metal. But as all things happen, metals come down. So what we’re happy about is the fact that we try and mitigate our risk. That’s the objective of our hedging program. We don’t always win, but we mitigate our risk and that is very important. We don’t leave ourselves exposed. So talking about gross margins, looking forward, and you actually answered the question yourself because, yes, we are seeing an impact in the Midwest premium. Yes, we are seeing certain materials going up. So I wouldn’t expect that the second quarter margin will be as high as the first quarter margin. And let me leave it as that because we don’t give guidance. But I think you can read into what I’m saying.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Bonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you. Hi, everyone.
Hilton Schlosberg: Hi, Bonnie, we never thought you’d get on. What’s going on?
Bonnie Herzog: Well, you met me on earlier. I’m here waiting patiently. But I just have a couple of follow-up questions on your topline. You did give a lot of color. But first, I’d be curious to hear, how much lower were your reported sales during the quarter versus maybe your internal expectations? And then second, curious about your innovation pipeline. Are there any shipment timing impacts on innovation to consider in Q1 maybe versus Q2? I mean, you called out a lot. You highlighted a lot of innovation. So should we assume you have more innovation rolling out during the first half of this year versus the second half or is there a lot more planned for later this year? Thank you.
Hilton Schlosberg: There was more innovation rolling out in Q1 than in Q2. But it does take time. One of the great successes we’ve been able to achieve with Ultra Blue Hawaiian and with Vice Guava was we were able to get product on the shelves a lot quicker than ordinarily we would have. So you will see that there will continue to be an acceleration in distribution. But Q1 would see more innovation in sales than in Q2. And of course, there’s some loading that happens as the distributors get ready for the innovation that’s coming in the quarter.
Rodney Sacks: Just to add, just on the second half of the year, we will -- we do have some innovation planned for the fall. So there will be also some innovation in the second half as well.
Hilton Schlosberg: Correct. Correct.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy of BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.
Kevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good evening, guys. Two-part question for me and they’re related. I’d like to get your thoughts on pricing dynamics in the category. Your key competitor has not followed at this point and I wonder how concerning that is for you competitively. And then related to that, just how you think about your overall level of satisfaction from a market share perspective. And I ask that in the context that your value share has leveled off here sequentially. I know that’s been encouraging to the market. The flip side is your volume share is off, and that’s declining. You’re just not seeing the volume uplift. Naturally, there’s some demand elasticity with the pricing that you’ve taken. So two-part question, sort of overarching views on the pricing dynamics in the category. And then, secondarily, your overall level of satisfaction with what you’re seeing in the U.S. from a market share perspective? So thank you for that, guys. I appreciate it.
Hilton Schlosberg: Yeah. Kevin, if I could address that. Firstly, with regard to pricing, we are always looking at opportunities in the market based on various factors. We have and run our own play. So what the competitors do and what they don’t do really doesn’t impact our decision. And if you look at energy today, there’s a huge value proposition on energy versus carbonated soft drinks. Because traditionally, you saw there was a big divide between carbonated soft drinks and energy. And now, with the increases in carbonated soft drinks and the single serve carbonated soft drinks, you’ll see that that gap has dramatically reduced. So there are opportunities. We’ll consider them. And we’ll evaluate them as time comes. We’ve said that in Europe and in other parts of the world, we’ll continue to evaluate pricing as we will in the United States. And then, regarding share, obviously, it’s something that we’re very proud people here. And our objective is to increase and regain share. I mean, we just had a huge sales rally in -- for our sales organization and that was one of the major factors on the agenda. And Rob Gehring has that very pride of place in his mind is to regain market share. We’re very aware of it. And we believe we’ve got good plans to be able to accommodate it. We’ve got some great innovation in the pipeline. And we’ve also got to understand that encouraging, accelerating sales and volume trends in the United States are really encouraging, despite the price increase that we took. So, all in all, I think that we’ll do what we can and move forward.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks.
Rodney Sacks: On behalf of Monster, I’d like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. I would like to just mention that in my remarks on the April sales, I may have misadvertently referred to the comparable April as April 2022, as opposed to April 2024, just to clarify that. We continue to believe in the company and in our growth strategy, and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands, and to expand the company both at home and abroad, and in particular, capitalizing on our relationship with the Coca-Cola bottler system. We believe that we are well-positioned in the beverage industry and continue to be optimistic about the future of our company. One thing I would just like to perhaps just spend a minute on is to just say to you that, as most of you are aware, I have decided to step back from my position as Co-CEO and that will happen on -- after the Shareholder Meeting on the 12th of June. And so this will probably be my last meeting in which I will take in my capacity as Co-CEO. But that’s been 30 years, and I wanted to thank everybody. It’s been really a great privilege to be in this position, to have dealt with you guys, have taken these meetings, and been involved in every aspect. And I want to thank you, the analysts and the investors, for the support and confidence you’ve had in us, in me and the whole executive team. And I will still be involved as Chairman, but won’t be involved in my current position and look forward to continuing to having a relationship with everybody. But things, everything in life moves on and I just want to thank you all for that. Thank you very much for your attendance and I will probably speak to you guys at the Annual Shareholder Meeting in June and then we’ll move forward from there. Thanks very much.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-27 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Monster Beverages Company Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Co-CEOs, Rodney Sachs and Hilton Schlosberg. Please go ahead.
Rodney Sacks: Thanks. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and my Co-Chief Executive Officer is on the call, as is Tom Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom Kelly will now read our cautionary statement.

Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed on February 29, 2024 and are subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements, for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. I would also like to note that an explanation of the non-GAAP measures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call is provided in the notes in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated February 27, 2025. A copy of this information is also available on our website, www.monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks.
Rodney Sacks: Thanks, Tom. We continue to see sustained growth in the global energy drink category. In the United States, we are seeing a resurgence of growth in the energy drink category in the convenience, as well as in all measured channels reported by Nielsen. Our non-Nielsen channels continue to grow as well. Growth opportunities in household penetration and per capita consumption along with consumers' growing need for energy are positive trends for the category. Hurricanes Helene and Milton impacted sales at retail in certain states in October 2024. However, we have not determined the impact on our business. The alcohol segment operates a brewery in Brevard, North Carolina, which was closed for a week due to flooding from Hurricane Helene. This brewery was partially operational for a period and was fully operational by mid-November 2024. In the United States, the energy category according to Nielsen for the recently reported 13 weeks through February 15, 2025 grew at 6.2% versus the same period last year. In EMEA, the energy drink category according to Nielsen for our tracked markets for the recently reported 13 week period, which differ from country-to-country grew at approximately 14.4% versus the same period last year. In APAC, the energy drink category according to Nielsen and INTAGE for our tracked markets for the recently reported 13 week period, which differ from country-to-country grew at approximately 11.8% versus the same period last year. And in LatAm, the energy drink category according to Nielsen for our tracked markets for the recently reported 13 week period, which differ from country-to-country grew at approximately 20.2% versus the same period last year. In each case, these are done on a FX neutral basis. Certain items should be separately considered in evaluating the results for the quarter. These specific items are as follows: gross profit for the 2024 fourth quarter was adversely impacted by an increase in inventory reserves due to excess inventory levels in the Alcohol Brands segment of $4.1 million, in which I will now refer to as the Alcohol Brands Inventory Reserves. Operating expenses for the 2024 fourth quarter were adversely impacted by $130.7 million of impairment charges related to the Alcohol Brands segment. The impairment charges were primarily the result of operating and financial performance not meeting projections due in part to challenges in the category, as well as the decrease in projected ongoing operating and financial performance. In addition, operating expenses for the 2024 fourth quarter were adversely impacted by $1.8 million of company incurred legal expenses in connection with an intellectual property claim brought by the descendants of Hubert Hansen, in relation to the company's use of the Hubert Hansen name prior to the transaction with the Coca-Cola Company, which closed in 2015, and which we will now refer to as the Hansen Litigation. Operating income adjusting for these items rose 7.9% to $517.9 million in the 2024 fourth quarter. Net of tax, these items adversely impacted net income for the 2024 fourth quarter by $105 million and net income per diluted share by $0.10 per share. Diluted earnings per share for the 2024 fourth quarter adjusted for these items was $0.38 per share. As a reminder, the bank inventory step up and impairment in the Alcohol Brands segment were previously disclosed as items impacting profitability for the comparative 2023 fourth quarter. In addition to our GAAP condensed consolidated statement of income and other information and our GAAP consolidated balance sheet for the company for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, attached to our press release is a non-GAAP adjusted condensed consolidated statement of income and other information adjusting for the items impacting profitability and a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP information. We believe that these non-GAAP items are useful to shareholders on this call in evaluating our ongoing operating and financial results. These non-GAAP items should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of U.S. GAAP financial measures. The company achieved record fourth quarter net sales of $1.81 billion, in the 2024 fourth quarter. $1.81 billion, sorry, sorry, 4.7% higher than net sales of $1.73 billion in the comparable 2023 quarter, 4.8% excluding the Alcohol segment. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, net sales for the 2024 fourth quarter increased 7.8% or 7.9%, excluding the Alcohol segment. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 fourth quarter was 55.3% compared with 54.2% in the 2023 fourth quarter. Gross profit for the 2024 fourth quarter was adversely impacted by the Alcohol Brands inventory reserves, gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 fourth quarter, exclusive of the alcohol brands inventory reserves was 55.5%. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 fourth quarter was primarily the result of reduced input costs partially offset by geographical sales mix. On a sequential quarterly basis, gross margins were higher than the 2024 third quarter gross margins. Operating expenses for the 2024 fourth quarter was $621.2 million compared with $504.4 million in the 2023 fourth quarter. The increase in operating expenses were primarily the result of increased impairment charges within the Alcohol Brands segment, increased payroll expenses and increased sponsorship and endorsement expenses. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2024 fourth quarter were 34.3% compared with 29.2% in the 2023 fourth quarter. Adjusted operating expenses after making the adjustments described earlier, increased 5.5% to $488.7 million as compared to $463.2 million in the 2023 comparable quarter. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 fourth quarter were 27% compared with 26.8% in the 2023 fourth quarter. Distribution and warehouse expenses for the 2024 fourth quarter was $77.6 million or 4.3% of net sales compared to $79.6 million or 4.6% of net sales in the 2023 fourth quarter. Operating income in the 2024 fourth quarter decreased 12.2% to $381.2 million from $434 million in the 2023 comparative quarter. Adjusted operating income after making the adjustments described earlier increased 7.9% to $517.9 million as compared to $480.1 million in the 2023 comparable quarter. The effective tax rate for the 2024 fourth quarter was 29.9% compared with 18.5% in the 2023 fourth quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate for the 2024 fourth quarter was primarily attributable to a decrease in the stock-based compensation deduction for the 2024 fourth quarter and adjustment to the 2024 full year effective tax rate higher 2024 state income taxes and the establishment of a state valuation allowance relating to certain net operating losses of the Alcohol Brands segment. Net income for the 2024 fourth quarter was $270.7 million as compared to $367 million in the 2023 comparable quarter. Adjusted net income in the 2024 fourth quarter after making the adjustments described earlier were $375.7 million as compared to adjusted net income of $402.4 million in the 2023 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2024 fourth quarter decreased 20.8% to $0.28 from $0.35 in the fourth quarter of 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share after making the adjustments described earlier remained consistent at $0.38 per share for both the 2024 and 2023 fourth quarters. Net sales on a foreign currency adjusted basis increased 8.4% for the 2024 full year. Adjusted net income per diluted share was $1.62 per share for the 2024 full year compared with adjusted net income per share of $1.56 per share for the 2023 full year. Our fourth quarter financial results were again impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates in certain markets, Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales for the 2024 fourth quarter of $52.3 million. As previously reported, we implemented a 5% increase on our brands and packages, excluding bank, rain and rainstorm effective November 1, 2024 in the United States. We are continuing to monitor opportunities for further pricing actions, both domestically and internationally. According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks ended February 15, 2025, for all outlets combined, excluding convenience and gas, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 9% versus the same period a year ago. According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks ended February 15, 2025, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots increased by 6.2% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of the company's energy drink brands including Bang were up 4.4% in the 13-week period. Sales of Monster increased 4.8%. Sales of Reign were down 6.3%. Sales of NOS increased 2% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 0.8%. Sales of Red Bull increased 10%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended February 15, 2025, and sales in dollars in the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, increased 2.8%. And for the four weeks ended February 8, 2025 were 5.4% over the same period the previous year.

According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended February 15, 2025, the company's market share in the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increased from 36.8% to 36.9%, including Bang. Monster share increased from 29.1% a year ago to 29.2%. Reign’s share decreased 0.2 of a share point to 2.7%. NOS share decreased 0.1% of a share point to 2.5% and Full Throttle share remained at 0.7 of a point. Bang's share was 1.8%. Red Bull's share increased 1.9 share points to 36.9%. Market shares of certain competitors were as follows: CELSIUS, 7.3%; C4, 43.5%; GHOST, 2.9%; Five Hour, 2.9%; Rockstar 2.7%, and Alani Nu 2.2%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended February 15, 2025, sales in dollars in the coffee plus energy drink category, which included our Java Monster line, in the convenience and gas channel decreased 9.1% over the same period the previous year. Sales of Monster including Java Monster 300 was 7.9% lower in the same period versus the previous year. Sales of Starbucks Energy coffee were 16.6% lower.

According to Nielsen for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category increased 11.1% for the month of January 2025. Monster sales increased 13.7%. Monster's market share in value increased 0.7 of a point to 30% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Predator increased 27.9% and its market share increased 0.8 of a share point to 6.2%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen, all outlets combined in Brazil, the energy drink category increased 13.4% for the month of December 2024. Monster sales increased 15.7%/ Monster's market share in value increased 0.9 of a point to 47.7% compared to December 2023. In Argentina, due in part to the impact of inflation, related to local currency price increases, the energy drink category increased 98.7% for the month of January 2025. Monster sales increased 82.5%. Monster's market share in value decreased 4.5 points to 51.2% compared to January 2024. In Chile, the energy drink category increased 16.2% for the month of January 2025. Monster's sales increased 13%. Monster's market share in value decreased 1.1 points to 39.5%. Monster Energy remains a leading energy brand in value in Argentina, Brazil and Chile. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country-to-country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending January 26, 2025, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 16.3% to 17.2% in Belgium from 32% to 32.6% in Great Britain, back on our new Great Britain, Nielsen data base from 6% to 9.4% in the Netherlands and from 34.3% to 36% in Norway.

We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or four week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $711.5 million, 39.3% of total net sales in the 2024 fourth quarter compared to $637 million or 36.8% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2023.

In October, the Brevard, North Carolina production and shipping were severely impacted by Hurricane Helene. Production in Brevard normalized in November, while other facilities we utilized during the quarter to allow for a minimal overall disruption. In addition to the appointment of a new President of Monster Brewing announced last quarter, we have now restructured the senior management team in sales, marketing, strategy and operations divisions and will be implementing further adjustments in the coming months with the intent to optimize our personnel and facilities to support the current demands of our portfolio and innovation pipeline. We are currently shipping Beast, Pink Poison and Killer Sunrise in 24 ounce cans and we'll be launching Gnarly Grape in 24 ounce cans in the coming months. Miche, our newest flavored beer innovation will also be launched nationally in the coming months in two 24 ounce flavors, Chelada and Michelada. We are planning to launch the Beast internationally this summer in select markets, subject to regulatory approvals. We are planning for further innovation in Monster Brewing in the coming months. In October 2024, we launched Monster Ultra Vice Guava nationally. The initial response from both customers and consumers alike has been very positive on this innovation. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2025, we launched innovation across various brands, including Monster Energy Ultra Blue Hawaiian, Monster Energy Brew Triple Shot, Killer Brew Triple Shot, Monster Energy Juice Viking Berry, Reign Storm Tropical, Reign White Haze and Bang Energy Sour Ropes.

Additional launches are planned across all brands throughout EMEA in 2025.

Our products are currently sold in 355 ml cans in Korea. In February 2025, we launched Monster Ultra Strawberry Dreams in South Korea. In March, we are planning to introduce Monster Energy in a 250 ml can that contains our regular energy ingredients minus caffeine specifically for the on-premise channel in Japan. Additionally, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for the Monster brand in China and India and are excited about the incremental expansion of the Predator brand in these two countries, after positive results in several provinces in China in 2024, we will proceed with the national rollout of non-carbonated predator in 500 ml PET bottles starting next month. As of February 27, 2025, approximately $500 million remained available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase program. We estimate that on a foreign currency adjusted basis, including the Alcohol Brands segment, January 2025 sales were approximately 5.3% higher than the comparable January 2024 sales and 6.7% higher than January 2024, excluding the Alcohol Brand segment. We estimate that January 2025 sales on a non-foreign currency adjusted basis were approximately 1.5% higher than the comparable January 2024 sales and 2.8% higher than in January 2024, excluding the Alcohol Brands segment. January 2025 had the same number of selling days as January 2024. We believe January 2025 sales were adversely impacted by the California wildfires, and by other severe weather conditions in the United States, such as the Gulf Coast Blizzard affecting New Orleans in Florida as well as the northeastern ice storms. Our distribution partners warehouses and retail outlets were closed for certain time periods in these areas during January. However, we cannot or have not determined the impact on our business at this time. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules, this affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintain inventory levels according to their own internal requirements which they may alter from time-to-time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. The energy category continues to grow globally. We believe that household penetration continues to increase in the energy drink category. Growth opportunities in household penetration per capita consumption, along with consumers' need for energy or positive factors for the category. We continue to expand ourselves in non-Nielsen measured channels. As reported earlier, we implemented a price increase in the United States on November 1, 2024. We continue to review opportunities for price increases domestically and internationally. Our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower landed costs to our EMEA region. The juice plant at our AFF facility in Ireland has now been completed. After trials, we expect the juice plant to be in production by midyear. We're excited for our 2025 innovation pipeline globally we are currently exploring opportunities for our alcohol products in certain international jurisdictions. We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio in a number of markets internationally. We are proceeding with plans for further launches of our affordable energy brands. With respect to the California wildfires, just as with Hurricane Milton and Hurricane Helene, our team has been providing support, water, energy drinks, clothing and other items to the first responders and to local communities impacted by these events. I would now like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the full year. Thank you.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Bonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you. Hi, everyone.
Rodney Sacks: Hi, Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog: Hi. I wanted to ask a question on your gross margins in the quarter. Could you give us a little more color on the drivers behind the expansion? I guess I'm curious how much did the price increase on November 1 help, what about production of some of your feed drink volume in-house. I just wanted to confirm that you did in fact or you are in fact doing that. And then how big of a risk do you see from aluminum and tariffs? Are you still hedged on aluminum? And will this protect you some -- and I know you guys don't guide, but how are you feeling about further gross margin expansion this year in the context of the pricing you took and everything I just asked about? Thanks.
Hilton Schlosberg: Yeah. So Bonnie, thank you for that long question. I think it was more than one question. We'll try and answer them. The major drivers of gross margin in the quarter were reduced input costs, partially offset by geographical sales mix. Now there are a lot of other factors that influence gross margin, as you all know. For example, yes, the price increase did impact gross margin positively. But against that, we had other costs that are set off against gross sales, including increased commissions to the Coca-Cola company based on increased sales and increased profitability in EMEA as well as a tranche of other issues. Promotional allowances yes, were higher. Mainly driven by the fact that when one does entertain a price increase, we do ensure that commercial allowances are in place, so that consumers don’t get the sticker shock day one from the price increase. As regards tariffs, I think you all guess is good as mine. Things keep on changing day by day. And I think it would be – I discussed it with some of my colleagues prior to this call, and we think it would be really premature to even talk about tariffs because no one really knows what’s going to happen. However, we are hedged to quite a nice extent in 2025 with aluminum, and we have some hedges on the Midwest premium.
Operator: The next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Dara Mohsenian: Hi, guys. So clearly, you're enthusiastic about the energy category recovery we're seeing in the U.S. Can you also just give us some color or any thoughts on Monster's potential U.S. market share performance as we look going forward? I know you're not going to be specific, but just relative to a period of compression we've seen in recent periods. And also within that, maybe you can touch specifically on the U.S. innovation pipeline in 2025 versus 2024 and shelf space and how that might play into Monster's U.S. market share performance with that category recovery? Thanks.
Hilton Schlosberg: Okay. Rodney and I are going to split this question. So with regard -- let me start with shelf space. We have negotiated for increased shelf space this year and it's in the low-single digits. And we're really excited with the additions to our portfolio that we've been able to attract and increase shelf space. As regards the total category, we spoke at -- in New York about the global energy drink category growing substantially over the next few years to 2019. And I must just remind you that the U.S. category is now $21.2 billion. So it's hard to swing a dial on growth in a $21.2 billion category that we've seen historically. I think we will continue to see increases in the category, and you've seen that in the past few weeks, both the category in all measured channels has grown, the convenience we see as coming back. Trips are still down, but the shopping baskets in convenience are higher. So all-in-all, it all goes well for the category as a whole and for the category in the U.S. As regards market share, and I'll give you my take, we will always see competition. We've seen competition historically and we'll continue to see competition. And that will continue to obviously lean in to both ourselves and to rebuild market share, but there still is a very strong category and it's driven by two players, two major players, which is us and Red Bull.
Rodney Sacks: Agreed. And I think the category, we're also seeing growth internationally as well coming back. I mean everybody seems to have had a sort of a flattening of growth in that third quarter, whether it's U.S. or internationally for different reasons, none of us have really can explain it fully, but it certainly is growing, which is really pretty positive. We see this on a week-to-week basis. With regard to 2025 with innovation, we have got off to an early start. I think we've taken measures to try and sort of maximize the impact of our innovation and execution to step that up and we have strategies for that, which we started with Vice Guava. We have followed that up with Ultra Blue Hawaiian, and I'm just looking at the latest week numbers in Ultra Blue Hawaiian is one of the top 10 selling products and it's still gaining distribution. Our juice product, Viking Barry is also on a sales per point has got off to a good start. We've got the coffee category, we've got some good products. So we are actually very positive about innovation for this year. We think it will be positive for us. And we've got off to an early start on them with the bottlers. So, we also have some more innovation that we have planned down in the fall. Particularly, we are quite excited with the Bang relationship with Any Means Possible. We have a single SKU, which we launched with Bang, a new one. But the Any Means possible relationship combined with the flavor and combined with their social media, we think is going to be quite positive. And as you -- Bang is still growing. We are covering nicely and growing. So we are quite positive for that. We're also going to focus on Reign, which, as you know, is really one of two real performance brands at the moment, everybody has moved to different wellness in different areas. So we think that Reign is still a solid brand, and we're also obviously going to put focus and effort behind it. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Please go ahead.
Filippo Falorni: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to ask about the U.S. energy drink category. Obviously, we've seen the reacceleration in track channel data, your reported results in the U.S. seem to be tracking a little bit below what we see in the tracked channel data. So maybe can you comment a bit on the untracked portion of your business, if you've seen any slowdown, particularly in the Smaller Bodegas, Gas and Convenience stores that are not picked up. And any comment on the Hispanic population that we've heard from other companies seeing a little bit of pressure more recently? Thank you.
Hilton Schlosberg: I think that's what you said about the spending consumers probably really accurate. And I don't want to say anything more about that. As regards to January, and we reported the January numbers, I believe that they were affected significantly by weather. We never really -- we have a saying in this company that we avoid any discussion on whether and when we sell our products come rain and rain and shine. But December was a difficult month. It was a difficult month in terms of the wildfires and it was a difficult month in terms of everything that you saw on the East Coast relating to weather conditions. So January for me was -- I think it was an aberration. Other people may feel otherwise, but that's a personal view. And we've always got to appreciate that we sell to the bottlers and the distributors. They sell to the retailers and Nielsen is a factor of what the consumer buys at retail. So there's never really a -- there should be a correlation some people say, sometimes there is a correlation, often there isn't. But please remember that Nielsen is what the consumers take off at retail and not would we sell, we sell to the boxes.
Rodney Sacks: I think that just to reinforce that, I think that if you look at the Nielsens I know they're short periods, we don't like to often refer to them. But if you look at the last couple of weeks on a week-by-week basis, all measured channels, you can see Monster is pretty much got back into a close to an 8% growth rate in the measure, which is are the main areas. So we're seeing some good shoots coming out of after January, there clearly was some effect on the weather and again, as we pointed out previously, I think everybody's got to be cautious about looking at single months. There are other factors that affected. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you for the question, and good afternoon. I just wanted to go back to the -- your comment right on the innovation for Bang and using both Bang and Reign, as you had before for the functional portion of your portfolio. So I was wondering, if you can elaborate a little bit more on your plans for 2025 in terms of innovation in that specific segment, knowing that you called out like the player that was acquired by another -- by the third largest being more niche. So I wonder, how you see that transaction and how could that impact your plans or anything you're seeing from your customers and any feedback that you can share? Thank you.
Rodney Sacks: I think everybody knows Alani Nu (ph) had some good growth, and it's doing nicely. But it is very focused on younger female and that it is what it is. The fact of the matter is it is growing. I think that when we talk about Bang, I think it's not directly comparable to aligning new. And I think that in the case of Reign, it's very much more focused on performance category. So I think there are different positionings for these different brands. They're all able to find their own positions. And they will -- we'll continue to compete and see how they grow, but we think that we can distinguish the positioning for Reign from Bang and from NOS even, for example, in our portfolio in Reign Storm. And so we have a portfolio, and we're going to continue to manage them appropriately. We think that the other factors will not really feature. We'll see how the acquisition goes. They'll have to manage two brands, but that's a challenge they will obviously take on, but it's not for us to really comment on that.
Hilton Schlosberg: Yeah. And we have our own strategies as you can expect. And Alani Nu will probably continue to grow until they hit their ceiling on points of distribution. A lot of their growth is coming out of new distribution and they'll hit their ceiling on points of distribution. In fact, just like Celsius did. So we carry on, we run our business and we run our play, and we're very confident with the team here at Monster and with the products and the portfolio that we have in the innovation for this year and further innovation that we're working on, and that's coming.
Operator: The next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Christopher Carey: Hey, guys. Hope you're doing well. So there was a comment earlier in the call around potential to take additional pricing or that you're looking at incremental pricing or your always considering incremental pricing, I can't remember exactly how it was said. But can you just talk about the sorts of things that you're looking at in order to make that decision about new pricing. Is that incremental aluminum inflation? Is that tariffs? Are those sorts of decisions already made? New innovation conscious that you made some positive statements around being hedged on aluminum and a bit of Midwest premium, but just trying to contextualize what the -- how that decision process go? And when you would make that sort of decision and how that could all play out? Thanks so much for any context there.
Hilton Schlosberg: Sure. We always are looking for opportunities to increase pricing. We've had significant cost increases as everyone appreciates, that's why Bonnie asked the question on gross margin every quarter. And so please remember, we didn't take price on Reign Storm and Bang when we took pricing on the rest of the portfolio in November, there are opportunities there. And internationally, we continue to review pricing as we do with Monster in the U.S. And I think a lot will depend on where these tariffs and duties end up. And frankly, what our competitors do. But we have a very strong focus on trying to improve stockholder wealth, and that includes increasing pricing where there are opportunities to do so. However, we're not going to disadvantage our brands by increasing prices unnecessarily.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks.
Rodney Sacks: Thanks. On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad and in particular, capitalizing on our relationship with the Coca-Cola bottling system. We believe that we are well positioned in the beverage industry and continue to be optimistic about the future of our company. Thanks very much for your attendance.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-11-07 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good evening, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Company Third Quarter 2024 Conference Call. All participants are in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rodney Sacks and Mr. Hilton Schlosberg, Co-CEOs. Please go ahead.
Rodney C. Sacks: Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thanks for attending this call. I’m Rodney Sacks, Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer. He is also on the call, as is Tom Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom Kelly will now read our caution restatement.
Thomas J. Kelly: Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended and are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the Company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed on February 29, 2024, and quarterly reports on Form 10-K, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements for discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The Company assumes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. I would also like to note that an explanation of the non-GAAP measures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated November 7, 2024. A copy of this information is also available on our website at www.monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks.
Rodney C. Sacks: Thanks, Tom. The energy drink category continues to grow globally and has demonstrated resilience. In the United States, the energy drink category continued to experience slower growth rates. However, in all measured channels, excluding convenience, the energy drink category is growing at a faster rate. In the United States, the energy drink category in the convenience channel is beginning to show some improvement in October. Although, we do not normally refer to one-week Nielsen statistics and do not intend to do so on an ongoing basis, I think that it is noteworthy to mention that according to Nielsen, for the one-week ended October 26, 2024, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots increased by 3.7% versus the same period a year ago, while sales of the Company’s energy brands including Bang were up 2.9% and sales of Monster were up 2.2%. A number of other consumer packaged goods companies have also seen a tighter consumer spending environment for certain income groups and weaker demand in the quarter. Hurricanes Helene and Milton impacted sales at retail in certain states in September and October, 2024. However, we cannot determine the impact on our business. The alcohol segment operates a brewery in Brevard, North Carolina, which was closed for a week due to flooding from Hurricane Helene. This brewery is partially operational and is expected to be fully operational by mid November 2024. We believe that many consumers view energy drinks as an affordable luxury. Growth opportunities in household penetration and per capita consumption along with consumers growing need for energy are positive trends for the category. In EMEA, the energy drink category according to Nielsen for the recently reported 13-week periods for our tracked markets, which differ from country-to-country is growing at approximately 11.1% versus the same period last year on an FX neutral basis. In APAC, for our tracked markets, the energy drink category according to Nielsen and INTAGE for our tracked markets for the 13-week period ending September 2024 is growing at approximately 13.6% versus the same period last year also on an FX neutral basis. In LatAm, for our tracked markets, the energy drink category according to Nielsen for the recently reported 13-week periods, which differ from country-to-country is growing at approximately 21.1% versus the same period last year, again also on an FX neutral basis. Gross profit for the 2024 third quarter was adversely impacted by an increase in inventory reserves, due to excess inventory levels in the Alcohol Brands segment of $10.6 million, which I will refer to later in this call as the Alcohol Brands inventory reserves. Operating expenses for the 2024 third quarter were adversely impacted by a $16.7 million provision and $1.2 million of Company incurred legal expenses in connection with an intellectual property claim brought by the descendants of Hubert Hansen in relation to the Company’s use of the Hubert Hansen name prior to the transaction with the Coca-Cola Company, which closed in 2015. And, I will also refer to this later this call as the intellectual property claim. Net of tax, these items adversely impacted net income for the 2024 third quarter by $21.5 million and net income per diluted share by $0.02 per share. Diluted earnings per share on a pro forma basis for the 2024 third quarter adjusted for these items was $0.40 per share. On July 31, 2023, the Company completed its acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Vital Pharmaceuticals Inc. and its debtor affiliates. Inventory purchased as part of the Bang Transaction was recorded at fair value, which I will refer to as the Bang Inventory Step-Up. Certain of the purchased inventory was subsequently sold in the 2023 third quarter and was recognized through cost of sales at fair value. Gross profit was negatively impacted by approximately $7.8 million during the 2023 third quarter as a result. During the 2023 third quarter, in connection with the Bang Transaction, the Company recorded a gain of $45.4 million in interest and other income. During the 2023 third quarter, the Company incurred approximately $8 million of acquisition costs related to the Bang Transaction. Net of tax, these items positively impacted net income for the 2023 third quarter by $22.7 million and net income per diluted share by $0.02 per share. Diluted earnings per share on a pro forma basis for the 2023 third quarter adjusted for these items was $0.41 per share. In addition to our GAAP condensed consolidated statement of income and other information and our GAAP condensed consolidated balance sheet for the Company for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 attached to our press release is a non-GAAP adjusted condensed consolidated statement of income and other information adjusting for the items impacting profitability and a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP information. We believe that these non-GAAP items are useful to shareholders on this call in evaluating our ongoing operating and financial results. These non-GAAP items should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of U.S. GAAP financial measures. The Company achieved record third quarter net sales of $1.88 billion in the 2024 third quarter or 1.3% higher than net sales of $1.86 billion in the comparable 2023 quarter, 4.7% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis. Net sales on a foreign currency adjusted basis excluding the Alcohol Brand segment increased 5% in the 2024 third quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the 2024 third quarter was 53.2%, compared with 53% in the 2023 third quarter. Gross profit for the 2024 third quarter was adversely impacted by the Alcohol Brands inventory reserves. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 third quarter, exclusive of the Alcohol Brands inventory reserves, was 53.7%. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 third quarter was primarily the result of lower input costs, pricing actions in certain international markets, and the Bang Inventory Step-Up, partially offset by higher promotional allowances as a percentage of net sales, mainly to drive trial and awareness of the Bang Energy brand in the United States, as well as the Alcohol Brands inventory reserves. On a sequential quarterly basis, adjusted gross margins were higher than the 2024 second quarter gross margins. Operating expenses for the 2024 third quarter were $519.9 million compared to $473.2 million in the 2023 third quarter. The increase in operating expenses were primarily the result of increased payroll expenses, increased sponsorship and endorsement expenses, as well as the intellectual property claims. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2024 third quarter were 27.6%, compared with 25.5% in the 2023 third quarter. Adjusted operating expenses after making the adjustments described earlier increased 8% to $502 million as compared to $464.8 million in the 2023 comparable quarter. Distribution and warehouse expenses for the 2024 third quarter were $82.7 million or 4.4% of net sales compared to $85.7 million or 4.6% of net sales in the 2023 third quarter. Operating income for the 2024 third quarter decreased 6% to $479.9 million from $510.5 million in the 2023 comparative quarter. Adjusted operating income after making the adjustments described earlier decreased 3.5% to $508.4 million as compared to $526.8 million in the 2023 comparable quarter. The effective tax rate for the 2024 third quarter was 21.8%, compared with 22.2% in the 2023 third quarter. Net income decreased 18.1% to $370.9 million as compared to $452.7 million in the 2023 comparable quarter. Adjusted net income after making the adjustments described earlier, decreased 8.8% to $392.4 million as compared to $430 million in the 2023 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2024 third quarter decreased 11.7% to $0.38 from $0.43 in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share after making the adjustments described earlier decreased 1.6% to $0.40 per share as compared to $0.41 per share in the 2023 comparable quarter. Our third quarter financial results were again impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates in certain markets. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales for the 2024 third quarter of $62.8 million. We estimate that diluted earnings per share were adversely impacted by approximately $0.03 per share due to the unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. As previously reported, we have taken a 5% increase on our brands and packages, excluding Bang, Reign, and Reign Storm, effective November 1, 2024 in the United States. We are continuing to monitor opportunities for further pricing actions in our international markets. The Company continues to have market share leadership in the energy drink category for all outlets combined in the United States for the 13-week period ended October 26, 2024. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13-weeks through October 26, 2024, all outlets combined excluding convenience, sales in dollars in the energy category, including energy shops increased by 4.9% versus the same period a year ago. According to the Nielsen report for the 13-weeks through October 26, 2024, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including energy shots increased by 1.9% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of the Company’s energy brands including Bang were down 0.6% in the 13 week period. Sales of Monster declined 1.8%. Sales of Reign were down 2.9%. Sales of NOS increased 2.9% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 5.4%. Sales of Red Bull increased 5%. According to Nielsen, for the four-weeks ended October 26, 2024, sales in dollars in the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increased 1.5% over the same period the previous year. Sales of the Company’s energy brands including Bang were flat in the latest four-week period in the convenience and gas channel. Sales of Monster decreased by 1.6% over the same period versus the previous year. Reign sales decreased 4.4%, NOS was up 3.9%, and Full Throttle was down 4.4%. Sales of Red Bull were up 5.6%. According to Nielsen, for the four-weeks ended October 26, 2024, the Company’s market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, decreased from 37.3% to 36.8%, including Bang. Monster’s share decreased from 29.7% a year ago to 28.7%. Reign share decreased 0.2 of a share point to 2.8%. NOS’s share increased 0.1 of a share point to 2.6% and Full Throttle share remained at 0.7%. Bang’s share was 1.9%. Red Bull share increased 1.4 share points to 35.9. Market share of certain competitors were as follows: CELSIUS 7.7, C4 3.4, 5-Hour 3.1, Rockstar 2.8 and GHOST 3.1. According to Nielsen, for the four-weeks ended October 26, 2024, sales in dollars in the Coffee + Energy Drinks category, which includes our Java Monster line in the convenience and gas channel, decreased 7.9% over the same period the previous year. Sales of Java Monster, including Java Monster 300 were 3% lower in the same period versus the previous year. Sales of Starbucks Energy were 14.8% lower. Java Monster’s share of the Coffee + Energy Drinks category in the four-weeks ended October 26, 2024 was 58.6%, up three points, while Starbucks Energy’s share was 40.8%, down 3.3 points. According to Nielsen, in all measured channels in Canada, for the 12-weeks ended October 5, 2024, the energy drink category increased 7.7% in dollars. Sales of the Company’s energy drink brands increased 8.3% versus a year ago. The market share of the Company’s energy drink brands increased 0.2 of a point to 40.7%. Monster sales increased 3.9% and its market share decreased 1.3 points to 35%. NOS’s sales increased 16.2% and its market share increased 0.1 of a share point to 1.3%. Full Throttle sales decreased 3.5% and its market share decreased 0.1 of a point to 0.05%. According to Nielsen, for all our efforts combined in Mexico, the energy drink category increased 16.3% for the month of September 2024. Monster sales increased 11.3%. Monster’s market share in value decreased 1.3 points to 27.6% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Predator increased 18.6% and its market share increased 0.1 of a share point to 6.2%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and or negatively by sales in the Oaxaca convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the Oaxaca convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Brazil, the energy drink category increased 19.9% for the month of September 2024. Monster sales increased 28%. Monster’s market share in value increased 3.1 points to 48.2%, compared to September 2023. In Argentina, due in part to the impact of inflation related local currency price increases, the energy drink category increased 202.5% for the month of September 2024. Monster sales increased 182.5%. Monster’s market share in value decreased 3.8 points to 53%, compared to September 2023. In Chile, the energy drink category increased 11.7% for the month of September 2024. Monster sales increased 12.9%. Monster’s market share in value increased 0.5 point to 40.3%. Monster Energy remains the leading energy brand in value in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. I would like to point out the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country-to-country.

We again put out that certain market statistics that cover single months or four-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and or negatively by promotions and other trading factors during those periods. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $760.1 million 40.4% of total net sales in the 2024 third quarter, compared to $733.7 million or 39.5% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2023. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $62.8 million in the 2024 third quarter, of which $26.5 million related to Argentina. In EMEA, net sales in the 2024 third quarter increased 6.8% in dollars and increased 10.4% on a currency neutral basis over the same period in 2023. In EMEA, our sales were impacted by bottler retailer disruptions in certain key accounts in Western Europe, as well as supply disruptions in South Africa. These disruptions reduced dollar sales by an estimated 2.9% in EMEA in the quarter. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 third quarter was 35.4% compared to 31.1% in the same quarter in 2023. We are pleased that in the 2024 third quarter Monster gained market share in Great Britain, the Netherlands, Poland, Republic of Ireland, South Africa and Spain. In Asia Pacific, net sales in the 2024 third quarter increased 4% in dollars and increased 8.8% on a currency neutral basis over the same period in 2023. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 third quarter was 40.2% versus 43.2% in the same period in 2023. Net sales in Japan in the 2024 third quarter decreased 7.6% in dollars and increased 0.2% on a currency neutral basis. In South Korea, net sales in the 2024 third quarter decreased 8% in dollars and decreased 2.2% on a currency neutral basis as compared to the same quarter in 2023, largely due to the timing of production schedules this year. Monster remains the market leader in Japan and South Korea. In China, net sales in the 2024 third quarter increased 15.4% in dollars and increased 15.8% on a currency neutral basis, as compared to the same quarter in 2023. We remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for the Monster brand in China and are excited about the recent launch of Predator, which is being rolled out to additional markets in China later this year and during 2025. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 13.5% in dollars and increased 13.8% on a currency neutral basis.

We remain the market share leader in Argentina and our market share in the quarter is 55.1%. Monster Brewing had a challenging third quarter. Net sales for the Alcohol Brand segment were $39.8 million in the 2024 third quarter, a decrease of approximately $2.5 million or 6% lower than the 2023 comparable quarter, mainly as a result of lower sales of craft beers. In addition, as mentioned earlier, due to excess inventories of certain Monster Brewing brands, it was necessary to increase inventory reserves in that segment by $10.6 million. In addition to the appointment of a new President of Monster Brewing announced last quarter, we have now restructured the Senior Management team in the alcohol division and are continuing to consolidate production facilities to maximize efficiencies. The Beast Unleashed was rebranded to The Beast. The brand is now available in all 50 states through a network of beer distributors. The Beast was launched in the State of Utah in July. We are currently launching our second variety pack of The Beast in 12 packs, which includes Mean Green and three new flavors Pink Poison, Gnarly Grape and Killer Sunrise. The Beast Variety Pack 2 is currently available in 48 states. The Jai Alai IPA brand, family’s first major refresh since 2017 is now shipping to all available markets. Oskar Blues first non-alcoholic brew designated Dale’s will be available next month in select markets. We launched Monster Energy Ultra Vice Guava in the United States in October 2024. Initial response from customers and consumers alike has been very positive on this innovation. In Latin America, during the Q3 of 2024, we launched Monster Ultra Peachy Keen in Mexico, Monster Ultra Paradise in Peru, Monster Zero Ultra and Juice Monster Mango Loco in the Dominican Republic and Juice Monster Pipeline Punch in Costa Rica. In Australia, during the third quarter of 2024, we launched Monster Ultra Violet. In EMEA in the third quarter of 2024, we launched Monster Reserve, Orange Dreamsicle, Juiced Aussie Lemonade, Juiced Bad Apple, Juiced Mango Loco, Ultra Black, Ultra Golden Pineapple, Ultra Peachy Keen, Ultra Rosa, Ultra Strawberry Dreams, and Ultra White in a number of countries. Additional launches are planned across all brands throughout EMEA in 2024. During the third quarter of 2024, we launched Papillon in a 500 ml aluminium bottle in Japan and Ultra Peachy Keen in Singapore. In China, we expanded the launch of Predator Gold Strike, which was launched in 11 provinces in China at the end of April in a non-carbonated 500 ml PET bottle. We launched in two additional provinces Guangxi and Fujian in September. We are planning to launch Predator in a number of additional provinces in 2025. In India, we extended the Predator Gold Strike carbonated 250 ml PET bottle beyond the Delhi region to the Northeast states in July and Madhya Pradesh in September. We will continue adding additional states in 2025. We remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for the Monster brand in China and India and are excited about the expansion of Predator in these two countries. During the 2024 third quarter, the company purchased approximately 11.3 million shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $47.32 per share for a total amount of $534.7 million. As of November 6, 2024, approximately $500 million remained available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase program. We estimate that October 2024 sales were approximately 4.8% higher than the comparable October 2023 sales and 5% higher than October 2023, excluding the Alcohol Brand segment. We estimate that on a foreign currency adjusted basis, including the Alcohol Brand segment, October 2024 sales were approximately 5.8% higher than the comparable October sales and 6.1% higher than October 2023, excluding the Alcohol Brand segment. October 2024 had one more selling day compared to October 2023. On our third quarter conference call in November 2023, we reported that gross sales in the month of October 2023, including the alcohol segment, were approximately 24.8% higher than October 2022 gross sales, which presented a high hurdle rate for the company this year. October 2023 had one more selling day than October 2022. A portion of the increase in the October 2024 sales may be attributed to advanced purchases by our customers in anticipation of the price increase in November in the United States. However, such amounts cannot reasonably be determined. Hurricanes Helene and Milton impacted sales at retail in certain states in September October 2024. Again, however, we cannot determine the impact on our business at this time. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as for example selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributing centers, as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules. This affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintain inventory levels according to their own internal requirements, which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Firstly, the energy category continues to grow globally. We believe that household penetration continues to increase in the energy drink category. Growth opportunities in household penetration per capita consumption, along with consumers’ need for energy, are positive factors for the category. We continue to expand our sales in non-Nielsen measured channels. As reported earlier, we’ve implemented a price increase in the United States on November 1, 2024. We continue to review opportunities for price increases internationally. Our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower landed costs to our EMEA region. The juice plant at our AFF facility in Ireland has now been completed. After trials, we expect the juice plant to be in production in early 2025. We’re excited for the launch of Monster Ultra Vice Guava. The Call of Duty unpacked gaming promotion, which kicked off last month, has received positive consumer response, with the publishers reporting that it’s the biggest Call of Duty release in the franchise’s history. We are currently exploring opportunities for our alcohol products in certain international jurisdictions. We are seeing some acceleration in the sales and market share of Bang Energy and remain excited for the future of this brand within our overall product portfolio. We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio in a number of markets internationally. We are proceeding with plans for further launches of our affordable energy brands. I would like to now open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone.
Rodney C. Sacks: Hi Andrea.
Andrea Teixeira: I want to just go back to the expectation of the flow through from pricing and how much you had to deal back on that? And how is your view on the state of the energy drink category given what’s happening in particular now with October understandably, but one extra selling day, it might be a little soft from what I think investors would expect. So, I would appreciate your views on both. Thank you.
Thomas J. Kelly: Yes. So, Andrea, when we have a price increase, we have to see where that price increase settles. And once we see a price increase settle and determine in what direction it’s heading, what the elasticity of demand is, we are then in a better position to determine what promotional activity, if any, needs to be set against the brands. So, it’s a really difficult question to answer at this time.
Rodney C. Sacks: I think Andrea had a couple of other questions. Do you want to quickly go through your other questions, Andrea?
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you, Hilton. Yes, I was just saying if there is any pull forward that you saw, so that it would inform some of that. I mean, I would say October would have been stronger if that’s the case. Would you say there was any pull forward for the pricing? In other words, like the retailers would take in more inventory ahead of the pricing?
Rodney C. Sacks: Okay. So, we sell to the distributors, right, the Coca Cola distributors. And we allow them a certain amount that they can buy in and we cut off the old pricing in the middle of October. So, I’m not sure and we’ve looked at it and we cannot determine with reasonable certainty what if any of that increase was attributable to buy ins. I suspect there could have been some, but we just can’t determine that. And in the same vein, it’s hard to determine what the impact of the hurricanes were Milton and Helene were on the business. We know that at retail it was impacted and we’ve done some work to try and assess the extent to which our own business could have been impacted. But again, it’s difficult to determine. What we can say is that, if you look at the territories that were impacted by the hurricanes, both of them, there’s probably a 1% differential between Nielsen activity in those territories and the activity through the U.S. So, there definitely was an impact. But again, we can’t determine the impact on our business.
Andrea Teixeira: And then in terms of state of the union for the energy category as we stand right now, I’ll be appreciative of knowing your view.
Rodney C. Sacks: Well, if we look at foot traffic in convenience, convenience is 62% of the Nielsen category for energy drinks. And we look at foot traffic and we talk to our retailers we get some input from third party market research companies and refer to the one anecdotal week that we spoke about earlier on this call. I think we have and it’s again a personal view, I think we’ve reached the bottom and are very close to the bottom. And I think here in Monster anyway, we actually feel good about things coming back. I mean, we saw what happened today that there was a rate cut. The election is over, which probably will give consumers bigger better confidence whichever party got in. I think there was some concern about the election. Now it’s over. We’ve passed that. We’ve got a rate cut today. And what we’ve seen in our industry is that there hasn’t been a change in consumer preferences and a change to different types of drinks. Our consumers have stayed with energy drinks and instead of, we believe instead of drinking three a week or four a week, they’ve been drinking one or so less.
Andrea Teixeira: Okay, helpful. Thank you.
Thomas J. Kelly: Yes, I think it is quite noteworthy. If you look at we started the Nielsen for the period ended 26 October. If you look at the latest 13 week period, the category was up 1.9. You look at the latest 14 weeks, the whole category in general was up 3.2 and the latest week is 3.7. So that trend has been and that’s why we refer to it. We think there is some recovery trend there, but we’ll have to wait and see with how that pans out.
Rodney C. Sacks: Yes. And then just getting back to October very quickly, we did mention on the call, we had a really high hurdle rates over last year. So, that’s another factor to bear in mind when you look at the October increases, which I thought were actually quite good.
Operator: Your next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities.
Christopher Carey: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Can you just maybe touch on how you see inventory levels or how you saw inventory levels going into October? And really what I’m getting at here is, is it just a comp or because you sound quite good on consumption trends, but maybe distributors were still a bit reticent to take on more inventory. And now that the consumption is coming through, perhaps do you feel there could be a resumption into the remainder of the quarter? Because I think basically what’s getting contemplated right now is if you’re kind of running flattish for the quarter, excluding the extra day or if this is just comp and the consumption trends should start to show through in your numbers as well. So any comment there would be maybe helpful.
Rodney C. Sacks: Yes, happy to do that, Chris. The way our business works, we sell to the Coke distributors. They place orders and we execute those orders. So, they have sophisticated systems that take into account consumption. That’s one of the factors, weather another factor and a whole bunch of other factors and they order product that we deliver. So, we also have a some we have a small direct business and we’ve spoken about the non-measured channels, which is done directly by us. But generally, we execute orders according to customer requirements. So, some of our competitors have hiccups in inventory. We don’t our business doesn’t behave in that way. We supply orders according to what our customers order.
Operator: Your next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi.
Filippo Falorni: Hi, good afternoon, guys. I wanted to ask about just your comment about the improvement in the category in October. How much do you think innovation plays a role as well? You sounded excited about the Vice Guava. Just general thoughts of if you think innovation can also drive further acceleration into the U.S. category as you think into October and the balance of the year? Thank you.
Rodney C. Sacks: Look, I think innovation does drive some consumption, but we’ve had innovation. We had probably three or four new innovative products in the first half of the year. We only really started to get product on shelf on our latest innovation which is one SKU sort of towards the end of October. So yes, there has been some benefit from that if you take the one week numbers. But I think overall, I don’t think it has that has had much impact. I think the overall impact that we’re seeing across a number of our other SKUs is also been trending sort of upwards as well. We see the South point just moving in a better direction. So, again, a short period of time doesn’t make a whole summer. But at the end of the day, we do start feeling because everybody’s been seeing the slower traffic and the sort of this little bit of stagnation in the category. But we do see signs of it starting to re-emerge and consumers being able to go back into stores and not buying again.
Thomas J. Kelly: Yes. I mean, we said earlier, we believe the overall macroeconomic conditions are improving and that’s positive. And the foot traffic inconvenience, I think that’s another factor. As I mentioned earlier, we get third party research. We talk to our customers and that’s all positive. So, add that to this equation, and I think you’ll maybe come out with the kind of answer that we’re thinking about here as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel.
Mark Astrachan: Yes. Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Hope all is well.
Rodney C. Sacks: Hi, Mark.
Mark Astrachan: I wanted to ask about gross margin in EMEA. I know it’s sort of specific, but it’s one of those questions that I think a lot of people are curious about and don’t have a huge amount of color. The trends have really improved over the last couple of years, but you’re still decently below 2022 levels or 2021 levels, I should say. I guess the question is without asking for guidance because I know you don’t want to give it, what do we think about from here? I mean, is it reasonable to think that you can get back to 2021? And if you don’t want to specifically answer that, what are the trends that have led to the improvement in that region from a gross margin standpoint? And how sustainable are they?
Hilton H. Schlosberg: Well, we have taken price. And we’ve taken price historically in a number of international markets and we continue to examine opportunities to do so. The cost of production and the cost of raw materials, there have been increases over time and significantly increases since COVID. We’re doing our very best to manage and hedge aluminium exposure, which is obviously a big cost in this company. So, we use a ladder, which we may have spoken about on previous calls, but if we didn’t, I’ll talk about it now. We have a ladder strategy, where we execute hedges to assist in managing aluminium exposure, and we really do examine that on a weekly basis or semi twice a month. So, that’s something that we look at. So, all in all, we have a business that is focused some in the U.S. you heard about the numbers overseas, which are growing and they have lower margins, although we spoke about the EMEA margins on this call that have moved up in the quarter, which is the trend we are looking to achieve. And then we have alcohol, which is currently is at a lower margin lower percentage margin than the rest of the business. So, we here are very focused on improving margin wherever we can and we will not stop in that pursuit. But it’s something that we’re carrying on working on and it’s a work in progress.
Rodney C. Sacks: Just to mention, I think you referred to EMEA largely. If you look at the last four quarters, we’ve been margins have continued to improve each quarter. Are you still about the whole company? I thought you talked about EMEA. Mark, what are you talking about? Mark? I’ll just give Mark comes out really relative to EMEA. So, I’ll just complete that to say that we do have the juice plant coming into production pretty much early next year. And together with the measures Hilton has indicated I think that we’ll see we’ve sort of got positive about the EMEA improving in margin going forward and whether it can get back to 2021, I’m not sure. So sorry, one was a question about the overall margin and I just sort of focused on EMEA. That’s good.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS.
Peter Grom: Thanks, operator. Good afternoon, everyone.
Rodney C. Sacks: Hey Peter.
Peter Grom: I guess, I just wanted to go back to the advanced purchases. I get it’s a lot of moving pieces and the hurricane noise probably makes it harder. But I think back in 2018 when you did the November price increase, you were at that point at least able to estimate the impact from advanced purchases ahead of the price increases. I’m just curious, is there a reason why this time may be different and you’re not able to kind of estimate that? And then just on gross margin, obviously, you would love some perspective on the path from here. You kind of alluded to it here. But can you maybe just talk about what you’re seeing from a commodity perspective and kind of how you see inflation evolving from this point? Thanks.
Hilton H. Schlosberg: Okay. Where we want to start. You want to start about commodities or advanced purchases?
Peter Grom: Whatever you want.
Hilton H. Schlosberg: Okay. All right. We have the option. So, I think the difference this time versus the previous price increase was that we cut off our price increase the favorable price increase mid-October. So with any customer who purchased product after mid-October, they actually paid the higher price. So, as we look at the whole structure, everything that happened in October, it’s really it became a very difficult exercise to determine what, if any of the price increase could have impacted October sales. So, that’s the bottom line. If we could have done a better exercise, we would have, but it became too secured as to try and find a sensible answer. So, we’d rather not give it and we’ll see the impact on the quarter when the quarter is over. And then in commodities, I think everybody knows that what’s happening with aluminium. And I mentioned the extent that we have a ladder approach and we build up that ladder as time goes by. There’s already a tariff on aluminium and we’re hoping that the tariff will not increase, but there is already a tariff on aluminium. And as regards some of our other commodities, we have seen increases in some and we’ve seen decreases in other. We buy a lot of commodities and it’s really it’s going to take us five minutes to go through them all. But what I can say is that generally we are seeing increases and in certain commodities like for example, aluminium, like for example, sugar and there are other commodities that have stayed the same or minimally decreasing. So, the climate that we’re looking at for commodities is one of taking aluminium out of the picture, which is showing significant increases, is one of relatively manageable factors in increases.
Operator: Thank you. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks.
Rodney C. Sacks: Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I would like to thank everyone for their continued interest and support of the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate, to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. And in particular, capitalizing on our relationship with the Coca Cola bottler system. We believe that we are well positioned in the beverage industry and continue to be optimistic about the future of our company. We hope that you remain safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-08-07 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Company Second Quarter 2024 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please also note this event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Co-CEOs, Rodney Sacks and Hilton Schlosberg. Please go ahead.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thanks for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, is on the call; as is Tom Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom Kelly will now read our cautionary statement.

The company assumes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks.
Rodney Sacks: Thanks, Tom. The energy drink category in the United States and in certain other countries experienced lower growth rates in the second quarter. Retailers have reported a reduction in convenience store foot traffic and we have seen a shift in retail towards more mass and dollar channels. Other beverage and consumer packaged product companies have also seen a tighter consumer spending environment and weaker demand in the quarter. The energy category globally continues to grow and has demonstrated resilience as we believe that consumers view energy drinks as an affordable luxury. We believe that household penetration continues to increase in the energy drink category. Growth opportunities in household penetration per capita consumption, along with consumers' need for energy or positive factors for the category. We continue to expand ourselves in non-Nielsen measured channels. The company achieved record second quarter net sales of $1.9 billion in the 2024 second quarter or 2.5% higher than net sales of $1.85 billion in the comparable 2023 quarter, 6.1% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis, 4.3% exclusive of Argentina's impact. Net sales on a foreign currency adjusted basis, excluding the alcohol brands segment increased 7.4% in the 2024, second quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 second quarter was 53.6% compared with 52.5% in the 2023, second quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 second quarter as compared to the 2023 second quarter was primarily the result of decreased freight-in costs, pricing actions in certain markets and lower aluminum can costs partially offset by production inefficiencies. On a sequential quarterly basis, gross margins were 0.5% below 2024 first quarter margins, primarily as a result of higher allowances certain of which we believe are nonrecurring as well as production inefficiencies. Operating expenses for the 2024 second quarter were $492.3 million, compared with $450.4 million in the 2023 second quarter. The increase in operating expenses were primarily the result of increased sponsorship and endorsement expenses, increased payroll expenses and increased storage and warehouse expenses. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2024 second quarter were 25.9%, compared to 24.3% in the 2023 second quarter. Distribution and warehouse expenses for the 2024 second quarter were $87.4 million or 4.6% of net sales compared to $82 million or 4.4% of net sales in the 2023 second quarter. Operating income for the 2024 second quarter increased 0.6% to $527.2 million from $523.8 million in the 2023 comparative quarter.

Diluted earnings per share for the 2024 second quarter increased 5% to $0.41 from $0.39 in the second quarter of 2023. As previously reported, we will be taking an approximately 5% price increase on our core brands and packages effective November 1, 2024, in the United States.

The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively ourselves in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Brazil, the energy drink category increased 19.1% and for the month of June 2024. Monster sales increased 29.1%, Monster's market share in value increased 3.7 points to 48.1% compared to June 2023, in Argentina, due in part to the impact of inflation-related local currency price increases.

In India, predated Gold Strike in a PET format which was launched as a test in 1 region at the end of 2023 is also meeting expectations. We are planning to launch that pack format in additional regions in India later this year. We remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for the Monster brand in China and India and are excited about the expansion of Predator in these 2 countries. On June 10, 2024, the company announced the final results of its modified Dutch auction tender offer, which expired on June 5, 2024. The company accepted for purchase approximately 56.6 million shares of common stock at a purchase price of $53 per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $3 billion excluding fees and expenses related to the tender offer. In addition, during the 3 months ended June 30, 2024, the company repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares over common stock at an average purchase price of $49.55 per share for a total consideration of approximately $107.7 million, excluding broker commissions. Subsequent to June 30, 2024, the company repurchased approximately 3.9 million shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $49.59 per share for total consideration of approximately $192.2 million, excluding broker commissions. As of August 6, 2024, approximately 342.4 million shares remained available for purchase -- sorry, $342 million remained available for purchase under the previously authorized repurchase program. We estimate that July 2024 sales were approximately 5.9% higher than the comparable July 2023 sales and 6.1% higher than July 2023, excluding the alcohol brand segment. We estimate that on a foreign currency adjusted basis, including the alcohol brands segment July 2024 sales were approximately 9.4% higher than the comparable July sales and 9.6% higher than July 2023, excluding the alcohol brands segment. July 2024 had 2 more selling days compared to July 2023. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules. This affects the dates in which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintain inventory levels according to their own internal requirements, which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. The energy category continues to grow globally. We believe that household penetration continues to increase in the energy drink category. Growth opportunities in household penetration per capita consumption along with consumers' need for energy or positive factors for the category. We continue to expand our sales in non-Nielsen measured channels. We are pleased to report that our pricing actions have not significantly impacted consumer demand. As reported earlier, we are planning a price increase in the United States on our core brands and packages effective November 1, 2024. We continue to review opportunities for price increases internationally. Our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower landed costs to our EMEA region. We are in the process of constructing a juice facility at our AFF flavor facility in Ireland, which we anticipate will be completed later this year. We're excited for the launch of Monster Energy Ultra Vice Guava in October 2024. Monster Brewing continues to provide opportunities within the alcohol brand segment. We're excited about the opportunities that the acquisition of the Bang Energy brand presents to us and believe that the brand fits well within our broader portfolio of energy drink brands. We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio in a number of markets internationally. We are proceeding with plans for further launches of our affordable energy brands. I would like to now open the floor to questions about the quarter.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.
Dara Mohsenian: The commentary on the U.S. category was helpful. Could you just put the recent slowdown you're seeing maybe in context versus other soft patches if you go back in history just in terms of drivers, magnitude, et cetera, just to give us some insight on how long you expect this to last? And also within that, maybe you can just touch on the promotional environment and how that might impact your plans to maybe cushion some of the pending U.S. price increase with promotion and how you guys think through that?
Rodney Sacks: Sure. Dara, historically, we've seen declines in quarterly year-over-year volumes, really only during the financial crisis and COVID lockdowns in the U.S., and they particularly significantly impacted foot traffic. The current situation in the U.S. is actually relatively unprecedented. And we've not seen inflation rates, and we haven't seen inflation levels, I'm sorry, and interest rates for one heck of a long time. And we believe that those have contributed to the slowdown. If you look internationally and those markets traditionally have been -- have a longer history of energy drinks. We saw and have seen slowdowns in certain European countries over the periods. And in each case that we've seen them, the levels have, in fact, rebounded. So at the end of the day, when you look at the positive factors, we believe that energy drinks certainly are a need state, consumers want energy drinks and Household penetration is growing, all the things we spoke about really on this call. And what we like other consumer products companies, we see this decline primarily driven by a reduction in consumer spending and the lower foot traffic in the convenience channel. We've seen reports of foot traffic convenience channel being down by as much as 3% to 3.5%. And then a swing towards more grocery mass on -- online purchasing. So it's kind of a situation where we are a blue collar brand. And our consumers are more hard pressed than consumers in other categories. And that's why maybe we have seen a larger reduction than other competitive products in the space. But at the end of the day, some of those competitive products have had price increases, which we have not had yet and we will have later this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan.
Andrea Teixeira: I was hoping if you can talk about the -- basically about the channels, you discuss the mass channels and discounts being 1 and how you've been able to shift for those consumers who are looking for basically more affordable energy. And you did a reference to to production challenges internationally. Is there a way to think about it and the impact and if it's temporary, how we should be thinking about those?
Rodney Sacks: The production challenges, which were in Germany have largely been resolved now. It is a situation where there was a lack of capacity in a particular plant, we set up facilities in other manufacturing entities and then the plants in Germany that the distribution points in Germany we're unable to accept product because there were -- they had challenges getting product in because we have a very large market in Germany. So it was a mix of factors. By the end of the day, we're back and running and we don't anticipate a recurrence of that issue in Germany this quarter.
Hilton Schlosberg: Just to give color on the German issue. You must appreciate that in the second quarter, they had the European soccer championships, and there was a lot of extra demand a lot of unusual things happen, and that's why we ended up with this challenge. Which we think was unusual, and it's not likely to occur again in the future, and we've taken steps to address it for -- in the future and have more visibility.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from Jefferies.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Can you try to just kind of reconcile the idea of still taking a price increase with the slowdown in the category. The commentary on who your core consumer is, they're being a little bit more careful doesn't seem to align with the idea to take a price increase, later?
Rodney Sacks: Yes. Kaumil, if you look at our pricing, where we are relative to other other beverages that we would regard as kind of comparative. Those are the beverages, they've dramatically expanded their price. We've passed the price index to Monster products. And -- we still see it as an opportunity. The extent is not that significant. We still will retain a very competitive price for consumers. . Both within the energy category and the ready-to-drink beverages as a whole. And we've discussed it with most of our major distributors and customers. And we've absorbed significant increases. As you know, we had one increase in the last 2 years. And our competitors in the ready-to-drink beverage space have had multiple. So we still see it as an opportunity. And we think it is something that we should pursue and move forward with.
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS.
Peter Grom: Thanks, operator. Good afternoon, everyone. So I was hoping to get some just some thoughts on the quarter-to-date trends, just when backing out the benefits from selling days, it doesn't imply a ton of growth on an underlying basis, if at all. So can you maybe just talk about category trends in July maybe unpack it from a U.S. versus international perspective? And just going back to Dara's question, just any thoughts in terms of how you see growth kind of progressing from here through the balance of the quarter?
Rodney Sacks: We look at Nielsen like the rest of the group. And you can really see Nielsen if -- you look at U.S. convenience and you look at all measured channels, that the situation is actually getting worse in July, and it's not getting better. So we've always spoken about our nonmeasured channels and our nonmeasured channels have continued to be a significant part of our activities and continue to grow. But looking at the Nielsen numbers, and I'm sure you've seen that, Peter, the July numbers are -- so it's not a dramatic, but it is a worsening trend.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs.
Bonnie Herzog: I thought...
Rodney Sacks: Bonnie, we haven't thought to come on this call, we've been waiting for you.
Bonnie Herzog: Well, you didn't pick me early enough. I've been here waiting. So I did want to...
Rodney Sacks: We don't see the picking unfortunately.
Bonnie Herzog: Yes. Okay. Well, I did want to circle back, of course, slowdown that you guys did report in the quarter versus your expectations. I guess I am still trying to reconcile a few things. Could you maybe help us understand where bottler inventory levels are? I mean, is there any timing impact by chance, especially internationally that might have impacted Q2? And then second, maybe help us understand your innovation pipeline. I know you talked about a lot, but any shipment timing impact that you saw with the rollout of innovation, whether it was in Q1 or in Q2? And then how do we think about the second half? Do you possibly have more innovation rolling out in the back half versus what you did in the first half?
Rodney Sacks: Well, let me talk about -- answer your first question, Rodney will talk about innovation. We haven't heard of any bottle inventories that are challenged or have changed significantly this card. We are in summer -- and we haven't heard anything. I know and I read, obviously, one of the competitors mentioned that they had bought the inventory issues -- but we have not seen that. The only thing we spoke about is this German issue for 1 million cases, which has been rectified.
Hilton Schlosberg: But I think we always every quarter, we have choppy issues with bottlers because -- as we said earlier in the quarter, it depends on when they produce and sometimes they may be producing just before or at the end of the period. That does have some effect. But again, we've not really looked and gone into it because it's really -- it's just part of the way our business is done, and we just got to live with it. And so we haven't called it out specifically, but these things do continue to occur.
Rodney Sacks: If we hear something significant. Obviously, we call it out, but we haven't [indiscernible].
Hilton Schlosberg: Now with regard to innovation, innovation has been fine. We've had 2 good products -- the fantasy Ruby Red has done very well, and we've got out a little later with the Rio funds. They've both done very well. If I look at the sales point of those 2 items are pretty strong they're ahead of sales per point of competitive new product launches like Red Bull, their sugar-free this year. In fact, the sales per point of those 2 new items that we launched are actually ahead of South per point of the very top Celsius sort of SKU. So I'll just give you some sort of perspective. One of the perhaps challenges this year was perhaps a little lower than others. If you look at our the distribution levels we achieved on the innovation, they're perhaps a little lower. They've been in the 60s -- but 60s and perhaps we think that in a perfect world, that should have been closer to 75% or 80%. So that's something we are addressing with our bodily partners and with the industry. And obviously, I think we could probably improve on that. But that is probably one of the issues that perhaps didn't deliver as much in dollars on the innovation as One of the reasons that the innovation was maybe a little lower. But ultimately, the innovation has done -- is still doing pretty well when I look at even the latest weekly figures. Also, we do have this planned innovation. We have really a large company focus on the launch of Ultra Vice Guava. We think it's a really exciting, it's a really -- it's a great package. It's a great flavor. But we are, in fact, galvanizing our own team and the partners -- and we're going to go out and have a -- we believe, a real good launch of this product towards the end of this year, in the end of the third quarter, beginning of the fourth quarter. So we see that as being really positive -- and I think that give us something to execute against. We also got some good innovation coming in next year and -- but that will start shipping at the end of this year, part of it and some of it at the end of January. And we've got a good plan going through for spring of 2025. So we remain encouraged by our innovation. In fact, one of the other innovation items we launched was Zero Sugar in EMEA, which has done really nicely. We also launched Juice bad apple which we hadn't launched in the U.S., and that has been rolled out, and that is also getting some really good reception. So that is something that we'll be looking at to maybe expanding in other areas, but we went -- we tested it first in EMEA. So we do have some pipeline coming or newer products. So we are positive going forward that we'll be able to address consumer trends and look at the industry will be positive going forward.
Rodney Sacks: And one other thing I just wanted to mention, Bonnie, was that if you look at 2023, remember, we launched Zero Sugar, which was the analog to Monster Green. And that was a very, very significant launch. So when you compare '24 to '23, Zero Sugar was really a major push as indeed with Strawberry Dreams, great flavors. So was really incredible with regard to launches. 2024 was great, but obviously not at the same level as '23.
Hilton Schlosberg: We'll also just as a matter of interest, we've got some great innovation. We're looking to launch for Bang because that's been a new brand to our portfolio. We have our own sort of innovation launch for early next year. And we have another launch in conjunction with all means possible. And their social media response and presence on their channels and for the brand has been, we are seeing some really positive signs. So we are sort of quite positive about also being able to take Bang into start to sort of start to get that brand more focused with new innovation now, which we haven't had until now. We'll be consolidating and just getting relistings.
Operator: And our next question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi.
Filippo Falorni: I wanted to ask about gross margins. You mentioned in the release that you were 50 basis points below the first quarter because of higher allowances that you think are nonrecurring and some production efficiencies. Should we think those go away starting in Q3? And then maybe you can talk about the commodity environment. It seems aluminum is still favorable year-over-year -- is it going to be still favorable in the balance of the year? Just any color on the commodity environment as well?
Rodney Sacks: Let me talk a little bit about what you're referring to -- and yes, indeed, we do believe that these -- the high allowances and the production inefficiencies will take care of themselves. I'm not sure where the the production inefficiencies will take care of itself in the third quarter, but certainly, it will over time. The production inefficiencies relate to the 2 plants that we have up and running. We opened Norwalk for production in April, and we're gearing up production in NOC, which is one of the reasons for the production inefficiencies because we're gearing up that plant to full production. And then on the other hand, we have our facility in Phoenix that we acquired as part of the bank transaction, which is at present, only producing bank products. But we're gearing it up to produce Monster both the Ultra versions of Monster and Reign, which are the nonsugar varieties and then ultimately, the sugar varieties because they don't have -- they don't have sugar tanks. And we've had issues with water that we've been dealing with to ensure that we deliver the best Monster flavors possible. So that's where the production inefficiencies are coming from, and they will resolve themselves over time. The alliances absolutely will resolve themselves, we believe, in the -- this next quarter, they should be gone. So that's where we are on that. Now in the -- on the commodities environment, we hedge aluminum. So how we hedge aluminum is we use the ladder. So we purchased aluminum according to a prescribed formula and we have certain amounts at our discretionary reevaluate aluminum on a weekly basis. So -- and we take advantage, of course, of pricing when pricing falls but there are instances where we may have purchased aluminum at higher prices to ensure that our latter strategy is properly executed because there was a time in aluminum, as you know, was up -- and everyone is going to purchase aluminum and now it's back down -- so it's a -- they're plus and minuses. But I do believe that we're in good territory with aluminum and aluminum, we should be able to see reductions over time.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, at this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Rodney Sacks for closing remarks.
Rodney Sacks: Thanks. On behalf of the company, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continue to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad and in particular, capitalizing on our relationship with the Coca-Cola bottling system. We believe that we're well positioned in the beverage industry and continue to be optimistic about the future of the company. We hope that you remain safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-02 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Company First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would like now to turn the conference over to CEO, Rodney Sacks and Hilton Schlosberg. Please go ahead. 
Rodney Sacks: Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, is on the call; as is Tom Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom Kelly will now read our cautionary statement.

The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  
 I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks. 
Rodney Sacks: Thank you, Tom. The company achieved record first quarter net sales of $1.9 billion in the 2024 first quarter, 11.8% higher than net sales of $1.7 billion in the 2023 comparable period and 15.6% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis, 12.6% exclusive of Argentina's impact. 
 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 first quarter was 54.1%, compared with 52.8% in the comparative 2023 first quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2024 first quarter as compared to the 2023 first quarter was primarily the result of decreased freight-in costs, pricing actions in certain markets and lower input costs, partially offset by geographical sales mix.  
 Operating expenses for the 2024 first quarter were $485.1 million compared with $412.8 million in the 2023 first quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2024 first quarter were 25.5%, compared with 24.3% in the 2023 first quarter. The increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of increased storage and warehouse, increased marketing expenses, increased sponsorship and endorsement and social media expenses as well as increased payroll expenses. 
 Distribution expenses for the 2024 first quarter were $94.4 million, or 5% of net sales compared to $76.3 million or 4.5% of net sales in the 2023 first quarter.  
 Operating income for the 2024 first quarter increased 11.7% to $542 million from $485.1 million in the 2023 comparative quarter. The effective tax rate for the 2024 first quarter was 23.5%, compared with 20.1% in the 2023 first quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a decrease in the stock-based compensation deduction in the 2024 first quarter as compared to the 2023 first quarter.  
 Net income increased 11.2% to $442 million as compared to $397.4 million in the 2023 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2024 first quarter increased 12% to $0.42 from $0.38 in the first quarter of 2023. 
 The company implemented price increases in the first quarter of 2024 in certain international markets, including highly inflationary markets. We are continuing to monitor opportunities for further pricing actions in both the United States and internationally. The company continues to have market share leadership in the energy drink category for all outlets combined in the United States in both the 13-week and 4-week periods ended April 20, 2024. 
 According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through April 20, 2024, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 3.8% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of the company's energy brands, excluding Bang, were up 0.1% in the 13-week period. Sales of Monster declined 1.4%, sales of Reign were up 16.1%, Sales of NOS increased 4.9% and sales of Full Throttle increased 1.7%. Sales of Red Bull increased 3.6%. 
 According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April 20, 2024, sales in dollars in the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased 1% over the same period the previous year. Sales of the company's energy brands, excluding Bang, decreased 2.1% in the 4-week period in the convenience and gas channel. Sales of Monster decreased by 3.3% over the same period versus the previous year. Reign sales increased 5.3%, NOS was up 4.5% and Full Throttle was down 0.6%. Sales of Red Bull were up 2.1%. 
 According to Nielsen,  for the 4 weeks ended April 20, 2024, the company's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, decreased from 36.8% to 35.7% and excluding Bang. Including Bang, the company's market share is 37.3%. Monster share decreased from 30.6% a year ago to 29.3%. Reign's share increased 0.1 of a share point to 3.1%. NOS' share increased 0.1 of a share point to 2.6% and Full Throttle share remained at 0.7%. Bang share was 1.6%. Red Bull share increased 0.4 of a share point to 34.6%. Market share of certain competitors were as follows: CELSIUS 8.5%, C4 3.7%, 5-Hour 3.3%; Rockstar 3% and GHOST 3%. 
 According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April 20, 2024, sales in dollars in the coffee plus energy drink category, which includes our Java Monster line, in the convenience and gas channel decreased 10.7% over the same period the previous year. Sales of Java Monster, including Java Monster 300 and Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew were 3.6% lower in the same period versus the previous year. Sales of Starbucks Energy were 19.5% lower. Java Monster share of the coffee plus energy drink category for the 4 weeks ended April 20, 2024, was 59.5%, up 4.4 points, while Starbucks Energy share was down 40.1% -- down to 40.1%, down 4.4 points. 
 According to Nielsen, in all measured channels in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended March 23, 2024, the energy drink category increased 10.2% in dollars. Sales of the company's energy drink brands increased 2.9% versus a year ago. The market share of the company's energy drink brands decreased 2.8 points to 40.3%. Monster sales increased 4.2% and its market share decreased 2.1 points to 36.5%. NOS' sales decreased 6.9% and its market share decreased 0.2 points to 1.1%. Full Throttle sales increased 22.2% and its market share remained at 0.5%. 
 According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category increased 23.1% for the month of March 2024. Monster sales increased 20.2%. Monster's market share in value decreased 0.7 of a point to 29.3% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Predator increased 28.6% and its market share increased 0.2 share points to 5.9%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover a single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.  
 According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined,  in Brazil, the energy drink category increased 15.7% for the month of March 2024. Monster sales increased 26.7%. Monster's market share in value increased 4.2 points to 48.1% compared to March 2023. In Argentina, due in part to the impact of inflation-related local currency price increases, the energy drink category increased 265.9% for the month of March 2024. Monster sales increased 300.2%. The Monster's market share in value increased 5 points to 58.5% compared to March 2023.  
 In Chile, the energy drink category decreased 8.4% for the month of March 2024. Monster sales decreased 7.8%. Monster's market share in value increased 0.3 points to 42.9%. Monster Energy remains the leading energy brand in value in Argentina, Brazil and Chile. 
 I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country. 
 According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until the end of March 2024, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 15.5% to 16.2% in Belgium; from 32.8% to 34.2% in France; from 30.8% to 33.1% in Great Britain; from 4.7% to 6.6% in the Netherlands; from 28.3% to 30.3% in the Republic of Ireland; and from 39.9% to 41.3% in Spain.

 Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $744.1 million, 39.2% of total net sales in the 2024 first quarter compared to $622.9 million or 36.7% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2023.

 In EMEA, net sales for the 2024 first quarter increased 28.2% in dollars and increased 32% on a currency-neutral basis over the same period in 2023.

We continued with the expanded distribution of the Beast Unleased during the first quarter of 2024, which is now available in 49 states through a network of beer distributors and will be in all 50 states by the end of summer. We have commenced with the rollout of the Beast Unleashed in 24-ounce single-serve cans and are seeing early success while maintaining the base of 16-ounce single-serve cans that were launched last year. We are pleased with the results of the Beast Unleashed and are continuing to expand points of distribution of this brand. 
 Nasty Beast, our new Hard Tea line was launched in 12-ounce variety packs in January 2024, and  in 24-ounce single-serve cans in February 2024 and is now available in 49 states. Early response to the brand has been positive, and we are continuing to focus heavily on expansion of distribution.

Additional launches are planned throughout EMEA in 2024.  
 During the first quarter of 2024, we launched Monster Ultra Violet in Japan, Monster Ultra Peachy Keen in Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, and Monster Pipeline Punch in China. 
 During the quarter, we also introduced Predator Gold Strike in the Philippines and Azerbaijan. Last month, we launched a noncarbonated Predator Gold Strike in a 500 ml PET bottle in selected provinces in China. Initial acceptance from retailers and consumers has been positive. 
 During the 2024 first quarter, the company purchased approximately 1.8 million shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $54.96 per share, for a total amount of $97.2 million, excluding broker commissions. As of May 2, 2024, approximately $642.4 million remained available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase programs. 
 The company intends to commence a modified Dutch Auction tender offer for up to $3 billion in value of shares of its common stock, subject to market conditions at a specified price range that is yet to be determined. The company believes that the tender offer represents an efficient mechanism to permit shareholders the opportunity to obtain liquidity without the potential disruption that can result from market sales. 
 The Company expects to fund the tender offer with approximately $2 billion of cash on hand and approximately $1 billion in combined borrowings, consisting of a new revolving credit facility and a new delayed draw term loan facility, each expected to be consummated prior to the completion of the tender offer. The tender offer will be made outside of the Company's previously authorized repurchase programs and will allow the Company to retain the ability to purchase additional shares through the previously authorized repurchase programs in the future. The Company's co-CEOs, namely Hilton and myself, have indicated that we intend to participate in the offer for investment diversification and estate planning purposes. My participation in particular, may provide me some flexibility to consider my own potential options, which may also help the Company continue succession planning for its next phase of leadership. 
 In this regard, after consultation with the Company's Board, I am considering reducing my day-to-day management responsibilities starting in 2025, while continuing to manage certain areas of the Company's business for which I have always been responsible. At that time, I intend to remain Chairman of the company's Board and Mr. Schlosberg would segue from Co-CEO to CEO.  
 We estimate that on a foreign currency adjusted basis, including the alcohol brand segment, April 2024 sales were approximately 12.9% higher than the comparable April 2023 sales and 14.9% higher than April 2023, excluding the alcohol brands segment. 
 Excluding Argentina's impact, we estimate that on a foreign currency adjusted basis, including the alcohol brand segment, April 2024 sales were approximately 11.5% higher than the comparable April sales and 13.5% higher than April 2023, excluding the alcohol brand segment. We estimate April 2024 sales, including the alcohol brands segment to be approximately 10% higher than in April 2023 and 11.9% higher than in April 2023, excluding the alcohol brand segment. April 2024, we had 2 more selling days compared to April 2023. 
 In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production. 
 In some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules. This affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintained inventory levels according to their own internal requirements which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.  
 In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. The energy category continues to grow globally. We are pleased to report that our pricing actions have not significantly impacted consumer demand. Our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a larger number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower landed costs to our EMEA region. We are in the process of constructing a juice facility at our AFF flavor facility in Ireland. 
 We have a robust innovation plan for 2024. Beast Unleashed is performing to expectations. We're excited for Nasty Beast Hard Tea as well as the additional alcohol opportunities that Monster Brewing Company presents. Initial acceptance from retailers and consumers has been positive. We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio in a number of markets internationally, including the launch last month of Predator in a noncarbonated formula in 500 ml PET bottles in selected provinces in China.  We are proceeding with plans for further launches of our affordable energy brands.  
 We are excited about the opportunities that the acquisition of the Bang Energy brand presents to us and believe that the brand will fit well within our broader portfolio of energy drink brands. 
 The company achieved record first quarter net sales of $1.9 billion in the 2024 first quarter, 11.8% higher than net sales of $1.7 billion in the 2023 comparable period and 15.6% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis, or 12.6% exclusive of our Argentina's impact. 
 I would now like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Filippo Falorni of Citi. 
Filippo Falorni: I just wanted to ask on the April number you just gave, I know 1 month of data is not indicative of your long-term results. But  just maybe clarify what's in there. Is the 2 extra day included in the number because that alone can get you to about 10 points of growth? And maybe any timing-related impacts that impacted the number compared to like what you just reported in Q4? That would be helpful. 
Unknown Executive: So the 2 extra days in April were obviously included in the numbers that we reported for April sales. The second part of your question, I actually didn't really understand. So maybe you can repeat it. 
Filippo Falorni: Sure. I was just curious, like, is there any impact in terms of shipment timing to the bottlers, considering the trend that we've seen in Q4, it seems a material deceleration. So wondering whether is there any timing impact in that number, in the April number? 
Unknown Executive: Yes. So we've always spoken in our business about the fact that we sell to the bottlers. And in some cases, the bottlers particularly internationally in manufactured products for us, which we purchase from the bottlers and then sell to them as part of the distribution arrangements. And oftentimes, they determine when they want to produce. So we expect them to produce on such and such a day and such and such a month, they may produce in a subsequent month or they may produce earlier. So when we talk about ourselves, remember, there are sales to the bottlers, they are not sales to -- we do some business at direct to customers, but most of our sales are done to the bottlers. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. 
Andrea Teixeira: I was hoping if you can talk a bit about how we should be thinking of the consumer, in particular in the U.S.? We have been hearing a lot of your peers talk about a softening and how we should be thinking of in the context of pricing that you potentially alluded, some of your competitors have taken pricing. You decided to stay put at this point. Anything you can add and how it relates to aluminum going up on the spot price? 
Unknown Executive: This is a repeated question from you, and thanks for raising it again. As you know, we have a very strong brand. The brand is an affordable luxury. And it's strategic for us to orchestrate when and if we'll take price. So I think we've done a lot of evaluation on what makes sense and what makes sense to the brand, as we said we would. And in principle, we have really worked hard at really coming to a decision that a pricing opportunity is out there. And we -- I'm not saying how much it's going to be. It's going to be later this year, but we will be announcing to bottlers and retailers sometime in the next few months because there's -- as you know, there's a 30- to 60-day -- mainly 60 days for implementation of a price increase, but we expect it to happen in the fourth quarter. 
Operator: The next question comes from Peter Grom of UBS. 
Peter Grom: Rodney and Hilton, I know no changes for some time, but congrats on kind of the new roles to come. I guess I just wanted to ask about the Dutch Auction announced today. Just kind of -- just would love some perspective on the decision process? Why now? Why using debt? Is this a change in terms of how you're thinking about the balance sheet in longer term? Or is this just kind of a short-term dynamic? And lastly, I'm not sure if I missed this, but did you provide any color on timing as it relates to this? 
Rodney Sacks: I think that it's a question of timing. I think that given the recent softness in the market, we believe that it is an opportunistic time to execute an at-scale transaction of this nature. We believe that this structure gives the company the opportunity to repurchase a greater number of shares and do so more quickly than we could under the programs, which we've implemented, as you know, over the -- quarter by quarter, we've continually strategically bought stock back. We think that is a good use of our cash. Obviously, we look at acquisitions from time to time, but we have a lot of excess cash. .
 And if you remember, we did a similar modified Dutch Auction in 2016 that we thought was very successful. It enabled the company to buy back shares, and we moved on. So we think the timing is right. We think that we'll probably implement it shortly in the next week or so. We'll come out with the documentation and the formal announcement. So it will be in this quarter. We also want to make the point that the tender offer is going to be in addition to our existing plans, which will remain in place. And that will also continue to give us opportunity to, again, to continue to buy additional shares as and when opportunistically, we think we should. 
Operator: The next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. 
Christopher Carey: Just a follow-up on the pricing announcement in Q4. Just is that on the entire U.S. portfolio? Is that the plan? And then just the question would be, I think this is the best international gross margin in several years. And so is there anything structurally occurring in your international margin structure? Or is this just maybe just easing commodities, easing import, cost easing. So basic question, is this just more cyclical in commodities? Or is there something else going on within your international gross margins? 
Unknown Executive: So referring to your first question. And you asked a question about gross margins and we -- and if you look at this quarter, we had a pickup, obviously, in international margins which we've been working on for some time, particularly in EMEA. And we also had a pickup in U.S. margins. So we've been working on improving margins across the board. You'll remember that I spoke in the first -- in the fourth quarter, when we had our final year results, and I said that our gross margin then had a few nonrecurring items in basically true-ups and rebate programs that were recognized in that fourth quarter. And I said that on an ongoing basis, on a stand-alone basis, we expected margins to be at the about the 53.5% level. Well, we did better than that. And it's something we've been working on and we'll continue to work on in trying to improve gross margins. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs. 
Bonnie Herzog: Congratulations to you both, I guess, pending Rodney's decision. I had a question on your U.S. sales growth in the quarter, which was, I guess, a decent step down. It sounds like your business is maybe slowing month-to-month during the quarter and then a little bit in April. So could you touch on what's driving the slowdown and really for the entire category. I guess I'm also curious about this in light of your robust innovation pipeline and I think shelf-space gains. And then you mentioned that you continue to grow your sales in non-Nielsen measured channels. So first, could you just maybe clarify how your sales are performing on your end in the measured channels. And then could you give us a sense of what percentage of your business is now in nonmeasured channels, I guess, in the U.S.? 
Unknown Executive: So Bonnie, we don't report what percentage of our sales is done in the nonmeasured channels. So it's hard for me to give an answer to that since we don't report it, but it's something we can consider doing in the future. But our nonmeasured channels remain strong. And as you know, we have a bunch of really important customers in that category, including FSOP, Foodservice On-Premise. We have one of the big club store chains is in that nonmeasured channel. We have Home Depot, Lowe's, Amazon. So we do have a bunch of customers that operate in those nonmeasured channels. And you can see the discrepancy between the Nielsen numbers and what we report as a company because, a, the Nielsen numbers are sales to consumers, we report on sales to bottlers and our direct customers, and we also include sales to our nonmeasured channels. 
 And then I just actually wanted to get back to a previous question where it was asked whether that price increase that we referred to would be across the whole portfolio. And when we look at the portfolio in the U.S. We have a number of different product lines. But the reference to the price increase will be on the main Monster Energy line, and possibly some of the others, but that also has not been clarified as of yet. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala of Jefferies. 
Kaumil Gajrawala: Can I try maybe following up on Bonnie's question a little bit more, at least from the data and stuff that we're seeing, it sounds like there is maybe more of a slowdown than perhaps what  you're seeing or how you're feeling about the category itself. And just if you could dig into, is that accurate? And if so, what do you think might be happening? 
Rodney Sacks: First talk a little bit -- there clearly has been a slight slowdown. I mean I think that you guys have followed a lot of the consumer product companies both beverage and non-beverage. And I think that there is -- including a lot of the convenience chains we report as well. And I think there has been a report generally across the board, there is some slowdown. I think you've got to take into account that last year, there was a lot of acceleration. There were increased sales, so you're looking at it on a 2-year basis as well. But there is some softness. We think that inflation and higher gas prices are having an effect on the number of consumers that are going into the stores and traveling. 
 And so I think that is something I think we're sort of industry-wide are experiencing. We think that things will pick up. We think that summer is coming, but that has been something you've noticed and you guys see that. You read the Nielsen's as we do, but we also look to other channels to look at increased sales. And through the other channel business, we have continued to have healthy sales. And obviously, we are introducing a lot of innovation that's getting listings now. So we are looking positive to how that will implement our sales going forward. 
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Lavery of Piper Sandler. 
Michael Lavery: Can you just give us an update on Bang and just some of your thinking on how it's progressing and specifically maybe some of the marketing activation or distribution momentum and what we might expect for plans for the rest of the year? 
Unknown Executive: So if you look at Bang and look at the latest 4 weeks, you'll see that sales are starting to accelerate. And mainly because we've been able to get listings as we move through to this season of listings in the chains. As you know, the brand was discontinued for a number of reasons last year. And it's been a real impetus to get the brand up and running. We believe it has, and we believe it's moving positively. The marketing for the brand is -- has really been a low ebb and it's gaining momentum as we move into the summer. We're in the process of accelerating, and I'm going to be careful what I say, but a large influencer platform to help move and accelerate the brand. So the marketing is underway. It's just taking a little bit of time to get it up and moving. As I said earlier -- or I said in previous calls, it's positioned as a lifestyle brand. And we believe that too -- we have to invest in the market, we accept that and to achieve the positioning that we're looking for. 
Operator: The next question comes from Peter Galbo from Bank of America. 
Peter Galbo: Maybe I just actually wanted to ask not on the gross margin line, but on some of the operating expense lines. I mean there's been quite a sizable build, I think, in some of those numbers and certainly ahead of, I think, what the Street had. I'm just curious, is there any timing shift there? Or is there any build in terms of the, I don't know, distribution expense ahead of either shelf resets or Bang rolling out more significantly? Just kind of want to understand how you're thinking about that going forward. 
Unknown Executive: Well, on the one hand, we took a conscious decision to build up inventories. So in doing so, we really had this objective of satisfying demand, which we really did not do very well at in previous years. So we have significant inventories now, and we -- our in-stock rates are climbing in the 95-plus percent levels. So we're able to service much better, but obviously, there's a cost to it. And freight, as you know, has gone up. And -- so that's one factor. Warehousing has gone up. So that's one factor in the -- in our operating expenses. There's nothing that's really that's tied to any particular period. These are all expenses that were incurred within the quarter and they reported as being in the quarter. 
 Sponsorships are up, payroll is up. So there's a bunch of -- and you'll see it in -- more effectively in the Q, the number of cost items that are up. And as before, we do maintain a huge objective to get costs down. So these increases do not get unnoticed. But unfortunately, they're part of doing business in the world in which we're living, and we have competitors. And we have to negotiate for the best marketing dollars that we can. 
Rodney Sacks: The only thing I would add is that when you look at the costs, and we've had increases in sponsorship and marketing and social media, those probably are the biggest cost increases. But we are diverting or focusing a little more on the social media platforms because of the full array of our brands that are more aligned to social media consumers. Those are going to take effect and we have these programs being put in place, and we're obviously expensing those costs as we incur. But I think some of the benefits will start -- we're hoping we'll start seeing them in the second and third quarter as we go into summer, and those programs become more, more active. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. 
Mark Astrachan: I wanted to ask who's going to be reading all of the country market share numbers, Rodney, when you transition to the full Chairman role, just kidding. 
Unknown Executive: Need Rodney to do that. 
Mark Astrachan: Seriously, I wanted to ask about international gross margins. Just curious how you think about the ability to potentially improve those in negotiating specifically better economics with the Coke system is Monster's importance to the system and to their revenue and profitability increases. And I guess maybe thinking about it broadly, right, a lot of these agreements were struck 9 years ago. So 10-year anniversary next year. I know some are up for renewal then. What about on a go-forward basis? And sort of how do you think about those discussions with the system? 
Unknown Executive: Yes, Mark, thanks for that question. I want to put you in that position. It's dealing with the bottlers and you've got a lot of experience, I know in talking to them, but that's really a tough egg to crack. So we have to do it in different ways. We've got to look at commodities. We have to look at it in terms of pricing. And we've got to look at it in a very judicious manner with the bottling community. We have a great business going and we've got to be very careful not to jeopardize the motivation behind the brands. 
Operator: The next question comes from Peter Grom of UBS. 
Peter Grom: I guess just on the price increase, just the question I've gotten a few times. Is there anything you can share in terms of the magnitude of the U.S. fourth quarter price increase? 
Unknown Executive: Peter, it's really difficult because we've come to an assessment, and before we go out to our bottlers and our retailers, it would be -- it would not be appropriate for me to talk about that at this stage. 
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Sacks for any closing remarks. 
Rodney Sacks: Thanks. Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continue to innovate, to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad, and in particular, capitalizing on our relationship with the Coca-Cola Bottling System. We believe that we are well positioned in the beverage industry and continue to be optimistic about the future of the company. We hope that you remain safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your attendance. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-28 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Company Fourth Quarter 2023 Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rodney Sacks and Hilton Schlosberg, Co-CEOs. Please go ahead.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thanks for attending this call. I am Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer is on the call; as is Tom Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom Kelly will now read our cautionary statement.
Tom Kelly: Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2023 and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Before I turn the call over to Rodney Sacks, I would like to mention a clerical error that we had with the filing of our most recent press release that was filed just within the last half hour. And under the income statement session, under the 3 months ended December 31, 2023 the amount that was reported as gross profit which was reported as $983,372,000 should have been $938,372,000. Aside from that clerical error all other numbers on the press release are correct. I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you, Tom. The company achieved record fourth quarter net sales of $1.73 billion in the 2023 fourth quarter, 14.4% higher than net sales of $1.51 billion in the 2022 comparable period and 16.1% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 fourth quarter was 54.2% compared to 51.8% in the comparative 2022 fourth quarter. As a result of the Bang Inventory Step-Up, gross profit was adversely impacted by approximately $5 million during the 2023 fourth quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 54.5% for the 2023 fourth quarter, excluding the Bang Inventory Step-Up. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 fourth quarter as compared to the 2022 fourth quarter was primarily the result of pricing actions, decreased freight-in costs and lower input costs. During this call, we will talk about impairment charges of approximately $39.9 million recorded in the 2023 fourth quarter related to the Alcohol Brands segment due in part to the continuing challenges in the craft beer and seltzer categories. We will refer to these charges as the alcohol impairment charges. The alcohol impairment charges related to certain non-amortizing intangibles as well as property and equipment acquired as part of the CANarchy transaction. Operating expenses for the 2023 fourth quarter were $504.4 million compared to $390 million in the 2022 fourth quarter. Operating expenses for the 2023 fourth quarter included the alcohol impairment charges. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2023 fourth quarter were 29.2% compared with 25.8% in the 2022 fourth quarter. Exclusive of the alcohol impairment charges as a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2023 fourth quarter were 26.8%. Distribution expenses for the 2023 fourth quarter were $79.6 million or 4.6% of net sales compared to $76.1 million or 5% of net sales in the 2022 fourth quarter. Operating income for the 2023 fourth quarter increased 10% to $434 million from $394.4 million in the 2022 comparative quarter. Operational income adjusted for the Bang Inventory Step-Up and the alcohol impairment charges increased 21.4% to $478.9 million for the 2023 fourth quarter. The effective tax rate for the 2023 fourth quarter was 18.5% compared with 23.3% in the 2022 fourth quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to an increase in the stock compensation deduction. Net income increased 21.6% to $367 million as compared to $301.7 million in the 2022 comparable quarter. Net income adjusted for the Bang Inventory Step-Up and the alcohol impairment charges, net of tax, increased 33.1% to $401.5 million for the 2023 fourth quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2023 fourth quarter increased 22.3% to $0.35 from $0.29 in the fourth quarter of 2022. Diluted earnings per share adjusted for the Bang Inventory Step-Up and the alcohol impairment charges, net of tax, was $0.38 for the 2023 fourth quarter, an increase of 33.8%. The company has implemented price increases in the first quarter of 2024 in certain international markets. We are continuing to monitor opportunities for further pricing actions in both the United States and internationally. The company continues to have market share leadership in the energy drink category for all outlets combined in the United States in both the 13-week and 4-week periods ended February 17, 2024. According to Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through February 17, 2024, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 5.5% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of the company's energy brands, excluding Bang, were up 0.9% in the 13-week period. Sales of Monster declined 0.7%. Sales of Reign were up 21.6%. Sales of NOS increased 5.1%. And sales of Full Throttle increased 3.6%. Sales of Red Bull increased 2.9%. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended February 17, 2024, sales in dollars in the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased 3.7% over the same period the previous year. Sales of the company's energy brands, excluding Bang, decreased 0.1% in the 4-week period in the convenience and gas channel. Sales of Monster decreased by 2% over the same period versus the previous year. Reign sales increased 17.2%. NOS sales were up 6%, and Full Throttle was up 1.7%. Sales of Red Bull were up 3.8%. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended February 17, 2024, the company's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, decreased from 36.9% to 35.5%, excluding Bang. Including Bang, the company's market share is 37%. Monster share decreased from 30.8% a year ago to 29.1%. Reign's share increased 0.3 of a share points to 3%. NOS share increased 0.1 of a share point to 2.7%, and Full Throttle share remained at 0.7%. Bang share was 1.4%. Red Bull share increased 0.1 of a share point to 35.1%. Market share of certain competitors were as follows: CELSIUS 8.1%, C4 3.5%, 5-Hour 3.4%, Rockstar 3.2%, and GHOST 2.9%. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended February 17, 2024, sales in dollars of the coffee plus energy drink category, which includes our Java Monster line, in the convenience and gas channel, decreased 10.3% over the same period the previous year. Sales of Java Monster, including Java Monster 300 and Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew were 4.6% lower in the same period versus the previous year. Sales of Starbucks Energy were 16.9% lower. Java Monster share of the coffee plus energy drink category for the 4 weeks ended February 17, 2024, was 58.2%, up 3.5 points, while Starbucks Energy share was 41.5%, down 3.3 points. According to Nielsen, in all measured channels in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended January 27, 2024, the energy drink category increased 9.2% in dollars. Sales of the company's energy drink brands increased 8.6% versus a year ago. The market share of the company's energy drink brands decreased 0.2 of a point to 41.3%. Monster's sales increased 9%, and its market share decreased 0.1 of a point to 37.3%. NOS sales decreased 5.1% and its market share decreased 0.2 of a point to 1.2%. Full Throttle sales increased 24.6%, and its market share increased 0.1 of a point to 0.6%. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category increased 10.9% for the month of January 2024. Monster sales increased 10.5%. Monster's market share in value decreased 0.1 of a point to 29.4% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Predator increased 23.2%, and its market share increased 0.6 of a share point to 5.6%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover a single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined, in Brazil, the energy drink category increased 19.9% for the month of January 2024. Monster sales increased 33.6%. Monster's market share in value increased 4.7 points to 45.8% compared to January 2023. In Argentina, due in part to hyperinflation, the energy drink category increased 167.2% for the month of January 2024. Monster sales increased 178.2%. Monster's market share in value increased 2.2 points to 55.8% compared to January 2023. In Chile, the energy drink category increased 1.8% for the month of January 2024. Monster sales decreased 2.2%. Monster's market share in value decreased 1.7 points to 40.5%. Monster Energy remains the leading energy brand in value in Argentina, Brazil and Chile. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until the end of January 2024, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 14.9% to 16.3% in Belgium; from 31% to 31.6% in France; from 30.8% to 33.2% in Great Britain; from 4.9% to 6.2% in the Netherlands; from 32.7% to 34.4% in Norway; and from 40.5% to 40.9% in Spain.

Monster's market share in value increased 2.9 points to 19.4% against the comparable period the previous year.

Monster's market share in value decreased 5.9 points to 53.6% against the comparable period the previous year. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or 4-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $637 million, 36.8% of total net sales in the 2023 fourth quarter compared to $542.5 million or 35.9% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2022. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on net sales in the U.S. -- in U.S. dollars by approximately $27.1 million in the 2023 fourth quarter. In EMEA, net sales in the 2023 fourth quarter increased 10.4% in dollars, and increased 11.1% on a currency-neutral basis over the same period in 2022. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the fourth quarter was 32.7% compared to 33.9% in the same quarter in 2022 and 31.1% in the 2023 third quarter. We are also pleased that in the 2023 fourth quarter, Monster gained market share in Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, the Republic of Ireland and Spain.

During the first quarter of 2024, we announced that CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective, or what we referred to as CANarchy, will operate under the name Monster Brewing Company. This change will better align the business with our brand equity. We continue with the expanded distribution of The Beast Unleashed during the fourth quarter of 2023, which are now available in 48 states through a network of beer distributors. We have commenced with the rollout of The Beast Unleashed in 24-ounce single-serve cans in the convenience and gas channel.

In the U.S., during the 2023 fourth quarter, we expanded NOS Original with a zero sugar offering, NOS Zero Sugar. Our pipeline innovation continues in the first quarter of 2024. In January, we launched 2 additional flavors of Reign Storm, Guava Strawberry and Citrus Zest to add to the 4 flavors already in distribution. We are planning to launch 2 additional Reign Storm flavors, Apricot Strawberry and Mango in March 2024, bringing the total number of Reign Storm flavors to 8. In February, we launched Monster Energy Ultra Fantasy Ruby Red in 16-ounce and 12-ounce sleek cans. We also launched Monster Rehab Green Tea, Reign Total Body Fuel Sour Gummy Worm, Monster Juice Rio Punch, Java Monster Irish Cream and Monster Reserve Peaches and Cream. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2024, we continue to innovate in our multipack and variety pack offerings. In Canada, during the first quarter of 2024, we launched several new innovations. In January, we launched Monster Energy Ultra Strawberry Dreams in 2 package sizes as well as Reign Total Body Fuel Cherry Limeade and Monster Reserve Orange Dreamsicle. In early February 2024, we launched Monster Energy Zero Sugar in a 710 ml receivable package as well as Monster Rehab Wild Berry Tea. In Latin America, during the fourth quarter of 2023, we launched several new innovations. In Brazil, we launched Monster Pipeline Punch. In Uruguay, we launched Monster Ultra Sunrise. And in Chile, we launched Monster Aussie Style Lemonade. In Colombia and Guatemala, we launched Monster Reserve White Pineapple. In Peru, we launched Fury Gold Strike, an affordable energy brand. In Latin America, during the first quarter of 2024, several new flavors have been introduced. In Mexico, we continued to expand our affordable portfolio and introduced Predator Tropical. In the 2023 fourth quarter in New Zealand, we launched Monster Energy Ultra Peachy Keen. In Australia, during the first quarter of 2024, we launched Monster Energy Zero Sugar, Monster Energy Ultra Strawberry Dreams and Monster Juice Papillon. In EMEA, in the fourth quarter of 2023, we launched Monster Juice Monarch, Nitro Cosmic Peach, Reserve Orange Dreamsicle and Ultra Peachy Keen in a number of countries. Monster Energy Zero Sugar was launched in Great Britain, Ireland and Poland in the second half of 2023, with additional launches planned throughout EMEA in 2024. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we launched Monster Aussie Lemonade in Japan, Monster Ultra Paradise in Malaysia, Monster Mango Loco and Pipeline Punch in Kazakhstan and Monster Mango Loco in the Philippines. In February 2024, we introduced Predator Gold Strike in Azerbaijan and in the Philippines. During the 2023 fourth quarter, the company purchased approximately 0.8 million shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $54.57 per share, for a total amount of $43.2 million, excluding broker commissions. As of February 27, 2024, approximately $642.4 million remained available for purchase under the previously authorized repurchase program, that is dollars. We estimate on a foreign currency adjusted basis, including the Alcohol Brands segment, January 2024 sales were approximately 20.5% higher than the comparable period January 2023 sales, and 19.7% higher than January 2023, excluding the Alcohol Brands segment. We estimate January 2024 sales, including the Alcohol Brands segment to be approximately 17.8% higher than in January 2023 and 17% higher than in January 2023, excluding the Alcohol Brands segment. January 2024 had one more selling day compared to January 2023. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules. This affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintain inventory levels according to their own internal requirements, which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be in future to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, the energy category continues to grow globally. Two, we are pleased to report that our pricing actions have not significantly impacted consumer demand. Three, our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower landed costs to our EMEA region. We are in the process of constructing a juice facility at our AFF flavor facility in Ireland. We have a robust innovation plan for 2024. The Beast Unleashed is performing to expectations. We're excited for Nasty Beast Hard Tea as well as the additional alcohol opportunities that Monster Brewing Company presents. We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in a number of additional countries internationally. We are excited about the opportunities that the acquisition of the Bang Energy brand presents to us and believe that the brand will fit well within our broader portfolio of energy drink brands. And lastly, the company achieved record fourth quarter net sales of $1.73 billion in the 2023 fourth quarter, 14.4% higher than net sales of $1.51 billion in the 2022 comparable period and 16.1% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis. I would now like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the 2023 year. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Peter Grom with UBS. Please go ahead.
Peter Grom: Thanks, operator and good afternoon everyone. Hope you're doing well. So I wanted to ask a question specifically on gross margin. Clearly, the quarter came in a bit better relative to some of the commentary from the investor meeting. Maybe first, did something surprise you in the quarter? And then second, just going back to that same commentary from the investor meeting, there seem to be a lot of optimism that the gross margin trajectory would improve nicely from 4Q looking out to '24. I know you don't give guidance specifically, but just any thoughts on how we should think about the margin trajectory given the very strong exit rate? Thanks.
Hilton Schlosberg: So I think at the Investor Meeting, as I recall, we already spoke about 2023 Q4. As you know, we don't give guidance, and we really do try not to give guidance. So if I could just talk about Q4 for a minute, Q4 was strong. But there were a number of really nonrecurring items included in GP in Q4, mainly related to true-ups of various promotional items, various true-ups with partners as well as -- we have a few, we don't have very many, but we have a number of rebate programs. So looking at Q4 of 2023, I would say to you that on an ongoing basis, Q4 came up very much in line with what we expected, which was an increase over Q3. And it's at the level probably of about 53.5% on a kind of standalone basis excluding these nonrecurring items.
Operator: The next question is from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Please go ahead.
Filippo Falorni: Hey, good afternoon, guys. I wanted to ask you about the energy drink category in the U.S. We've seen a bit of a slowdown in January. How much do you think it was the weather? How much would you think we're some other external factor on the consumer? And then maybe you can comment a bit on market share trends in the U.S. We've seen a little bit of pressure on the core Monster brand. So any color you could give would be helpful.
Hilton Schlosberg: Yes. Firstly, I don't think one should discount the fact that the weather was a factor. Secondly, we do have a lot of non-measured channels. And if you heard earlier in the call, January sales were -- in my book, were really impressive, the increase in January sales. Added to that, Nielsen doesn't cover everything, as we've discussed before, and there were some interesting things in January, for example, one of the big club store chains had what we call an MVM, which is a club store chain that is not read by Nielsen, and in itself is pretty substantial. Adding to that, if you go back to January 2023, we had very robust increases mainly because of the launch of 2 brands that really hit it out of the park. One was Monster Zero Sugar and the other was Ultra Strawberry Dreams. On the call, you would have heard that innovation for 2024 has really kicked off in February and is going through February through to March, so we didn't have the benefit of that innovation program earlier on as we did in 2023. So these are all factors that one must take into account when one examines so-called slowness in the Nielsen volumes. Also, I might add that we have a number of important resets coming up, the trade reset from January on through the early part of the second quarter. So -- and we're anticipating big gains in shelf space not only for our legacy brands, not only for the SKUs that we are about to launch, but also for the Bang brand, where a number of retailers that had hitherto really discontinued Bang because of all the litigation and all of the issues are now taking it back, and we'll see that benefit starting really in the second quarter and -- sorry, starting in the first quarter and moving into the second quarter. So there's a whole number of factors that I think are worth bearing in mind when one looks at the Nielsens, for example, in January.
Operator: The next question is from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you, operator. Just you said that you continue to look at opportunities for pricing in the U.S. What is preventing you to announce pricing at this point? Do you see -- I mean, obviously, the key competitor announced pricing back when we all saw you here in New York, you were talking about potentially looking at the impact of elasticities. It seems that things have been moderately positive. Is there any reason why you'd wait? And then second, Hilton, when you spoke about a normalized gross profit margin of 53.5%. Should we expect margins to continue to build from here given that potentially the high 50s, it's still below where you were before the pandemic at 60. Is there any reason why these new plans would not leverage as fast or any structural reasons that you would be below the high 50s?
Hilton Schlosberg: No, the only structural reason is we don't give guidance. So that's the only structural reason I can think of. Obviously, we're working on margins. I'm proud to say that the Midwest premium and aluminum, which is one of [indiscernible] are coming down. But against that, we've said that we have increases in other commodities and other pricing. So we're bringing up our own manufacturing facilities up and we're doing whatever we can to improve gross profit percentages. But we don't give guidance and I don't know what's going to happen with freight, for example. We had a good benefit from freight-in this quarter -- this last quarter, and I'm not sure what's going to happen as we look forward into 2024 and the implications of the election and everything else. So that's about that. And then on pricing, we're taking pricing in a number of markets internationally. We've taken pricing in January in a number of markets. And we're moving through with an aggressive price increase program internationally. As regards to the U.S., we really are just -- we're waiting and evaluating. We run a very sizable business here. We have a number of customers that we deal with. And we want to make the right decision. So we're not saying no to a price increase, and we're not saying yes to a price increase this time. What we are saying is that we are honestly really evaluating and constantly evaluating the retail pricing environment. And if we believe there are opportunities, we will take them.
Operator: The next question is from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Dara Mohsenian: Hi, guys. Good afternoon. So the comments on some of the U.S. performance were helpful. Just given the strength of that global January number, can you spend some time discussing what you're seeing internationally in terms of category growth and your market share progression? And any thoughts on maybe key expansion plans internationally in terms of some of your key brands and how we should think about that for 2024? Thanks.
Hilton Schlosberg: So, Dara, on the call, we did talk about progress internationally in very great detail. I think sometimes we give far more detail than we should, but we do. We gave market shares in various countries we indicated the new product innovations that are going to happen through -- throughout our international territories, and I'm not sure what other question -- what part of your question, we possibly have an answer. And I don't mean to be disrespectful. I just feel that a lot of your question has been covered. Rodney, I don't know if you've got anything to add.
Rodney Sacks: No. Other than the -- there's -- if you look at the international markets, they've sort of been a little bit all over the place in many ways. But generally, they've been good. There was a little bit of slowing in Asia Pacific. We are taking steps to see some growth. But obviously, we are very substantial in those markets and the actual markets have been a little flatter. But we've got great opportunity in some of the international markets that are developing. We look particularly to markets like China and India. We're at the beginning of a growth phase in India, particularly focusing on not only Monster, but also Predator there. So I think that it is mixed. Some of the markets have had some sort of ups and downs, but overall, we're in growth in most of the markets, and we still see that as very exciting. And you can see from the results in January, we are still seeing -- despite the Nielsen numbers, we are still seeing good growth in the U.S. as well.
Operator: The next question is from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Steve Powers: Yes. Hey, good afternoon, guys. Two questions for me, if I could. The first one is just on G&A expenses in the quarter. They were up a lot relative to our expectations of almost 25% in the fourth quarter. Just anything to unpack there and anything anomalous in that number?
Hilton Schlosberg: Yes, we spoke about -- Steve, sorry to interrupt, but let's just answer the first. So remember, we spoke about impairment charges of $40 million in this quarter relating to the Alcohol Brands.
Steve Powers: Yes. Sorry, I'm excluding that. It's still up a lot, excluding the impairment charges.
Hilton Schlosberg: We'll look at that, but it's not what I've been seeing.
Steve Powers: Okay. The second question is, in January, you highlighted plans just to step up focus on in-market execution in the U.S., specifically commercialization around placing of the full portfolio and innovation. And just any update you can share on progress made and cooperation you're getting on the -- from the Coke system on that effort?
Hilton Schlosberg: Yes. I think that's not a one-fix issue. That's something that's ongoing, and we are working with the Coke bottlers to improve execution. As I said earlier, we are rolling out a number of new products and the new sets are all taking place in this first quarter from February onwards and early into the second quarter. And I think you'll see that -- well, I hope you'll see from those numbers when we report them, that the positioning should be somewhat different to where we are today.
Operator: The next question is from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Mark Astrachan: Yes. Hey, afternoon guys. I wanted to go back to international because I feel like it's one of those things that doesn't get the credit that's due, right? You built nearly a $3 billion run rate business at this point. And I think from the outside, it's a little bit hard to get a sense of kind of what's going on there. So not necessarily to Dara's question, but maybe talk to some of the dynamics in terms of number of SKUs that you have on shelf, not obviously by country, but sort of broader strokes of the opportunity you have to still develop your portfolio within those markets? How much opportunity is there broadly to develop the energy category? And sort of related to that, margins have improved, but they're obviously still a lot lower than your domestic margins, both gross margin and EBIT margin in that international business. How do you think about improving that over time? Is that possible relative to current levels? And kind of how do you think about the progression of that?
Hilton Schlosberg: We've always spoken about the fact that internationally, we compete very strongly against -- in the main Red Bull. And we really try and keep our pricing. We have a pricing strategy that's worked well for us, and that's really keeping within a particular percentage of Red Bull pricing. And the minute we stray from that, we find that our market shares really suffers. So we really have an interesting dynamic in that we have, obviously, relationships with The Coke partners. And we have a pricing structure that kind of has a ceiling, right? So it's -- while we are always on a mission to improve gross margins, and we do that on an ongoing basis, there are some areas where it is very difficult to get gross margin. And I've said this before, that I think it will be very difficult in the main to get gross margins internationally to the levels that we have enjoyed in the U.S. You can see what happened in EMEA. They nudged their margins up by 1% in the fourth quarter. And it's an ongoing battle to improve margins, bearing in mind the dynamics of what we are working against.
Operator: This concludes -- I'm sorry, go ahead, sir.
Rodney Sacks: Sorry, I just finish the other part of the question that Mark had raised just before we sign off. Just to talk about the international opportunity, I think what Mark is alluding to is correct. In many markets, the international markets have really followed the U.S. We have a far broader portfolio in the U.S. Innovation continues from year to year. But what -- the benefit that the international markets have is they see what we've introduced in the U.S. and the large number of additional SKUs and literally brand families we have in the U.S. And they're able to try and look to those and try and introduce selected SKUs, which gives them a very large runway. In some markets, the runway is focused on the Monster premium brands. And in some markets, the growth is coming from an affordable sector. And we have addressed that. So we have Monster in many markets, but we've also -- where we see that the premium sector has more of a limited percentage of the population that can really afford to have the buying power. We are growing, and that's where we're starting to grow brands like Predator in many international markets and that will help us continue to see growth and Predator also has a lot of depth. We were launching Predator in China this year. We've just launched Predator in India in cans. We are now just rolling out PET in India. We are trying to address some volume production issues because there's not a lot of availability, but that will sort itself out reasonably soon. And we see enormous opportunity once we get some availability for production in PET for PET in India. So there are a lot of opportunities, but they vary from market to market and continent to continent. As you know, we've just recently launch, for example, in Egypt, we launched both Monster and Predator. Predator's quickly made a name for itself as a growing brand. So we have these opportunities in different countries around the world. And so we're quite excited about seeing that. As I said, we did have some slowdown in some of the more developed countries in Asia. The category slowed, but I think that those -- we are taking steps to address and introduce more and different innovation in those markets and to grow them. So we do look forward to having a really attractive runway around the world for us.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks.
Rodney Sacks: On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate, to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad, and in particular, capitalizing on our relationship with the Coca-Cola bottler system. We believe that we are well-positioned in the beverage industry and continue to be optimistic about the future of our company. We hope that you remain safe and healthy, and thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-11-02 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. And welcome to the Monster Beverage Company Third Quarter 2023 Conference call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rodney Sacks and Hilton Schlosberg, Co-CEOs. Please go ahead.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I am Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and my Co-Chief Executive Officer is on the call; as is Tom Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom Kelly will now read our cautionary statement.
Tom Kelly: Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Act of 1934 as amended, and are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends.

Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2023 and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you, Tom. On July 31, 2023, the company completed its acquisition of Bang Energy, which is the Bang Transaction. The acquired assets primarily include Bang Energy Drinks and a beverage production facility in Phoenix, Arizona. Inventory purchased as part of the Bang Transaction was recorded at fair value. Certain of the purchased inventory was subsequently sold in the 2023 third quarter and was recognized through cost of sales at fair value, which we define as the Bang Inventory Step-Up hereafter in the call. As a result of the Bang Inventory Step-Up, gross profit was adversely impacted by approximately $7.8 million during the 2023 third quarter. During the 2023 third quarter, in connection with the Bang Transaction, the company recorded a gain of $45.4 million, which will be referred to hereinafter as the Bang Transaction Gain, in interest and other income and expense net within the condensed consolidated statement of income. During the 2023 third quarter, the company incurred approximately $8 million of acquisition expenses related to the Bang Transaction and those are referred to also later in this call as the Bang Transaction Expenses. The company achieved record third quarter net sales of $1.86 billion in the 2023 third quarter, 14.3% higher than net sales of $1.62 billion in the 2022 comparable period and 16.1% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 third quarter was 53%, compared with 51.3% in the comparative 2022 third quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 53.4% for the 2023 third quarter, excluding the Bang Inventory Step-Up. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 third quarter as compared to the 2022 third quarter was primarily the result of pricing actions, decreased freight-in costs and decreased aluminum can costs. Promotional allowances for the 2023 third quarter were higher than in the comparable 2022 third quarter, as well as the 2023 second quarter. Operating expenses for the 2023 third quarter were $473.2 million, compared with $415.8 million in the 2022 third quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2023 third quarter were 25.5%, compared with 25.6% in the 2022 third quarter. Operating expenses for the 2023 third quarter included approximately $8 million of Bang Transaction-related expenses. Distribution expenses for the 2023 third quarter were $85.7 million or 4.6% of net sales, compared to $83 million or 5.1% of net sales in the 2022 third quarter. Operating income for the 2023 third quarter increased to 22.2% to $510.5 million from $417.9 million in the 2022 comparative quarter. Interest and other income expense net for the 2023 third quarter increased to $71.4 million from $2.1 million in the 2022 comparative quarter. The increase was due to $39.3 million of interest income and a gain of $45.4 million related to the Bang Transaction. Such amounts were partially offset by foreign currency transaction losses of $13.2 million. The effective tax rate for the 2023 third quarter was 22.2%, compared with 23.3% in the 2022 third quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to an increase in deductible interest expense. Net income increased 40.4% to $452.7 million, as compared to the $322.4 million in the 2022 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2023 third quarter increased 41.3% to $0.43 from $0.30 in the third quarter of 2022. Diluted earnings per share adjusted for the Bang Transaction Gain, the Bang Inventory Step-Up and the Bang Transaction Expenses net of tax was $0.41 for the 2023 third quarter, an increase of 34.1%. The company plans to implement additional price increases in certain international markets during the remainder of the 2023 year. We will continue to review further opportunities for pricing actions in order to mitigate inflationary pressures. According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through October 21, 2023, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including energy shots increased by 9.2% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of the company’s energy brands excluding Bang were up 6.7% in the 13-week period, sales of Monster were up 4.8%, sales of Reign were up 36.3%, sales of NOS increased 10% and sales of Full Throttle increased 7.6%. Sales of Red Bull increased 3%. The company continues to have market share leadership in the energy drink category for all outlets combined in the United States in both the 13-week and four-week periods ended October 21, 2023. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended October 21, 2023, sales in dollars in the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increased 6.7% over the same period the previous year. Sales of the company’s energy brands, excluding Bang, increased 4.5% in the four-week period in the convenience and gas channel. Sales of Monster increased by 1.9% over the same period versus the previous year. Reign sales increased 35.2%, NOS was up 9.7% and Full Throttle was up 7.8%. Sales of Red Bull were up 1.8%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended October 21, 2023, the company’s market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel including energy shots in dollars decreased from 36.8% to 36.1%, excluding Bang. Monster share decreased from 31.1% a year ago to 29.7%. Reign share increased 0.6 of a share point to 3%, NOS share increased share increased 0.1% of a share point to 2.6% and Full Throttle share remained at 0.7 of a percent. Bang share was 1.4%. Red Bull share decreased 1.7 points to 34.5, Five Hour share was lower by half a point at 3.5%, Rockstar share was down 0.4 of a point to 3.4%, Celsius’ share is 7.4%, C Four’s share is 3.3% and Ghosts’ share is 2.7%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended October 21, 2023, sales in dollars in the coffee plus energy drink category, which includes our Java Monster line in the convenience and gas channel increased 8.9% over the same period the previous year. Sales of Java Monster including Java Monster 300 and Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew were 2% lower in the same period versus the previous year. Sales of Starbucks Energy was 14.9% lower. Java Monster share of the coffee plus energy drink category for the four weeks ended October 21, 2023, was 55.9%, up 3.9 points, while Starbucks Energy’s share was 43.8%, down 3.1 points. According to Nielsen, in all major channels in Canada for the 12 weeks ended October 7, 2023, the energy drink category increased 8.6% in dollars. Sales of the company’s energy drink brands increased 6.5% versus a year ago. The market share of the company’s energy drink brands was 40%, down 0.8 of a point. Monster sales increased 7.7% and its market share decreased 0.3 of a point to 36.2%. NOS sales decreased half a point and its market share decreased by 0.1 of a point to 1.2%, sorry, the sales decreased 5 point -- 0.5%. Full Throttle sales increased 12.8% and its market share remained at 0.5%. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category increased 20% for the month of September 2023, Monster sales increased 22.7%, Monster’s market share in value increased 0.7 points to 29.3% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Predator increased 60.3% and its market share increased 1.5 share points to 6.1%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced, positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXA convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXA convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen, for the month of September 2023 compared to September 2022, Monster’s retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 52.8% to 56.8%, in Brazil from 43% to 45.1% and decreased in Chile from 41.7% to 39.9%. Monster Energy is the leading energy brand in value in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. I would like to point out, the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country-to-country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until October 8, 2023, Monster’s retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 30.5% to 31.3% in France, from 29.9% to 32.4% in Great Britain, from 5.4% to 5.6% in the Netherlands, from 31.6% to 34.7% in Norway and from 40.3% to 40.5% in Spain.

We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or four-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. was $733.7 million or 39.5% of total net sales in the 2023 third quarter, compared to $610.6 million or 37.6% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2022. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on net sales in the U.S. dollars by approximately $29.2 million in the 2023 third quarter. Included in reported geographic sales, our ourselves to the company’s military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA, net sales in the 2023 third quarter increased 22.3% in dollars and increased 23.6% in local currencies over the same period in 2022.

We continued with the launch of the Beast Unleashed during the quarter, which is now available in 43 states, through a network of beer distributors. We are pleased with the initial results of the Beast Unleashed and are continuing to expand distribution with the goal of being available in substantially all of the United States by the end of 2023. We plan to launch Nasty Beast Hard Tea in the first quarter of 2024 with the goal of being national -- of national distribution in the first half of next year. Nasty Beast Hard Tea will be available in four flavors and will be sold in 24-ounce single-serve cans, as well as in a variety 12-pack of 12-ounce sleek cans. In the United States, we launched Bang Energy in 12 single SKUs and two multi-pack SKUs through our Coca-Cola bottlers in the month of September. In the 2023 third quarter, we also shipped NOS Zero-Sugar 16-ounce cans to support our planned 2023 fourth quarter launch. In Mexico, during July 2023, we launched our third Predator SKU with Predator Purple Rain and expanded our Monster Zero-Sugar offering with the launch of Monster Ultra Watermelon in August 2023. In El Salvador and Honduras, during the month of September, we launched Reserve White Pineapple. And in Puerto Rico, we launched Monster Ozzy Style Lemonade in July 2023, and in September, we introduced our Reign Storm total wellness energy drinks. In Australia, Monster Ultra Peachy Keen was launched in July 2023. In September, we launched Mother Reignbow Sherbet in Australia and Mother Lava Guava in New Zealand. In EMEA, in the third quarter of 2023, we launched Monster Nitro Cosmic Peach, Reserve Watermelon and White Pineapple, Juiced Aussie Lemonade, Juiced Chaotic, Ultra Gold and Ultra Peachy Keen in a number of countries. We are excited about the launch of Monster Zero-Sugar in Great Britain in the 2023 third quarter. We will expand distribution to Poland and the Republic of Ireland in the 2023 fourth quarter and to an additional 28 markets by the end of the first quarter of 2024. During the third quarter of 2023, we launched Monster Ultra Peachy Keen in Japan and launched Predator in Iraq. In October 2023, we launched Monster Ozzy Lemonade in Japan. In India, we participate not only in the premium energy drink segment with Monster but also in the more affordable segment with Predator. We recently introduced Predator in a 250 ml PET format in a limited region in India to complement our existing product offering is 300 ml cans. We also transitioned the Monster brand in the Philippines from our independent distributor to our Coca-Cola Philippines bottler. During the 2023 third quarter, the company purchased approximately 7.3 million shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $54.83 per share for a total amount of $400 million, excluding broker commissions. As of November 2, approximately $282.8 million remained available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase program. We estimate that on a foreign currency-adjusted basis, including the alcohol brands segment, October 2023 sales were approximately 25.8% higher than in the comparable October 2022 sales and 25% higher than October 2022, excluding the alcohol brands segment. We estimate that October 2023 sales including the alcohol brands segment to be approximately 24.8% higher than in October 2022 and 24% higher than in October 2022, excluding the alcohol brands segment. October 2023 had one more selling day compared to October 2022. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules, this affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintained inventory levels according to their own internal requirements, which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I’d like to summarize some recent positive points. The energy category continues to grow globally. We are pleased to report that our pricing actions which have been implemented to partially mitigate inflationary pressures have not significantly impacted consumer demand. Our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower land of costs to our EMEA region. We are continuing with our plans to add a Juice facility to our AFF flavor facility in Ireland. We are pleased with our 2023 new product innovations, notably Monster Energy Zero-Sugar, Ultra Strawberry Dreams and Rainstorm in the United States and Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton 44 Zero-Sugar in EMEA. We are pleased with the early results from the launch of the Beast Unleashed. We are continuing to expand distribution with the goal of being national by the end of the year. We are excited for the launch of Nasty Beast Hard Tea early next year with a goal of national distribution in the first half of 2024, as well as the additional alcohol opportunities that the CANarchy acquisition presents. We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in a number of additional countries internationally. We are excited about the opportunities that the acquisition of the Bang Energy brand presents to us and believe that the brand will fit well within our broader portfolio of energy drink brands. I’d like to now open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Peter Grom with UBS. Please go ahead.
Peter Grom: Thanks, Operator. Good afternoon, guys. Hope you are doing well. So maybe one housekeeping question…
Rodney Sacks: Good afternoon.
Peter Grom: … and then one real question here. I guess, on just the Bang Transaction, I apologize if I missed this, but did you mention how much of a contribution the transaction was to sales in the quarter? And then, I guess, just my real question here is, I would love to get some more color on the quarter-to-date trends you just mentioned. I think it was 25% or so, much better than what we can see in the track data. So can you maybe unpack the drivers of that? Is that simply just much stronger growth in international markets or is there any sort of sales pull-forward or timing impacts that we need to take into consideration? Just any color there I think would be really helpful. Thanks.
Rodney Sacks: Okay. Firstly, with regard to the Bang Transaction and the Bang sales numbers, we do not separately give those numbers. They are all included within the Monster Energy Drinks segment. We launched Bang Energy in September through the Coke bottling system and it was not an immediate launch on September 1, some bottlers took a little bit earlier in August and many that rolled out in September, rolled out through the month of September. So this is not a real fair quarter for the capability of what Bang can bring to the portfolio. And then, on your second point, it was very difficult to hear you, Peter. I think you are referring to the October sales, were you not?
Peter Grom: Yeah. I was just trying to understand, I think you mentioned 25% or so, it’s just a lot different or stronger than what we can see in track data even after backing out kind of the Bang drag. So I just was trying to get some color in terms of what were the drivers of that, is it simply stronger growth outside the U.S. or is it -- is there any sort of timing contributions or pull-forward in sales, just any color you can provide I think would be really helpful.
Rodney Sacks: Well, I think, it’s important to understand that we have large unmeasured channels. And when one looks at Nielsen or IRI numbers, one doesn’t really appreciate that the company operates through -- customers that do not participate in Nielsen or are not measured by Nielsen. And in addition a number of chain stores that allow pickup of products or ordering online, those numbers are not included within the all major channels that we see on the Nielsen. They included in the stores data, but they are not included in the all measured channels. Why? I really cannot answer that question. So there are a number of factors. The business was strong. We had a good October and those are the numbers. So, I really cannot comment anymore.
Operator: The next question is from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Drew Levine: Hey. Good afternoon. This is Drew Levine on for Andrea. Thank you for taking our question. So just wanted to circle back on the Bang acquisition and the transition to the Coke bottling system. Just any high level thoughts on improving distribution and sort of timeline to regaining shelf space for the brand would be helpful. And then, secondarily, within the Nielsen and IRI channels, it does appear that, sequentially, some of these more sort of emerging brands aren’t really gaining as much market share sequentially. So just any high level thoughts on the category dynamics if you think those emerging brands might be hitting on a sort of ceiling and Monster’s position within there, that would be helpful? Thank you.
Rodney Sacks: Yeah. So, remember, that number of both convenience and chain and other large stores discontinued the Bang brand during a period where there was a litigation and also with the products were questionable as regards to labeling. So there was a lot of discontinuation of Bang throughout the system. What we are doing and what our Coke bottlers are doing is regaining the distribution that is out there for Bang and also we are as a company making presentations to the large and smaller retailers, both convenience, grocery, mass, and obviously, the club channel to ensure that Bang is restocked in their sets. So that will take a little bit of time, it doesn’t happen overnight and we are hopeful that we will be able to achieve really very much extended distribution in the new sets as they come out. And then on your second question regarding the smaller brands, already we have a mission that’s focused on our brands and our brand families, and I really don’t want to comment on the competition. Other than to say that we have a very comprehensive portfolio here and we believe that we are in a good position to focus and build upon our own sales, while recognizing the achievements of the competitors and the positioning of the competitors.
Operator: The next question is from Vivien Azer with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Vivien Azer: Hi. Good evening. Thank you. I wanted to follow up on your commentary, just now in terms of the conversations that you are having with retailers, recognizing that it might be a little bit early days in terms of driving for extended shelf reset and increased placement on Bang, but operationally, kind of how are you thinking about that? Is it kind of a one-for-one for every market share point of improvement you think you can drive for Bang that’s incremental square footage? Are you willing to sacrifice some linear square footage on tertiary, SKUs within your own portfolio to revitalize that brand, any incremental color would be helpful? Thank you.
Rodney Sacks: Yeah. We have set our sales team an objective and that is they are not compromise any of our existing shelf space to incorporate the Bang brand. The Bang brand has emerged as a lifestyle brand and we believe it should be positioned in a -- hopefully in a separate cooler away from the energy beverages that includes the wellness beverages and the performance beverages and that’s the mission that we are focusing on with our sales teams.
Operator: The next question is from Charlie Higgs with Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead.
Charlie Higgs: Hey, Hilton and Rodney. I hope you are both well fine. I got a question on China, please, and the good 28% growth you posted there. Just wondering if you could give any color on that number. It’s a lot stronger than competitors seem to be posting in China. And then, just how the portfolio shaping up there, and then, you -- have you launched Predator there? Thanks.
Hilton Schlosberg: Perhaps, I will just take that. The brand, we have sort of looked at realigning the brand and focusing on the main SKUs and we are gaining additional sales and traction with the brands. So the brands, particularly, Green and Ultra, are doing very well in China and continuing to grow and getting solid sales per SKU -- per point of distribution. With regard to Predator, we are proceeding with our plans to launch Predator and that will happen towards the middle of next year, probably, the second quarter as presently planned. So that will go ahead in a PET bottle. So we are also pretty hopeful that we will have two offerings at different price points to attack the Chinese market. Thanks.
Operator: The next question is from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Mark Astrachan: Yeah. Hey, guys. Good afternoon.
Rodney Sacks: Hi.
Mark Astrachan: Just one follow-up on one other question. So if you look at the scanner data, we look at total distribution points for Bang, I show it’s up something like 22% at current levels or kind of a week or two ago relative to where it was even in September. So you had mentioned helping that, I think, the rollout in September was a bit more measured. So I suppose why shouldn’t we get a little more excited about what you can do from shelf space in terms of where it was? I guess it’s never going to be what it was a few years ago, but certainly seems like it’s on a good starting level there. And then, the main question, we are getting lots of questions and I am sure you are about how to think about pricing and what Red Bull is going to do in the market. I guess, how long does it take for you to figure out how much pricing Red Bull is going to pass-through and how quickly or when you have to tell the retail establishments that you are planning on following them if you decide to do that? Thanks.
Rodney Sacks: Well, generally when you have a price increase in our industry, it takes 60 days to 90 days to get pricing adjusted in the U.S. market. I think where we are is, we are evaluating the competition, and obviously, we are reevaluating Red Bull and their pricing and we will see where it goes. They took -- because of promotions they took a lot less in 2022 than was originally expected. So I think we just watching for what happens with demand and the elasticity of demand and we are in a really difficult consumer environment, not necessarily for energy drinks as you have heard on this call. But I think we have to be very wary and watch and see and we will evaluate what makes sense for us and time we will make a decision. I mean we have always said that if there is an opportunity to take price, we will, but we are also very cognizant of the fact that, we don’t want to lose a bunch of market share in the process. And then, Mark, you referred earlier to Bang, and yes, the Coke bottlers during the month of September got Bang back in as many shelves as they were authorized to get product back. And yes, of course, there was an increase in September, but -- and October, and we will continue seeing the development of Bang as we get more and more shelf space authorized to -- for the brand. But as always, we don’t give guidance on these calls and but I will just say that, we are all optimistic here about the future and the potential of the brand otherwise we wouldn’t have done the acquisition.
Operator: The next question is from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Michael Lavery: Thank you. Good afternoon.
Rodney Sacks: Hi. Just was wondering if you could give a sense of strategically how you think about the portfolio. In the US, you have got the share headwinds are greater for the Monster brand versus some others. Maybe just how do you think about resource allocation or trying to push to protect and strengthen that brand, what kind of margin mix implications are there or is it just anything under the total corporate umbrella is -- if it it’s got momentum is great. Just give us good a little sense of how you think about the portfolio, strategy and how much -- how important it is for Monster to take the lead or not?
Rodney Sacks: I think Monster has always been our lead brand and will continue to be the lead brand. So, ultimately, we focus on Monster itself. And then, we look at the broader portfolio, we look at the category. The category has got grown in the last couple of years and it’s much, much broader than it was and so we think that Monster’s positioning should stay as it is, it’s got -- its positioning, it’s got its authenticity and credibility for what it stands for and it can’t be everything to all consumers. And that’s why these other brands play a really important role for the company and enable us to actually attack other parts of the category, other consumers who have different values and have different need states, whether it’s from NOS to Reign. You saw the results of Reign have increased and sales have really been very healthy. So that brand is doing very well with its positioning, which is different to the positioning we have got for Rainstorm. And then, the same thing that, as Hilton mentioned earlier, we have sort of -- we have taken the positioning of -- for Bang as sort of more of a lifestyle brand. Again, it has its own positioning. The cans, as you know, in the last few years has changed from being a black can, more performance orientated to be a white can, more lifestyle orientated. So there are different positionings, different price points, we think that we will get incremental space for these other brands in joining coolers or additional coolers space, where you are having the -- where you are finding more space being allocated to the clean energy or natural or sort of healthier perception energy brands. As you -- also look at sizes, Rainstorm is in a 12-ounce cans versus our traditional Reign brand in a 60-ounce black can. So these are ways that we are able to distinguish these different products and find a place for each of them on the shelf and to attract different consumers. And so, if you look at the whole portfolio, we think it actually fits together quite nicely and we see growth coming from all of these different levels, but still 100% our main brand remains and our focus is obviously Monster, which is the driver for the company and will continue to be so.
Hilton Schlosberg: Rodney, I think, one other point for Michael is that, if -- Mike, you need to look at the numbers, because, I think, Red Bull is suffering far worse than Monster and the -- I think that’s something you need to look at. That’s number one. And number two, a number of our analysts are -- and we have noticed this as of late, are taking the Bang numbers and putting the Bang numbers into Monster, both this year and last year. And obviously, that’s not a great exercise, because Bang has -- Bang share and Bang sales have fallen off dramatically over the last year, particularly through all this litigation and with the removal from shelves and the discontinuations as I mentioned earlier. So that’s not a good exercise to put the Bang brand into Monster this year and last year. So what we did on this call, we actually separated Bang separately and the rest of the portfolio so one could get a feel of the performance of the Monster portfolio separately from what’s happening with Bang. Hopefully, sometime down the line we will be able to roll the two into one another and then it will make better sense of growth or otherwise.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Sacks for any closing remarks.
Rodney Sacks: Thanks. On behalf of the company, I’d like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. And in particular capitalizing on our relationship with the Coca-Cola bottler system. We believe that we are well-positioned in the beverage industry and continue to be optimistic about the future of our company. We hope that you remain safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-08-03 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Corporation Second Quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, today's event is being recorded. I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rodney Sacks and Hilton Schlosberg, Co-CEOs of Monster Beverage. Please go ahead.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, is on the call; as is Tom Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom Kelly will now read our cautionary statement.
Tom Kelly: Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends.

Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2023, and quarterly report on Form-Q including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements, for a discussion on specific risk and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks.
Rodney Sacks : Thanks Tom. The company achieved record second quarter net sales of $1.85 billion in the 2023 second quarter, 12.1% higher than net sales of $1.66 billion in the 2022 comparable period, and 14.4% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 second quarter was 52.5% compared with 47.1% in the comparative 2022 second quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 second quarter as compared to the 2022 second quarter was primarily the result of pricing actions, decreased operating costs and increased aluminum can costs. The increase was partially offset by lower gross margins in the alcohol segment and in which our sales had quite a nice bump as you seen from the release. As expected, promotional allowances for the 2023 second quarter were marginally higher than the comparable 2022 second quarter, as well as 2023 first quarter. Operating expenses for the 2023 second quarter were $450.4 million, compared with $406.9 million in the 2022 second quarter, as a percentage of net sales operating expenses for the 2023 second quarter were 24.3% compared to 24.6% in the 2022 second quarter. Distribution expenses for the 2023 second quarter decreased to $82 million, or 4.4% of net sales compared to $87.9 million or 5.3% of net sales in the 2022 second quarter. The $5.8 million decrease in distribution expenses was primarily due to decreased freight out expenses of $11.8 million partially offset by higher warehouse expenses of $4.8 million as a result of higher raw materials and finished product inventories in the United States and EMEA. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to increased payroll expenses. We are purchasing aluminum cans from local sources globally. We have returned to our orbit strategy of producing in closer proximity to our customers. The costs of repositioning finished products to distribution centers are included in freight-in costs. The company continues to address certain challenges in its supply chain as it navigates the current global supply chain environment. Operating income for the 2023 second quarter increased 14.4% to $523.8 from $373 million in the 2022 comparative quarter. The effective tax rate for the 2023 second quarter was 23.2% compared with 25.3% in the 2022 second quarter, the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to an increase in deductible interest expense, a decrease in the effective state income tax rate, as well as an increase in net income in certain foreign jurisdictions, which have lower tax rates compared to the United States. Net income increased 51.4% to $413.9 million, as compared to $273.4 million in the 2022 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2023 second quarter increased 52.8% to $0.39 from $0.26 in the second quarter of 2022. Due to continued cost pressures, the company implemented pricing actions in the United States in 2022, as well as in many other international markets in 2022, and in the first half of 2023. The company plans to implement additional price increases in a number of other international markets during the remainder of the 2023 year. In the United States, the company implemented an additional price increase on its 18.6 ounce and 24 ounce lines effective April 1, 2023. We will continue to review further opportunities for pricing actions in order to mitigate inflationary pressures. According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through July 22, 2023 for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including Energy Shots increased by 13.6% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of the company's energy brands, including Reign were up 12.2% in the 13 week period, sales of Monster were up 10.5%, Sales of Reign were up 43.7%, sales of NOS increased 11.2% and sales a Full Throttle increased 14.7%. Sale of Red Bull increased 10.2%. The company continues to have market leaders share leadership in the energy drink category for all outlets combined in the United States in both the 13 week and four week periods ended July 22, 2023. According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended July 22, 2023, sales in dollars in the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including Energy Shots in dollars increased 13.7% over the same period, the previous year. Sales of the company energy brands which include Reign increased 13.8% in the four week period in the convenience and gas channel, sales of Monster increased by 11.1%over the same period versus the previous year. Reign sales increased 54.9%, NOS was up 13.2%, Full Throttle was up 23.2% sales of Red Bull were up 8.8%. According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended July 22, 2023, the company's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increase from 36% to 36.1%. Monster share decreased from 30.4% a year ago to 29.8%, Reign sharing increased to 0.8 of share point to 3.1%, NOS’s share remain at 2.5% and Full Throttle share remained at 0.7%. Red Bull’s share decreased 1.6 points from 36.3% a year ago to 34.7%, VPX Bang’s share decreased 4.2 points to 1.8%. Five Hour share was lower by 0.7 point at 3.5%. Rockstar share was down 0.2 over point to 3.4%, Celsius’ share is 6.6%, C Four’s share is 3% and Ghosts share is 2.8%. Please note that VPX Bank was in bankruptcy during this period, and we will address our acquisition of Bang later in this call. According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended July 22 2023, sales in dollars in the coffee plus energy drink category, which includes our Java Monster line in the convenience and gas channel decreased 3% over the same period the previous year. Sales of Java Monster including Java Monster 300 and Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew was 3.3% higher in the same period versus the previous year. Sales of Starbucks Energy was 7% lower, Java Monster share of the coffee plus energy drink category for the four weeks ended July 22, 2023 was 54.1%, up 3.3 points, while Starbucks Energy's share was 45.6% down two points. According to Nielsen in all major channels in Canada for the 12 weeks ended June 17, 2023, the energy drink category increased 14.8% in dollars. Sales of the company's energy drink brands increased 21.6% versus a year ago. The market share of the company's energy drink brands was 42.4%, up 2.4 points, Monster sales increased 25.6% and its market sharing increased 3.3 points to 38.1% NOS’s sales decreased to 5.8% and its market share decreased 0.3 over point to 1.3%. Full Throttle sales decreased 43.2% and its market share decrease 0.3 over point to 0.3%. According to Nielsen for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category increased 23.7% for the month of June 2023. Monster sales increased 25.3%. Monster’s market sharing value increased 0.4 points to 28.8% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Predator increased 75.3% and its market sharing increased 1.7 points to 5.6%. The Nielsen's statistics from Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and or negatively by sales in the OXA convenience chain, which dominates the market sales in the OXA convenience chain in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen for the month of June 2023 compared to June 2022, Monster’s retail market sharing value increased in Argentina from 50.5% to 55.5%, in Chile from 38.1% to 40.8%. And in Brazil from 41.6% to 44.4%. Monster Energy is the leading energy brand in value in Argentina, Brazil and Chile. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide. Because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country. According to Nielsen in a 13 week period until June 18, 2023. Monster’s retail market sharing value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 16.2% to 16.6% in Belgium, from 32.7% 33.1% in France, from 29.8% to 31.1%, in Great Britain, from 31.8% to 35.2% in Norway, from 28.1% to 30.3% in the Republic of Ireland, from 39.4% to 41.6% in Spain, and from 15.6% to 15.9% in Sweden.

According to IRI in Australia, Monster’s market sharing value for the four weeks ending July 9, 2023, increased from 14.1% to 16.9% as compared to the same period the previous year. Mother's market sharing value decreased from 10.4% to 10.3%. According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster’s market sharing value for the four weeks ended July 9, 2023 increased from 12.6% to 14.9% compared to the same period of the previous year. Live Plus’s market sharing value decreased from 6.5% to 5.6%, and Mother's market sharing value remained at 5.3%. According to INTAGE in Japan in the month ending June 2023 Monster’s market sharing value in the convenience store channel, as compared to the same period the previous year declined from 56.7% to 55.1%. According to Nielsen in South Korea, in the month ending June 2023, Monster’s market sharing value in all outlets combined, as compared to the same period the previous year decreased from 59.9% to 57.6%. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or four week periods may often be materially influenced positively and or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during these periods. Net sales to customers outside the US was $715.4 million, 38.6% of total net sales in the 2023 second quarter compared to $649 million, or 39.2% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2022. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on net sales in the US and US dollars by approximately $38.4 million in the 2023 second quarter. Included in reported geographic sales, our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the US and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA, net sales in the 2023 second quarter, increased 13% in dollars, and increased 16.4% in local currencies over the same period in 2022. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the second quarter was 34% compared to 26.7% in the same quarter in 2022. We are pleased that in the 2023 second quarter Monster gained market share in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Norway, the Republic of Ireland, Spain and Sweden. In Asia Pacific, net sales in the 2023 second quarter increased 17.8% in dollars and increased 26.7% in local currencies over the same period in 2022. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 42.4% versus 40.4% over the same period in 2022. Net sales in Japan in the 2023 second quarter increased 11.9% in dollars and increased 21.2% in local currency. In South Korea, net sales increased 50.3% in dollars and increased 59.5% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2022. Monster remains the market leader in Japan and South Korea. In China, net sales in the second quarter increased 3.7% in dollars and increased 10.6% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2022. We remain optimistic about the prospects for the Monster brand in China. In the 2022 second quarter, our distribution partners restocked inventories following the easing of the COVID-19 restrictions in China. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 26% in dollars and 36.4% in local currencies. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the 2023 second quarter increased 0.1 of a percent in dollars, and increased 9.4% in local currencies over the same period in 2022. In Brazil, net sales in the 2023 second quarter increased by 2.5% in dollars, and 3.6% in local currency. Net sales in Mexico increased 23.3% in dollars, and 10.1% in local currency in the 2023 second quarter. Net sales in Chile decreased 23.8% in dollars, and decreased 26.6% in local currency in the 2023 second quarter. The decrease in sales in Chile were due in part to a normalization of bottler inventory levels. Net sales in Argentina decreased 19.5% in dollars, but increased 54% in local currency in the 2023 second quarter. We will now provide an update on our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals Inc. which will be referred to as VPX, the former maker of Bang Energy drinks. We previously discussed the trademark infringement arbitration in which an arbitrator found against VPX and awarded Monster Energy Company or MEC and Orange Bank, $175 million in damages, attorneys fees and costs and an ongoing 5% royalty on future sales of certain Bang Energy. VPX has appealed the judgment. We also previously discussed the false advertising case in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, in which the jury returned a verdict awarding MEC approximately $293 million in damages. And the District Court granted MEC’s motion for a permanent injunction in joining VPX and former CEO Jack Owoc from falsely or deceptively claiming that Bang any other beverages contained creatine or form of creatine, VPX and Jack Owoc appealed the injunction. The bodies have completed briefing on remaining post round issues On October 10, 2022 VPX, along with certain of its domestic subsidiaries, and affiliates filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. On June 28, 2023, VPX and certain affiliates entered into an asset purchase agreement with the company, which among other things provided for the company's acquisition of substantially all of the VPX's assets. The transactions contemplated by the asset purchase agreement closed on July 31, 2023, at which time the company was deemed to have allowed general unsecured claims in VPX's bankruptcy case relating to the arbitration award, and the jury's award, subject to the potential modification of the Jury Award in the light of pending post-verdict motions filed by MEC and VPX. The asset purchase agreement also includes a mutual release between VPX and MEC which among other things, requires VPX to dismiss its appeals of the trademark infringement arbitration and the false advertising case, as well as cases that VPX filed against MEC in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. This mutual release does not include any claims the company might have against Mr. Owoc in relation to their jury award. The company will not recognize the allowed general unsecured claims or the jury award as it relates to Mr. Owoc [inaudible] realized or realizable. We will not be answering questions on these legal proceedings on today's call. In June 2023, the company also entered into an agreement with Orange Bank Inc. regarding the company's use and registration of certain bank trademarks and trade names subject to the successful closure of the asset purchase agreement. Under this agreement, the company will pay Orange Bank Inc. a onetime payment of approximately $12.5 million and a 2.5% royalty on all future sales of products bearing the trade name Bang. On June 31, 2023, we completed our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Vital Pharmaceuticals Inc. Sorry, apologize on July 31 2023, we completed its acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and certain of its affiliates, collectively Bang Energy for a purchase price of approximately $362 million, subject to adjustments. The acquired assets include Bang Energy beverages, and a beverage production facility in Phoenix, Arizona. We successfully recruited a limited number of former VPX employees to fill certain open positions within Monster, as well as the majority of the team at the manufacturing site in Phoenix. Pursuant to Monster's obligations with the Coca Cola Company, Bang Energy will be distributed through the Coca Cola bottlers network, starting with the United States in the 2023 third quarter. As a result, there will be a temporary disruption of the product supply of Bang Energy brand energy drinks. Additionally, our intention is to rationalize Bang’s product offerings and product lines and to fully integrate Bang into the Monster infrastructure. We do not intend to manufacture or sell Bang’s other product lines such as Red Line or Shots beyond liquidating existing inventories at this time, we may consider reintroducing certain of those product lines sometime in the future. We are excited about our acquisition of the state of the art Bang Energy production facility in Phoenix, Arizona, which we intend to utilize for Bang as well as other products in the Monster portfolio. As we only completed the acquisition this week, it is still early days and we will provide you with further updates on Bang Energy on our next Investor Call in November. In the first half of 2023, we launched The Beast Unleashed which is now available in 28 states through a network of beer distributors. We are pleased with the early results and are continuing to expand distribution, with the goal of being national by the end of the year. According to Nielsen scan data, The Beast Unleashed is currently one of the top new brands in the beer category in 2023. We plan to launch a hot iced tea extension of The Beast Unleashed named Nasty Beast Hardcore Tea later this year or early next year, with a goal of national distribution in the first half of 2024. The brand will have full flavors Original, Half & Half, Razzleberry and Green. Nasty Beast Hardcore Tea will be available in 24 oz. single-serve cans as well as in a variety 12-pack in 12 ounce sleek cans. We refreshed the dials and doubled dials beer brands in the first half of 2023 and introduced Dale's American Light Lager as part of the refresh. The brand family has performed well since the refresh. The high Lybrand family the largest in our beer portfolio, from scarcity is also performing well despite overall headwinds in the craft segment and is showing growth in retail scans. Our Alcohol Beverage innovation pipeline is robust, and we look forward to sharing use of additional new products in the future. In the 2023 second quarter in the United States, we focused on gaining distribution on our first quarter product innovation. Following the success of our recent Monster Energy Zero- Sugar launch, we are planning to launch NOS Zero-Sugar in 16 ounce cans in the 2023 fourth quarter. In the 2023 second quarter, we expanded our Java Monster portfolio in Canada with the launch of Java Monster 300 Triple Shot, Mocha and Vanilla. We launched several new products in Latin America in the 2023 second quarter. In Argentina, we introduced our Monster Reserve brand, with the launch of Reserve White Pineapple in June. In the Caribbean, we continue to expand our portfolio and introduced a number of new products in different countries. After we successfully launched Java Monster Super Coffee, Mean Bean and Loca Mocha in Australia earlier this year, we expanded the launch of such products to the New Zealand market in the 2023 second quarter. We are pleased with early results in both markets. In EMEA, in the second quarter of 202,3 we launched Monster Reserve Watermelon and White Pineapple, Ultra Gold, Ultra Fiesta Mango, Ultra Paradise, Ultra Rosa, Ultra Watermelon, Used Ozzy Lemonade and Used Chaotic in a number of countries. During the 2023 second quarter, we also launched additional SK use or BPM, Burn, Nalu, Predator and Reign in certain countries. We launched the Monster Energy brand in Egypt in June 2023. To add to Predator which we launched earlier this year in Egypt. In EMEA, as part of an ongoing pan EMEA launch, we expanded the distribution of our Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton 44 Zero-Sugar Energy drink to an additional eight EMEA markets in the second quarter of 2023 for a total of 35 markets to date. During the second quarter of 2023, we launched Monster Reserve Watermelon in Japan and Monster Ultra Sunrise in Korea and Monster Reserve Pineapple in Turkey. We launched Predator in additional regions in India. We are planning to introduce the Predator brand in additional countries in APAC in the course of 2023. In July 2023, we launched Monster Ultra Peachy Keen in Japan and Predator in Iraq. Monster Energy will be launched in the Philippines later this year. We estimate that on a foreign currency adjusted basis, including the alcohol brands segment, July 2023 sales were approximately 13.7% higher than the comparable July 2022 sales and 12% higher than July ‘22 excluding the alcohol brand segment. We estimate July 2023 sales, including the alcohol brand segment to be approximately 12.1% higher than in July 2022 and 11.2% higher than in July 2022, excluding the alcohol brand segment. July 2023 had the same number of selling days as July 2022. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches, and the timing of price increases, and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules. This affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintain inventory levels according to their own internal requirements, which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. First, the energy category continues to grow globally. Second, we are pleased to report that our pricing actions which have been implemented to partially mitigate inflationary pressures have not significantly impacted consumer demand. Third, our IFF labor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower land of costs to our EMEA region. Fourth, we are enthusiastic for 2023 new product innovations, notably Monster Energy Zero-Sugar, Ultra Strawberry Dreams, Rainstorm and Tour Water in United States and Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton 44 Zero-Sugar in EMEA. Fifth, we are pleased with the early results from the launch of The Beast Unleashed, we are continuing to expand distribution with the goal of being national by the end of the year. Sixth, we are excited about the launch of Nasty Beast Hardcore Tea later this year or early next year, with the goal of national distribution in the first half of 2024 as well as the additional alcohol opportunities that the CANarchy acquisition presents. Seven, we are pleased with the initial results of our launch Rainstorm, our new line of Total Wellness Energy drinks. Eight, we are pleased with the rollout of Prince and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally, we are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in a number -- additional number of international markets. Nine, we are excited about the opportunities that the acquisition of the Bang Energy brand presents to us and believe that the brand will fit well within our broader portfolio of energy drink brands. I would like to now open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Peter Grom at UBS.
Peter Grom: Thanks, operator and good afternoon, guys. Hope you're doing well. So I wanted to pick up on the gross margin commentary and just get a sense for how the quarter kind of came in versus your expectations. This is the first time we haven't really seen the sequential improvement on gross margin in about a year. And I know you mentioned promotion, I think you've talked about other costs, back at the shareholder meeting. But can you maybe just talk about how you see the drivers of gross margin evolving through the balance of the year, should we still expect to see sequential progression from here? And then maybe bigger picture, can you help frame where we are on the long term margin recovery journey. Thanks.
Hilton Schlosberg: Peter, the difficult answers your question is that we really don't give guidance. So if we look at this quarter that we just reporting, we spoke about some of the drivers behind the improvement in gross margin. But against that, we did have continued increases, and I've said this in previous quarters in certain ingredients and other input costs, as well as co-packing. So that's the fact that will stay with us. And then we have another obviously, issue that we spoke about, and that is geographical sales mix. So as we sell more product overseas, so the margin reduces overall, the percentage gross margin reduces overall. And then, as you look at the alcohol business building, the gross margins from that side of the business are less than the gross margins that we enjoy in the energy drink sector. So you've got pluses and minuses, the alcohol brands, you'll see in the Q that will be released in a day or so that the alcohol brands were $60 million of sales, and that margin is lower, and we've reported it as being lower than in the rest of the business. So, overall, there's really is a mix, and then with a Bang product coming in, we expect that the Bang product will have the same margins as the kind of Ultra products in our own portfolio, the Reign products and Ultra products, and that will improve margins. So overall, there's a -- we've got a mix of positive items that are benefiting gross margins and those items that are detracting from gross margins.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you, and good afternoon. Can you comment on where you're seeing the energy category demand perspective, from a consumer standpoint? And then related to that, obviously, congrats on the acquisition of Bang. How are you planning to lean even more into this wellness energy category, with the organic growth through the House Renovation, Rainstorm, in particular continues to grow fast, but now Bang adds more presence into that sub segment. So what are you – what you can share at this point, I know you're going to share more in the next earnings call. But can you talk about how you can participate even more in that category? And if I can squeeze just a clarification about Brazil and Latin America, I think x, Mexico continues to do well. But I was surprised to see a deceleration. I know, it's tough comparison, when you gain a lot of shares in Brazil, but just to make sure that we get those points in. Thank you.
Hilton Schlosberg: So if I talk about the energy category as such, and we started looking at the one week data because the community looks at the one week data, and the energy category is still growing in good double digits 13% in the last week, so we're seeing a good increase in the energy category. And as we look at, traditional energy and wellness energy and performance energy, obviously, you've seen kind of differences within those segments. Interesting, the Bang started off life as a very much performance energy. And today, if you look at the brand, and you analyze what it stands for, really stands for a different segment, which is really lost on energy. So you've got all these different brands that are filling different needs within the energy space. But traditionally, energy is still growing, I did a quick analysis and the traditional energy is still growing and the number I'm looking at is around 10%. You've got this other wellness energy and obviously we are participating in that segment with Rainstorm, yes, which we are really excited about. And then performance energy where we have Reign which is doing very well. The difficulty in, really going deep in -- deep dive into performance energy is that the Bang brand has suffered, because it's lost so much distribution. And that's a factor that obviously is driving that segment of the market. And then quickly, just turning to Brazil, and Chile, the energy category in those countries really grew very rapidly. And we grew extensively within those two countries, but there has been, we've seen a little bit of a slowdown in growth in both Brazil and in Chile. And as you can see, from the numbers that we reported, we are still market leaders. So it's something that is part of doing business within Brazil and in Chile, and we maintaining a market share. And we had a product issue in Chile, which have now been sorted, we bring in product from Mexico, we now are able to produce locally in Chile. But the market has taken somewhat of slowing growth. And, we've been as a market leader, we've been part of that as well.
Operator: The next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi.
Filippo Falorni: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Two clarifications on the Bang acquisition. So first, can you provide us with like, the last 12 months sales for the brand? And then bigger picture like how are you guys planning to position the brand in the US? What consumers are you going after? And then internationally, you mentioned the transition to the coke system in the US, you plan that also to transition international? And if you can give us any timeline on that. Thank you.
Hilton Schlosberg: Maybe I just comment a little bit just, pretty much Hilton, I think covered most of in his last answer. But we are able to look at the brands if you've seen what how the Bank brand has, in fact developed. It was originally in the black can focused, sort of focus on competing with Monster and it then went to a color can and then more recently it went to a white can. And then that white cat has gone through a transition as well. So you then got Reign which is in a black can, and you've got Rainstorm, which is in a 12 ounce white can. And so we see a different way of separating the brands, marketing them differently, and positioning and we think they can all basically fit within our broader portfolio completely separate to NOS which is very much a Motors sort of brand Full Throttle and Monster. So if you look at that packaging, that's how we do it, we're going to probably change the packaging slightly of the Bang brand, but it will remain principally a white can and in a 16 ounce. And so we feel that there is a way which we do -- all these brands can play quite with each other within our portfolio.
Operator: The next question comes from Peter Galbo with Bank of America.
Peter Galbo: Hey, guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess if I can just to follow back up on Peter Grom’s question and understanding you don’t give guidance around gross margin. I guess as we looked at it on a gross profit per case basis. You were actually kind of flattish sequentially. So ignoring the percentage but looking at the dollars, is that at all a better way to think about the go forward as just as you're managing gross profit per case on dollar basis relative to the margin. Thanks very much.
Hilton Schlosberg: So we always look at gross profit per case. When we launch a product that's very much part of the way that this company has always examined new product introductions. So know your costs that phrase has been something that we preached for any number of years. So as we go forward with new products with new innovation, even for example, with a Bang acquisition, knowing the cost is vital to really being able to position a product within our portfolio. Now, obviously, some products have lower gross profits per case, like, for example, the coffee products, but they are an important part of our portfolio. So as we examine products, and we examine where we are, we always have to look at what we are delivering to consumers to meet to their needs, within the overall ambit of a product portfolio. Now, when we went into energy, into alcohol, I'm sorry, we went into alcohol with our eyes wide open, we knew the margins that were in alcohol would be lower than the margins in the energy drink category. So we look at margin, I've always said this on calls, I say we bank dollars, we don't bank percentages. And I've always encouraged analysts to just think, likewise, that we don't bank percentages, we bank dollars.
Operator: The next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities.
Chris Carey: Hey, good afternoon. How you doing? So just one quick follow up there. And then just kind of like a capital allocation question. But would you mind providing the Latin America gross margin on the quarter? I probably missed it or I'm not sure you gave it. But that would be helpful, and just a Latin America in general. So is there a temporary disruption that we're working through? Or is what we're seeing underlying demand? So just those two follow ups? And then I realized this is a multi-part question, I'm probably going to get in trouble. But just from a capital allocation standpoint, when can you start buying back stock again, so thanks so much.
Hilton Schlosberg: So let's talk a little bit about Latin America, remember, we sell to the distributors, and the distributors sell to the retailers. And as the demand is somewhat reduced at retail, the distributors cut back their inventory. So they over inventorize, they cut back. And, unfortunately, we are the recipient of what happens in the distribution channel. So as I said, all of these issues will resolve themselves, because you have these cutbacks, but then we go to a more orderly situation, where we should go to more lean situation in future quarters. And that's where we are in Latin America. The brand is so as I said, very strong. We market leaders in Argentina, we market leaders in Brazil, we market leaders in Chile as very big markets and market leaders in other countries as well. So that's an answer to that. And then, what I would ask you to do is, listen to the conference call, because I don't want to repeat numbers that we've already said, we're already running out of time, the Q will be out in in two days, and that should answer your questions on Latin America.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.
Bonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you. Hi, guys. I just wanted to quickly circle back on gross margins and see if you could share what impacted out of orbit issue that you highlighted during your shareholder meeting, maybe head off margin and whether this issue is now resolved, essentially. And I just want to confirm that you guys are now back working within your orbit.
Hilton Schlosberg: Yes, Bonnie, there always will be anomalies. And we're in the middle of summer, as you know, and it's been pretty hot out there. And we're doing our very best to stay within orbits, but there are anomalies from time to time and our mission in this company has always been to satisfy our customers. So yes, there will be, we maintaining within our orbits, but there are times when we will and we do stray from that. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks.
Rodney Sacks: Thanks very much. On behalf of the company, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. And in particular capitalizing on our relationship with the Coca Cola Bottler system. We believe that we are well positioned in the beverage industry and continue to be optimistic about the future of our company. We hope that you will remain safe and healthy and have enjoyable summer. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may all now disconnect.

The company assumes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you, Tom. The company achieved record first quarter net sales of 1.7 billion in the 2023 first quarter, 11.9% higher than net sales of 1.52 billion in the 2022 comparable period, and 15.3% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 first quarter was 52.8% compared with 51.1% in the comparative 2022 first quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 first quarter as compared to the 2022 first quarter was primarily the result of pricing actions, decreased freight in costs, and decreased aluminum can costs. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased on a sequential quarterly basis to 52.8% in the 2023 first quarter, from 51.8% in the 2022 fourth quarter, and 51.3% in the 2022 third quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, excluding gross profit for the company's alcohol brands segment increased on a sequential quarterly basis to 53.6% in the 2023 first quarter, from 52.5% in the 2022 fourth quarter, and 51.9% in the 2022 third quarter. The depletion of our remaining higher cost imported can inventories will continue over the next few quarters but should be fully utilized during 2023. Operating expenses for the 2023 first quarter were 412.8 million, compared to 377.2 million in the 2022 first quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2023 first quarter, were 24.3% compared with 24.8% in the 2022 first quarter. Distribution expenses for the 2023 first quarter decreased to 76.3 million or 4.5% of net sales, compared to 81.4 million or 5.4% of net sales in the 2022 first quarter. The 5.1 million decrease in distribution expenses was primarily due to decreased freight out expenses of 15.7 million partially offset by higher warehouse expenses of 9.9 million as a result of higher raw materials and finished product inventories in the United States and EMEA. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to increased payroll expenses. We're now purchasing aluminum cans from local sources globally. We have rebuilt finished product inventory levels globally to return to our Orbitz strategy of producing in closer proximity to our customers. The cost of repositioning finished products to distribution centers are included in freight-in costs. The company continues to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment. Operating income for the 2023 first quarter increased 21.4% to 485.1 million from 399.5 million in the 2022 comparative quarter. The effective tax rate for the 2023 first quarter was 20.1% compared with 25% in the 2022 first quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the increase in the stock compensation deduction in the 2023 first quarter. Net income increased 35.1% to 397.4 million as compared to 294.2 million in the 2022 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2023 first quarter increased 36.6% to $0.38 from $0.27 in the first quarter of 2022. Due to continued cost pressures, the company implemented pricing actions in the United States in 2022, as well as in many other international markets in 2022, and in the first quarter of 2023. The company plans to implement additional price increases in a number of other international markets during the remainder of the 2023 year. In the United States, the company implemented an additional price increase on its 18.6 ounce and 24-ounce lines, effective April 1, 2023. We will continue to review further opportunities for pricing actions in order to mitigate inflationary pressures.

Monsters’ market share in value increased 1.7 points to 30% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Predator increased 71.3% and its market share increased 1.7 share points to 5.4%. The Nielsen statistics from Mexico cover single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen for the month of March 2023 compared to March 2022, Monster's retail market sharing value increased in Argentina to 53.5% and in Chile from 36.4% to 42.7%. In Brazil for the month end March 2023, our share increased from 42.1% to 43.9%. Monster Energy is the leading energy brand in value in Argentina, Brazil and Chile. I'd like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country-to-country. According to Nielsen, in the 13th week period until the end of March 2023, once this retail market share in value is compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 14.8% to 15.8% in Belgium, from 18.3% to 20.9%, in the Czech Republic, from 32.4% to 33.4%, in France, from 15% to 16.6% in Germany, from 29.3% to 30.9%, in Great Britain, or 28.2% to 30.4% Italy, from 29.7% to 34.6% in Norway, from 27.9% to 28.7% in the Republic of Ireland, from 38.2% to 39.9% in Spain, and from 15.9% or 18.1% in Sweden.

Net sales to customers outside the U.S. was $622.9 million, 36.7% of total net sales in the 2023 first quarter, compared to 553.4 million or 36.4% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2022. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on net sales in U.S. dollars, by approximately $52 million in the 2023 first quarter, included in reported geographic sales, or our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.

Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the first quarter was 30.7% compared to 29.6% in the same quarter in 2022. We are also pleased that in the 2023 first quarter, Monster gained market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Norway, Republic of Ireland, Spain and Sweden. In Asia Pacific, net sales in the 2023 first quarter increased 11.6% in dollars and increased 22.8% in local currencies over the same period in 2022.

In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in 2023 first quarter increased 30.8% in dollars and increased 40.4% in local currencies over the same period in 2022. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 33% for the 2023 first quarter versus 35.4% in the 2022 first quarter.

We will now provide an update on our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, which will be referred to as VPX, the maker of Bang energy drinks. We previously discussed the trademark infringement arbitration, in which an arbitrator found against VPX and awarded Monster Energy Company or MEC and Orange Bank, Inc., 175 million in damages, attorneys fees and costs and an ongoing 5% royalty on future sales of certain Bang energy product. VPX has appealed the judgment. Additionally, on September 29, 2022, a jury in the United States District Court for the Central District of California returned a verdict awarding MEC approximately 293 million in damages on its claims against VPX for false advertising, misappropriation of trade secrets and interference of Monster's contract over shelf space with certain key retailers. On April 12 2023, the district court granted MECs motion for permanent injunction which amongst other things and joins VPX and former CEO, Jack Owoc from falsely or deceptively claiming that Bang or any other beverages contain creatine or a form of creatine. The parties have completed briefing the remaining post-trial issues. On October 10, 2022, VPX along with certain of its domestic subsidiaries, and affiliates filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the Southern District of Florida. While those proceedings are moving forward, the VPX is undertaken to make interim royalty payments subject to potential claw back in certain circumstances. On February 14, 2023, VPX made its first royalty payment in the amount of approximately 3.6 million. The company will not recognize either award or the royalty payments until such time as they're realized or realizable. As this litigation and bank bankruptcy proceedings are sub-judicate, we will not be answering further questions on those matters on today's call. In the first quarter, we initially launched the Beast Unleashed in six states through a network of beer distributors. We are pleased with the early results and are continuing to expand distribution into additional markets with the goal of being national by the end of the year. Net sales for Beast unleashed during the first quarter were 20.5 million. We recently relaunched Wild Bass and Hard Seltzer with new packaging and great new flavors and taste profiles. We are refreshing the Dale's Beer brand and we'll be introducing Dale's American Light Lager as part of the refresh. We are planning to launch a new flavored malt beverage line within the next few months. Our alcohol beverage innovation pipeline is robust. We look forward to sharing news of additional new product in the near future. We launched the number of new products in the United States in 2023 first quarter. In January 2023, Monster Energy zero sugar was launched at retail. Monster Energy zero sugar is available in 16-ounce cans and was specifically developed as an indistinguishable zero sugar analogue of our original unique Monster Energy green flavor. In February 2023, we launched a new flavor within our highly successful Monster Ultra line with Monster Energy Ultra Strawberry Dreams available in 16-ounce cans. In March 2023, we launched Reign Storm, which is positioned as a line of total wellness energy drinks in 12-ounce sleek cans to address a compelling opportunity in the energy drink category. Reign Storm is available in four flavors, Valencia Orange, Kiwi Blend, Peach Nectarine and Harvest Grape. Also in March, we launched Rehab Monster Wildberry Tea in 16-ounce cans. We are continuing to expand the distribution of Monster Tour Water in still and sparkling variants into additional states. We launched several new SKUs in the first quarter in 2023 in Canada. In February 2023, we launched Monster Ultra Peachy Keen, Punch Monster Ozzy Style Lemonade and Reign Rainbow Sherbet. In March 2023, we launched Monster zero sugar in Canada. There were several new SKUs in the 2023 first quarter in Latin America. In Brazil, we launched Monster Ultra Watermelon. Additionally, we revamped our previous Chaos product into the new Monster Juice Chaotic. In Mexico, Predator [indiscernible] at retail to further expand our affordable energy offerings. In Uruguay, we launched our second Ultra SKU with Monster Ultra Paradise. In Paraguay and Bolivia, we launched our first juice SKU with Monster Juice Manga Loca and additionally in Bolivia, we launched Fury Goldstrike. The first quarter of 2023 in Australia, we launched two Java Monster SKUs, Java Monster Mean Bean and Java Monster Loca Moca. In EMEA, in the first quarter of 2023, we launched Monster Reserve Watermelon, Ultra Gold, Ultra Rosa, Ultra Watermelon, Juicy Ozzy Lemonade and Juice Chaotic in a number of countries. During the 2023, first quarter we also launched additional SKUs of Burn, Predator and Reign in certain countries. In EMEA as part of an ongoing Pan EMEA launch, we expanded the distribution of our Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton 44 Zero Sugar Energy drink to an additional 22 EMEA markets in the first quarter of 2023, will be followed by another eight markets in the second quarter of 2023. During the first quarter of 2023, we launched Monster Ultra Paradise in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. In April 2023, we launched Monster Reserve Watermelon in Japan, we are planning to introduce the Predator brand in additional countries in APAC in the course of 2023. We estimate that on a foreign currency adjusted basis, including the alcohol brand statement, April 2023, sales were approximately 9.9% higher than the comparable April 22 sales and 7.9% higher than April 2022, excluding the alcohol brand segment. We estimate April 2023 sales, including the alcohol brand segment, to be approximately 7.2% higher than in April 2022 and 5.1% higher than in April 2022, excluding the alcohol brands segment. April 2023 had one less selling day compared to April 2022. In this regard, we caution again, that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays for, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributing centers, as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production shared goals. This affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintain inventory levels according to their own internal requirements, which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter, or any future period. In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, the energy category continues to grow globally. Two, we are pleased to report that our pricing actions, which have been implemented to partially mitigate inflationary pressures have not significantly impacted consumer demand. Three, we are seeing improvements in our gross profit margins on a quarterly sequential basis. Four, our AFF Flavor Facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower land costs to our EMEA region. Five, we are enthusiastic for our 2023 new product innovations, notably Monster Energy Zero Sugar, Ultra Strawberry Dreams, Reign Storm and Pure Water in the United States and Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton 44 Zero Sugar in EMEA. We are pleased with the early results from the launch of the Beast Unleashed. We are continuing to expand distribution with the goal of being national by the end of the year. We are excited by the additional alcohol opportunities that the CANarchy acquisition presents. We are pleased with the initial results of our launch of Reign Storm, our new line of Total Wellness energy drinks. Eight, finally, we are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands, and additional number of international countries. I would now like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Peter Grom from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
Peter Grom: So maybe just two quick margin questions, if I may. So, one, I know you don't want to get into guidance, but you continue to comment on the sequential margin performance or improvement. So with pricing, coming in and cost moderating, should we expect to see sequential improvement in gross margin from here as we move through the year? And then, just somewhat related, as we look at selling expense as a percentage of sales today versus 2019? It's down quite a bit. So as we look ahead, is this high single digit rate that we've seen over the past couple of years sustainable? Or would you be looking to take that higher over time, particularly as gross margin begins to improve? Thanks.
Hilton Schlosberg: So addressing your first question on gross margin, as you know, we don't give guidance. But what we can say and what we have said in previous quarters, and where we've spoken about the price increases, we have [rolling] [ph] price increases in EMEA during the whole year. So that will escalate as the year goes through. In the U.S., we had a price increase, as you know, late last year, and we had a price increase on April 1 in larger sizes the 19.2, 18.4 and the 24 ounce can. So that's something that will be reflected continually as the year goes through. In addition, we took up some pricing later on in the year in LATAM and some in LATAM in 2023, as well. In Asia Pacific, we largely took up pricing in Q1 of this year. So they will be a benefit, I believe from pricing as we go through 2023. With regard to costs, that's something that we continue to evaluate. We know that, for example, aluminum has kind of stabilized which is positive for, I think, for us. And we've also had a situation where we've seen freight rates reducing, and we balanced freight in two sections in our P&L trade-in for materials and for finished goods as they move to distribution centers are regarded as part of cost of sales and freight-out is obviously regarded as an operating expense. So we are seeing some improvements. We mentioned, I think on previous calls, and in the script today, that there are some challenges in our cost of sales, including what we're seeing certain ingredients, and co-packing fees. So overall, I think, I could see a situation where we have the price -- we have the price benefits, they seem as if the -- they have been sensibly executed and that we haven't had major resistance from customers. So I think that gives you the background probably to make your own assessment. And then on your second question on selling expenses, we work towards a budget on selling expenses, which we believe are necessary to execute our play. And what those budgets are and where they end up is a factor that we very seriously consider in dealing with the needs of our consumer and the needs of the market. So, we don't really compare it to themselves and at the end of the quarter everybody else does. But we look at the needs of the marketing programs, and what we need to do to keep our brands exciting and in the eyes of the consumers.
Operator: Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi. Please go ahead with your question.
Filippo Falorni: You talked about the energy drink category remaining solid, can you talk about what you're expecting in the balance of the year for the category, are you seeing any signs of potential weakness at the low end of the consumer base, or you're seeing trends held up in the U.S. particularly? Thank you.
Hilton Schlosberg: So we don't give guidance, Rodney, you go ahead and respond to that.
Rodney Sacks: Go ahead.
Hilton Schlosberg: No, please. Now you go ahead, that's fine.
Rodney Sacks: We don't give guidance and the category has in line with other consumer products in a little bit of a slowing, I think there's been a lot of price increases across not only the energy category, but all beverage and consumer product. And so there has been a little bit of slowing, I think there's been a little bit of trimming of benefits under the snap programs that were increased during COVID. And those are sort of being pulled back a little bit generally now. So I think you would see a little bit of a sort of rationalization by buyers as they have slightly less disposable income. But again, I think that will settle down. We are overall though, if you look at the numbers, we gave you the Nielsen numbers, there is still healthy growth in the energy drink category as a category, it's continuing to grow and expand. But other than the direction you're seeing from Nielsen, we really can't, and won't give any further direction. But obviously, we think that certainly in dollar terms, the category will continue to grow. In actual volumes, they may be a little bit of a slowing. But I think that we will think that it'll be more than made above by dollar increases in pricing.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
Bonnie Herzog: I guess I wanted to ask a little bit about some of the innovation, just maybe a little more color on, Zero Sugar, the Beast, Reign Storm, and how they're performing and whether they're meeting your expectations in terms of buy-in from retailers and shelf space allocation. I guess I'm hearing you got a fair amount of incremental space. So just wanted to verify that with you. And then wanted to understand on Zero Sugar in particular, [Technical Difficulty] most of that during Q1 or you still expecting to kind of roll that out in certain market in Q2? Thank you.
Hilton Schlosberg: Okay. So if you look at Zero Sugar, we launched Zero Sugar, we rolled it out in Q1. So most markets by far the majority rolled out Zero Sugar in Q1. As regards Zero Sugar, we have actually been very pleased with the results. We had good expectations for the product and our expectations seem to have been realized. We're not seeing a big dip in green. So a lot of people have asked questions about cannibalization. But we're not seeing a big dip in green at all. I mean, green seems very much to be holding its own. So I think that as we look at shelf space, obviously we've negotiated very actively this year for additional shelf space. And we have achieved really commendable increases in shelf space. Not only in convenience, not only in the convenience independence, but across the various channels.
Rodney Sacks: The only thing I would add is, Bonnie, internationally, we do have plans to also roll up the Zero Sugar into a number of international markets but that it's not going to go everywhere at the same time we have other things on the agenda today need to roll out. So there'll be an orderly rollout of other innovation internationally, but in many markets including in EMEA, we will be rolling up to Zero Sugar as well.
Hilton Schlosberg: Yes. And we just launched in Canada as well. So really exciting times, I think for that particular product.
Rodney Sacks: Now with regard to the expectations, Bonnie's, Reign Storm really was launched right at the end of the first quarter. So it's just too early to tell. But obviously, we are optimistic about it. Again, and with regard to the Beast, we rolled it out slowly. And we are trying to do that in a cautious way. And we so far, the result, sales, some of the repeat sales have also been encouraging. And but again, it's early on, we have a lot of additional innovation in alcohol that we are looking at and planning. So we were quite excited, it just takes time. And we are rolling it out through this whole new distribution system, which we are continuing to build distributed by distributor, so it's taking time to get there. But as we said on the call, we hope to be national, by the end of the year, we hope to have additional product. So the whole system, I think is working, moving forward according to plan.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead with your question.
Chris Carey: Just one clarification or maybe if you can help the 18.6 and the 24 ounce? How meaningful are those as a percentage of your overall portfolio? Or is there just any way to frame the size of that price increase as a contribution to total business? And then, just a bigger picture one, that I feel a little bit, but I get questions pretty often just about succession planning and long-term succession planning on Monster and how strong is the bench, and how much of that bench building is going on behind closed doors. It just comes up enough that, I thought maybe this could be an interesting place to just maybe offer some perspective on just how you think about developing talent and developing talent for the long-term. So, thanks for the -- maybe a little bit of help on the scope of the pricing and just on talent development. Thanks.
Hilton Schlosberg: Chris, I would refer you to the Nielsen numbers. And you'll see that those larger sizes are less than 10%, probably in the 6% to 8% range. But if you look at Nielsen, you'll be able to get a good assessment of that percentage. Secondly, on succession, obviously, the Monster Board is, and Rodney and myself are really concerned about succession. And something that we are addressing, and we continue to address on an ongoing basis. We have a very, in our view, a deep strength in the bench of the team below us that are being developed and are growing and we are helping them develop. So I think from that perspective, it's something that ourselves, the board, are very well aware of. And we'll continue to address that issue. However, I don't think Rodney is going anywhere in the foreseeable future and frankly, neither am I. So we are here and will help develop and segue when the time is right, a new management team.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
Andrea Teixeira: I just have a clarification. So went back to Bonnie's question on how accretive Monster Zero has been against Ultra. In absolute terms in numbers in the U.S. it seems there has been a great launch based on the Nielsen data. But it obviously as you look at Ultra, it also has been coming at some deceleration which Obviously one would expect. Can you comment on who your first of all, how is it tracking against plan? And in terms of shelf productivity that you pointed out that you're gaining distribution and trying to make it obviously accretive? How is it number one tracking against plan. And number two, how you're seeing that, going above and beyond Ultra?
Hilton Schlosberg: Okay. So remember that we had a product called Absolutely Zero. And Zero Sugar is really the new variant of Absolutely Zero. So it's a product that was in the market that has been replaced by Zero Sugar. So when you compare the numbers for Zero Sugar, you can see that on an ACV basis, we moved from 42% from Absolutely Zero to 72%, for Zero Sugar. So the distribution of Zero Sugar is increasing, and it's climbing. It's not that it's a new product. We had, as I said, a product called Absolutely Zero. And so when we look at Zero Sugar, we look at our plans, we look at our plans for Ultra, we have been very satisfied so far, with the launch of Zero Sugar. You look at the ACV growth. And the sales per point and it's something that we really as -- and I said this earlier, we really are very excited with Zero Sugar.
Rodney Sacks: Just maybe I will just add on the Ultra side. We have had a really successful launch of Ultra Strawberry Dreams. I think that some of the ACV, if you look at your Nielsen's, you'll see some of the ACV or some of the additional flavors Ultra -- Ultra Heavy in fact decreased a little bit. I think that's something we just need to look at and attend, I think as you get go through this change and introducing of new flavor, sometimes -- some of these additional SKUs that are not the top three, or four or five, sometimes get a little bit lost in the wash. So that's where we've seen a little bit of a drop-off in some of those additional flavors. But I think there's -- we think that there are solid and sound products and I think, we just need -- just really make sure we focus on just reestablishing some of the distribution levels on those. And we think those sales will continue to increase. Sales of Ultra as a brand or sub-brand have gone up in the United States and internationally. But I think that we've had, as I said, some of those flanker sort of flavors are, we need to just put some focus behind which we are doing.
Operator: And our next question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.
Mark Astrachan: Two housekeeping questions. One cash balance, it keeps growing. Any thoughts on how you'd like to implement spending some of it share repurchase? It was nice to see there were some interest income this quarter, I assume we shouldn't be thinking to that continues to grow. And then, on the alcohol brands gross margin, the implied number this quarter was a little better sequentially than 4Q, anything is there kind of beneath the surface that we should consider and trying to model that business because it's clearly a lot harder to see what's going on there. And then sort of the legacy business. Thanks.
Rodney Sacks: On the alcohol side, I think that what we did was -- we had quite a drop off in the seltzer business that which is part of the brands that we acquired, and that affected in operating business where they're running their own production that affected their overhead costs, because you've got some fixed costs. So as you noted in the earlier, last quarter of last year, we reported on the margins were really very [indiscernible] on the -- what we call the legacy business. Those margins are improving. We're busy sort of refitting the one line out to be able to increase the capacity for doing the Beast products. And as we go forward, we will start seeing an improvement in the margin in the legacy business. The margins on the Beast side are healthier, quite a lot better than on the legacy craft business side. And as again, those are probably smaller, lower now than they'll be as we start of getting some scale, we are doing some co-packing, we will be using our own facility and we will obviously be maximizing that. And as we go forward, we will start working on using additional co-pack as we will actually lower our costs. So we do think there will be additional margin going forward, but it is a thinner margin product, and we obviously are traditionally used to seeing on the Monster side. And maybe Hilton, you want to take the question on the cash side. Go ahead.
Hilton Schlosberg: Mark, we continually are examining options to deal with our cash balances, and it's something that, again, is a board issue that is receiving attention. So, I really don't want to comment, more than we have that -- intention is to hopefully buy back shares continue that program. But we are looking at -- some opportunities for further investments. And that's too premature to talk about them. But there are a number of possibilities that that we're looking at. And in addition, it is our plan to continue buying back our shares.
Endof Q&A:
Operator: And, at this time, we'll be concluding today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you, all for the company. I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy. And we remain committed to continuing to innovate, to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. And in particular, capitalizing on our relationship with the Coca-Cola Bottlers System.

And thank you for your attendance.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-28 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Corporation Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, today’s event is being recorded. I’d now like to turn the conference over to Rodney Sacks and Hilton Schlosberg, Co-CEOs for Monster Beverage. Please go ahead.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I’m Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, is on the call; as is Tom Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom Kelly will now read our cautionary statement.
Tom Kelly: Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2022, and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, including the sections contained therein entitled, the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements, for a discussion on specific risk and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you, Tom. The company achieved record fourth quarter net sales of $1.51 billion in the 2022 fourth quarter, 6.2% higher than net sales of $1.43 billion in the 2021 comparable period and 11.9% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent global supply chain challenges and disruptions, the company has prioritized product availability for its consumers and customers, despite adversely impacting gross margins and operating income. The company continues to stand by its strategy to ensure product availability and solidify the continued long-term growth of the company's brands. CANarchy was acquired in February 2022 to facilitate the company's entry into the alcohol beverage sector. During 2022, CANarchy sustained margin pressures, cost of acquisition and integration, as well as certain other costs in preparation for the launch of the company's new alcohol product lines. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 fourth quarter was 51.8% compared with 53.9% in the comparative 2021 fourth quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 fourth quarter as compared to the 2021 fourth quarter was primarily the result of: one, increased ingredients and other input costs, including secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees; two, geographical and product sales mix; and three, increased logistical costs. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 fourth quarter was partially offset by pricing actions. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased on a sequential quarterly basis to 51.8% in the 2022 fourth quarter from 51.3% in the 2022 third quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, excluding gross profit for the company's Alcohol Brands segment increased on a sequential quarterly basis to 52.5% in the 2022 fourth quarter from 51.9% in the 2022 third quarter. We continue to believe that some of these increased costs we are experiencing are likely to be transitory. The depletion of our remaining higher cost imported can inventories will continue over the next few quarters and should be fully utilized during 2023. We note that our major promotion in the fourth quarter was executed with lower-cost, locally sourced cans in the United States and globally. We estimate that of the increasing costs of sales in the 2022 fourth quarter, approximately $60 million, was comprised of one, approximately $39.6 million due to increased ingredient and other input costs, including primary and secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees; two, approximately $12.5 million due to geographical and product sales mix; and three, approximately $7.9 million due to increased logistical costs. We continue to experience significant increases in distribution expenses, primarily the result of increased warehousing expenses as well as other logistical expenses, which adversely impacted operating expenses. The company continues to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment. We are starting to see a reduction in freight rates in the United States. Operating expenses for the 2022 fourth quarter was $390 million compared with $354.7 million in the 2021 fourth quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2022 fourth quarter were 25.8% compared with 24.9% in the 2021 fourth quarter and 28.9% in the 2019 fourth quarter pre-COVID. Distribution expenses for the 2022 fourth quarter increased to $76.1 million which is an increase of 9% or 5% of net sales compared to $69.8 million or 4.9% of net sales in the 2021 fourth quarter and 3.5% of net sales in the 2019 fourth quarter pre-COVID. The $6.3 million increase in distribution expenses was primarily due to higher warehouse expenses of $11.2 million as a result of higher raw materials and finished product inventories in the United States and EMEA, partially offset by decreased freight out expenses of $4.4 million. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to increased payroll expenses and increased general and administrative expenses. We are now able to purchase aluminum cans from local sources globally. We have seen a reduction in cost of sales through increased use of domestic cans, as we continue to cycle through existing inventories of imported cans over the next few quarters. We have rebuilt finished product inventory levels globally to return to our Orbitz strategy of producing closer proximity to our customers. The cost of repositioning finished products to distribution centers are included in freight-in costs. Operating income for the 2022 fourth quarter decreased 4.5% to $394.4 million from $412.9 million in the 2021 comparative quarter. Net income decreased 6.1% to $301.7 million, as compared to $321.3 million in the 2021 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2022 fourth quarter decreased 4.9% to $0.57 from $0.60 in the fourth quarter of 2021. Diluted earnings per share, exclusive of the Alcohol segment operating losses and the adverse impacts of foreign currency exchange rates, net of tax, was $0.64 in the 2022 fourth quarter. Through pricing actions, the company was able to achieve positive pricing appreciation in the United States and EMEA. Due to continued cost pressures, the company implemented a net sales price increase in the range of 6% market-wide in the United States effective September 1, 2022, and will be implementing a price increase on its 24-ounce line effective April 1, 2023. The company also implemented price increases in the second half of 2022 in certain international markets and will be implementing additional price increases on a phased approach during the first half of 2023 in a number of international markets. The company will continue to review further opportunities for price increases and pricing actions in order to mitigate inflationary pressures. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through February 11, 2023, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including energy shots increased by 13.1% versus the same period a year ago.

According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended February 11, 2023, sales in dollars in the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased 15.1% over the same period the previous year.

Sales of Monster, including Java Monster 300 and Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew were 8.1% higher in the same period versus the previous year. Sales of Starbucks Energy were 8% higher. Java Monster's share including Java Monster 300, Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew of the coffee plus energy category, which primarily includes Java Monster, Java Monster 300, Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew, Starbucks Doubleshot and Tripleshot, Rockstar Roasted and Bang Keto Coffee for the four weeks ended February 11, 2023, was 54.7%, up 1 point while Starbucks Energy share was 44.9%, up 0.8 of a point.

According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category increased 26.6% for the month of January 2023. Monster sales increased 34.1%. Monster's market share in value increased 1.7 points to 29.4% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Predator increased 106.2%, and its market share increased 2 share points to 5.1%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover a single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen for the month of December 2022 compared to December 2021, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 43% to 53.5%, in Chile, from 34.5% to 41.7%. In Brazil for the month end January 2023, our share increased from 39.9% to 41.1%. Monster is the leading energy brand in value in Argentina, Brazil and Chile. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until the end of January 2023, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 14.2% to 15.2% in Belgium, from 30.7% to 31.8% in France from 29.5% to 31% in Great Britain, from 27.3% to 32.7% in Norway, from 27.7% to 27.8% in the Republic of Ireland, from 38.6% to 40.4% in Spain and from 15.1% to 16.5% in Sweden.

Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year declined from 14.6% to 13.9% in Germany, from 38.1% to 36.8% increase and from 19% to 18.3% in Poland.

Live+ market share in value decreased from 6.7% to 6.1%, and Mother's market share in value increased from 5.8% to 6%. According to INTAGE in Japan in the month of ending December 2022, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 53.7% to 54.7%. According to Nielsen in South Korea in the month ending December 23 to Monster's market share in value in all after it's combined as compared to the same period the previous year, increased from 60.2% to 64.2%. Again, point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or four week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. Net sales to customers outside the US were $542.5 million, 35.9% of total net sales in the 2022 fourth quarter compared to $508.1 million or 35.7% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2021. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on net sales in US dollars by approximately $81.9 million in the 2022 fourth quarter. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the US, transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA, net sales in the 2022 fourth quarter decreased 2.3% in dollars, but increased 14.7% in local currencies over the same period in 2021. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales in the fourth quarter, was 33.9% compared with 32.6% in the same quarter in 2021 and compared to 34.7% in the third quarter of 2022. The company is continuing to address the controllable challenges in this supply chain in EMEA. We're also pleased that in the 2022 fourth quarter, Monster gained market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Italy, Norway, the Republic of Ireland, Spain and Sweden. In Asia-Pacific, net sales in 2022 fourth quarter increased 0.5 point in dollars and increased 20.6% in local currencies over the same period in 2021. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 42.6% versus 41.4% over the same period in 2021. Due in part to a product supply issue with an ingredient that impacted a number of our products in Japan, but has now been resolved, net sales in the 2022 fourth quarter decreased 14.4% in dollars, but increased 10% in local currency. Sales in the 2022 fourth quarter continued to be impacted by COVID in certain channels. In South Korea, net sales increased 13.9% in dollars and increased 34.4% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter in 2021. Once the remains -- in China, sales volume in the fourth quarter increased 5.4%, as compared to the same quarter in 2021, largely impacted by COVID-related lockdowns. We remain optimistic about the prospects for the Monster brand in China. In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 2.9% in dollars and 16.7% in local currencies. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the 2022 fourth quarter increased 45.2% in dollars and increased 57.7% in local currencies over the same period in 2021. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 28.4% for the 2022 fourth quarter versus 38.6% in the 2021 fourth quarter.

Net sales in Argentina increased 92% in dollars and increased 196.6% in local currency in the 2022 fourth quarter. We will now provide an update on our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which will be referred to as VPX, the maker of Bang energy drinks. We previously discussed the trademark infringement arbitration in which an arbitrator found against VPX and awarded Monster Energy Company, or MEC and Orange Bank, $175 million in damages, attorney fees and costs and an ongoing 5% royalty on future sales of certain Bang energy products. VPX has appealed the judgment. Additionally, on September 29, 2022, a jury in the United States District Court for the Central District of California returned a verdict awarding MEC approximately $293 million in damages on its claims against VPX for false advertising, misappropriation of trade secrets and interference with Monster's contracts over shelf space with certain key retailers. The parties are briefing post-trial issues. On October 10, 2022, VPX, along with certain of its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the Southern District of Florida. While those proceedings are moving forward, VPX has undertaken to make interim royalty payments subject to potential claw-backs in certain circumstances. On February 14, 2023, VPX made its first royalty payment in the amount of approximately $3.6 million. The company will not recognize either award or the royalty payments until such time as they are realized or realizable. As the litigation and bankruptcy proceedings are subjudicate, we will not be answering further questions on those matters on today's call. In the first quarter of 2023, we launched The Beast Unleashed in six states through a network of beer distributors. The Beast Unleashed is a flavored malt beverage with 6% alcohol by volume based on Monster's well-known and popular flavor profiles. We are pleased with early results and plan to expand into additional markets in the second quarter of 2023, with the goal of being national by the end of the year. We recently launched Wild Basin Hard Seltzer with new packaging and great new flavors and taste profiles. The Dale's Beer family will get a refresh in the second quarter of 2023, including the introduction of Dale's American light lager and easy-drinking lager with 4.2% alcohol by volume, 95 calories and 2.5 carbohydrates per 12-ounce serving. Our alcohol beverage innovation pipeline is robust. We look forward to sharing use of additional new products in the future. In the 2022 fourth quarter in the United States, Monster Reserve Orange Dreamsicle was launched at retail to expand our Monster Reserve line. Monster Energy Zero Sugar was launched at retail in United States in January 2023. Monster Energy Zero Sugar was specifically developed as an indistinguishable zero sugar analog of our original unique Monster Energy Green flavor. We are excited about the opportunities that this product will provide to our Monster consumers who have come to enjoy the unique taste profile of our original Monster Green flavor, which remains our leading flavor. Earlier this month, we also launched Monster Energy Ultra Strawberry Dreams, Monster Reserve Kiwi Strawberry, Monster Nitro Cosmic Peach and Java Monster Cafe Latte. Initial response from consumers has been positive. In February 2023, we launched the flavor of Reign called Tropical Storm in the United States and also commenced with the launch of Monster Tour Water, a pure unflavored water line in still and sparkling variants in 19.2 ounce cans. We are planning to launch Reign Storm, which is positioned as a total wellness energy drink in 12-ounce sleek cans at retail in March 2023 in four flavors to address a compelling opportunity in the energy drink category. We launched several new SKUs in October in Latin America. In Chile, we expanded our Ultra line by launching Ultra Gold and Ultra Watermelon. In Mexico, we introduced Monster Energy Reserve Watermelon. In Puerto Rico, the Cayman Islands, Curico and Bermuda, we expanded our Reign portfolio and launched Reign White Gummy Bear and Reign Rainbow Sorbet. In Trinidad and Tobago, we launched Monster Pipeline Punch. In Australia, we expanded our core portfolio and launched Monster Super Dry. In New Zealand, we expanded our juice portfolio and launched Monster Juice Papillon, which is currently exceeding our expectations. In EMEA, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we launched Monster Nitro, Monster Reserve Watermelon and White Pineapple in a number of countries. In certain countries, we also launched juiced Aussie Lemonade, Ultra Gold, Ultra Rosa and Ultra Watermelon during the 2022 fourth quarter. During the 2022 fourth quarter, we also launched additional SKUs of Burn and Reign in certain countries. In EMEA as part of an ongoing plan, EMEA launch, we commenced distribution of our Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton 44 Zero Sugar Energy drink in select EMEA markets late in the fourth quarter of 2022 to be followed by an additional 25 EMEA markets in the first quarter of 2023. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we launched Monster Rehab Lemon tea in Japan, Monster Ultra Watermelon in Turkey. Monster Ultra Paradise in Vietnam, Predator in Malaysia, and we continued the national rollout of Predator India. We are planning to introduce the Predator brand in additional countries in APAC during the course of 2023. We estimate that on a foreign currency adjusted basis, including CANarchy, January 2023 sales were approximately 16.1% higher than the comparable January 2022 sales and 13.8% higher than January 2022, excluding CANarchy. We estimate January 2023 sales, including CANarchy to be approximately 12.9% higher than in January 2022 and 10.6% higher than in January 2022, excluding CANarchy. January 2023 had the same number of selling days as January 2022. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules. This affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partner maintained inventory levels according to their own internal requirements, which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continues in certain regions, our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed. On November 2, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional 500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. During the 2022 fourth quarter, the company purchased approximately 2.3 million shares of its common stock for a total amount of $201.6 million, excluding broker commissions under the June 2022 repurchase plan, leaving approximately 682.8 million remaining available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase programs. The company today announced that its Board of Directors has approved and declared a 2-for-1 split of its common stock that will be effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend. Each stockholder of record on March 13, 2023, will receive a dividend of one additional share of common stock for each then held share to be distributed after the close of trading on March 27, 2023. The company anticipates its common stock to begin trading at the split adjusted price on March 28, 2023. In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, the energy category continues to grow globally; two, the company has increased its raw material and finished product inventories to better service customers and ensure availability of its products. Three, we are seeing improvement in our gross profit margins on a quarterly sequential basis due to supply chain normalization; four, our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower land costs to our EMEA region. Five, we are enthusiastic for only 23 new product innovations notably Monster Energy Zero Sugar, which launched in January 2023 in the United States and Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton 44 Zero sugar energy drink in EMEA. We are also particularly enthusiastic for the planned launches of rainstorm in March 2023 as well as Tour Water in the United States. We are pleased with the early results from the launch of The Beast Unleashed, our first flavored malt beverage alcohol product in six states and the planned rollout to additional states, as well as the additional alcohol opportunities that the CANarchy acquisition presents. Seven, we are planning to launch Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in additional international countries. And finally, we are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in an additional number of international countries. I would now like to open the floor to questions about the year. Thank you.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Peter Grom of UBS. Please go ahead.
Peter Grom: Thanks, operator, and good evening or good afternoon everyone. So, Hilton, I guess, I wanted to ask about gross margin. You mentioned in the release that you expect some of these cost pressures you’ve experience to be transitory, whereas others remain challenging. And I guess maybe just to start, is there any way to frame how much of the drag on gross margin is still a result of these imported cans? And then just looking ahead in the context of pricing, the cost backdrop you've outlined and kind of the modest sequential improvement we saw sequentially, how would you frame the margin recapture opportunity looking out to next year? Thanks.
Hilton Schlosberg: Okay. Well, if you look back at what happened in the fourth quarter, we had a price increase in September 1 in the US. We had some price increases internationally during 2022 and into the fourth quarter of 2022. We are increasing pricing in many international markets on a phased basis starting in the early part of 2023. So, a lot of the increased costs that we have been absorbing should be accommodated by increased pricing. But looking forward, we all know what's happening with aluminum. It's coming down. Certain other commodities are coming down. In Europe, we see energy coming down. So overall, I think with regard to margin, we are actually in a good place. And as you saw in this quarter, we were able to move margin on a sequential basis. We do, however, have certain costs that are not going away. For example, co-packing fees have gone up. The sugar is in tight supply because of weather situations. So, there are positives as well as negatives in the system. As regards to the international cans, we don't have that significant quantity left in terms of what the impact will be on gross margin. So, I think we've just got to work through those cans. They are green and ultra-white. We'll look through them and will be good. The only issue is that we do have promotional cans from time to time. And as I've spoken on this call on a number of occasions, these cans are not promotional cans. They're just straight cans that we use in non-promotional periods. And also, it depends -- we have other obligations with our can companies. So, it's a question of sourcing cans on the most optimal place to be able to co-pack. So that may be too long an explanation, but I hope it gave you a sense of what we're seeing from the sand.
Operator: The next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Chris Carey: Hi everyone. So, I just wanted to follow-up on that, but then ask question. So, Hilton, would you expect sequential gross margin improvement from here on steady clip just given pricing and some improvement in commodities or overall cost inflation. I appreciate there are other inflationary factors. But would you expect to continue to sequentially improve from here? So that's just a follow-up. But then from a US perspective, I think one of the things that's coming up tonight is, you had mid-single-digit pricing to high-single-digit pricing in the US in September and yet US sales were 6%. So, can you talk to any -- was there any pull forward of demand because of the pricing actions? Were there any promotions in the quarter behind the pricing? Maybe can you just help reconcile the revenue growth in the quarter in the US, which is basically in line with the pricing that you're taking? So, thanks for that follow-up on gross margins in the US comment.
Hilton Schlosberg: Okay. Chris, to answer your first question, we don't give guidance. And I actually gave quite a robust explanation of what we see the runway for margins. So, I just really don't want to estimate it because we really don't give guidance. But I think I gave you a good sense of where we are, probably too much, but that is where it is. In respect of the price increase in the US in September, we actually limited the bottlers to the extent of how much they could buy in. So, I don't think that there was -- in fact, we don't think there was any much pull forward from Q3. I think it was just a question of the market stabilizing. As you know, with when price increases are put into effect, there's always a little bit of a bump as you go into more steady waters. And everything we know and that we've heard is the price really -- the price increase is actually sticking. So, we had a little bit more promotional allowances in the fourth quarter, and you'll see that in the K is released, but that's really consistent with bleeding in a price increase to a market in the consumer goods industry.
Rodney Sacks: I think the only other thing I would like to just -- maybe just to add on that is that towards the end of the fourth quarter, I think we were not alone. I think there was a number of companies felt some softness in the consumer pool in -- primarily in December. But that was -- and that happened. And then we think we've seen an uptick again in January as we've indicated from our January numbers and you can see from the Nielsen numbers. So, it probably was a little bit of a combination of just an initial hesitancy from consumers to the price increase and then ultimately just some consumer softness, but that seems to have remedies itself in the first quarter now?
Operator: The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.
Drew Levine: Hi. Thank you. This is Drew Levine on for Andrea. Thank you for taking our questions. So, Ron, I want to continue on that point on the sort of rebound in January, and it also seemed like there was an acceleration for both Monster and the category on a three-year stack or three year CAGR basis. So just wondering what you're sort of attributing that underlying strength in consumption too, do you think it's the new product launches, increased interest in the category, gas prices coming down? So, any thoughts around that would be helpful. Thank you.
Rodney Sacks: I think it's a combination of those things. I think we have got gas prices coming down. I think we have seen sort of now sort of increase in convenience. I remember, last year. Convenience was always ahead of the grocery and mass channels. And last year has sort of reversed, and convenience was a little slow. That seems to be coming back a little bit. And we just think that, again, pricing has sort of settled down a bit. But you can see across the whole category, there has been an increase in the Nielsen numbers across the category for most people and our competitors. So, we're just are seeing just a little bit of resurgence of confidence again.
Hilton Schlosberg: Yes, the other thing I think you should do is have a look at the -- when we announced third quarter results, we spoke about the October sales. And if you look at the October sales, it's not inconsistent with the quarter. And I'll talk about the fourth quarter of 2022, sorry.
Operator: The next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Mark Astrachan: Yes, thanks, and good afternoon. So hopefully, you're doing all right there, Rodney.
Rodney Sacks: Yes, I’m fine. Just sort of remnants of a cough for the last couple of weeks.
Mark Astrachan: All right. That's good. Two questions for you. One sort of related to the recent line of questioning. So, inventories were up again sequentially. How do we think about the improvement there? And does that kind of lead into flow-through of improvement in gross margin through 2023? And maybe more bigger picture, how do you think about the relative affordability of Monster and energy drinks broadly in the US after the price increase? It seems like you think that other beverage categories. Pricing has been steady riser over the last decade plus, so the gap has sort of narrowed. You took a little bit of pricing, but not nearly as much on a cumulative basis. Is there opportunity here to become more price rationale from an energy category standpoint as you kind of move forward?
Hilton Schlosberg: Well, let's talk about the first question, Mark, about inventories. As you know, when we went out of 2021, our inventories were just too low. We were unable to service our customers without major upheavals and without major costs. So, we -- there was no question that the inventories had to move and move significantly up because bearing in mind where our sales are. But as we are, we believe that we have sufficient inventories, which is important for us to be able to service our customers. Are we working on getting those inventories down? Yes. And these inventories will optimize themselves in due course. So, I wouldn't be concerned. Our products have a two-year shelf life, and it's important that we maintain sufficient inventories to service our customers. And then on that second question you asked about pricing, if you know and look, for example, at a Mountain Dew at Walmart, a 20-ounce Mountain Dew Walmart, their price is $2.18. And Monster is $2.28, so we -- I think as you look at the energy category and you kind of balance the pricing of 20-ounce sodas and energy drinks. Remember that we now -- and just twisting over to convenience, we sell more -- energy drink sell more at convenience than carbonated soft drinks. So, there is a balance. And I think we have struck a very good balance. With regard to going forward, we have a price increase planned for 24-ounce, which we believe has got opportunity, and we're taking price in 24-ounce up beginning of April. So that will happen. And we'll continue to monitor the opportunities for price increases in the US, as we see margins and as we see the carbonated soft drink category, and it's a whole bundle of issues that lead us to move in the direction of whether to take price.
Operator: The next question comes from Filippo Falorni of Citi. Please go ahead.
Filippo Falorni: Hey. Good afternoon, guys.
Rodney Sacks: Hi.
Filippo Falorni: Can you talk about your expectations for your innovation pipeline in 2023, particularly on a relative basis over the last couple of years, given it seems like you have a pretty substantial pipeline this year, both in alcoholic beverage and your core energy drinks? Thank you.
Rodney Sacks: The fact is that I think that we've actually got a really broad base of innovation, I think that it has sort of improved over the last few years, and I think we're sort of getting it right. I think that will be positive for the brand. We also are being able to secure a little more shelf space across the different channels, which is helping us with innovation, because in some cases, we didn't get shelf spaces in some of the years past, and it was sort of difficult to actually get the innovation to achieve the benefits that we had hoped for. We think that this year, we will be able to achieve those benefits. We have rationalized some of the SKUs. And we think that we'll be able to get a good selection of our innovation on shelf, particularly the new energy Zero Sugar and also the new Reign subline, which will going to go up against other competitors in the 12-ounce category. And there has been some additional shelf space, not only in the energy category, but also in the sort of wellness category. So, I think in some places, we'll also be able to place the Reign Storm sort of line in that area as well. So overall, we think there will be a good contribution going forward from innovation, which is exciting. And so far, initial response to things like our Ultra Strawberry Dreamsicle has been really positive from consumers and bottlers to the Zero Sugar and others. So, we are pretty optimistic and upbeat about innovation this year. Also, we were introducing a lot of multipacks to try and increase the take home, particularly in places like grocery. So again, we haven't described them that much on this call, but there's a whole skew of multipack and variety packs that we're doing in a multipack, which we think will be positive for the brand this year for sales.
Operator: The next question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Steve Powers: Hey. Thanks, and good evening. Just I guess a couple of cleanups on the gross margin topic. The first one is, Rodney, I think at the start of the call, you bridged to a $60 million increase in COGS. I just wanted to clarify what that was. I think if I'm not mistaken, COGS is up like $70 million-plus. So just exactly what those numbers were and what they weren't, number one? Number two, I don't know if you can comment on the mix of cans in the fourth quarter, old higher cost cans versus current cost cans and if that was materially different than what you had seen in the third quarter? And then three, the Latin America gross margin, you called out, sales growth there is fantastic, but the gross margin has been progressively under pressure and was down, I think, 10-plus points in the fourth quarter. Just the drivers there and if you think you've got the ability to turn that gross margin progress around in Latin America? Thank you.
Hilton Schlosberg: I think, Steve, we spoke about that about margins earlier on the call. Margins on a sequential basis were actually up. So, I'm really not sure what you're referring to. And the first question that we answered spoke -- I spoke quite heavily about the progression of gross margins and the pluses and the minuses. So maybe I'm missing something, but I think we did discuss margin earlier on the call. And with regard to the $60 million that we spoke about in the release, that was only -- the $60 million was comprised of $39.6 million due to increased ingredients in other input costs and 12.5 due to geographical product sales mix and 7.9 due to increased logistical costs. And the rest of the increase in cost of sales was normal increases as you would expect to -- in a normal business environment. Those are the kind of the exceptional ones that we called out.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks.
Rodney Sacks: Thanks. On behalf of the company, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad and in particular, capitalizing on our relationship with the Coca-Cola bottling system. We believe that we are well positioned in the beverage industry and continue to be optimistic about the future of our company. We hope that you remain safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-11-03 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Third Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, today's event is being recorded.  At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Rodney Sacks and Hilton Schlosberg. Gentlemen, please go ahead.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, is on the call; as is Tom Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom Kelly will now read our cautionary statement.
Tom Kelly: Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and are based on currently available information regarding expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends as well as the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's business and operations. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2022, including the sections contained therein entitled, Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements, for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you, Tom. The company achieved record third quarter net sales of $1.62 billion in the 2022 third quarter, 15.2% higher than net sales of $1.41 billion in the 2021 comparable period and 20.2% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent increased demand for the company's energy drinks, the company prioritized ensuring product availability for its customers and consumers. This strategic direction has remained in place throughout the global supply chain challenges and disruptions, despite adversely impacting the company's profitability. The company continues to stand by its strategy to ensure product availability and solidify the continued long-term growth of the company's brands. During the 2022 third quarter, the company experienced a significant increase in cost of sales relative to the comparative 2021 third quarter, primarily due to increased ingredient and other input costs, including secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees, increased logistical costs, increased aluminum can costs and geographical and product sales mix. We continue to believe that some of these increased costs we are experiencing are likely to be transitory. The depletion of our higher cost imported cans will continue over the next few quarters. However, our main promotion in the third quarter was executed with lower-cost, locally sourced cans in the United States and globally.  We estimate that of the increasing cost of sales in the 2022 third quarter, approximately $84.2 million was comprised of approximately $40. 1 million due to increased ingredient and other input costs, including secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees to approximately $24.4 million due to increased freight rates and fuel costs, including costs relating to the importation of aluminum cans; 3, approximately $11.5 million due to increased aluminum can costs attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing; and 4, approximately $8. 2 million due to geographical and product sales mix. We continue to air freight quantities of certain ingredients internationally, particularly to EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America at additional costs and inefficiencies to enable timely innovation launches. We continue to experience significant increases in distribution expenses, primarily as a result of increased warehousing expenses as well as other logistical expenses, which adversely impacted operating expenses. The company continues to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 third quarter was 51. 3% compared with 55.9% in the 2021 third quarter, and 47.1% for the 2022 second quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 third was partially offset by pricing actions, including the implementation of our general price increase in the United States effective September 1, 2022, price increases in certain international markets and reductions in promotions. Such pricing actions positively impacted gross profit margins in the 2022 third quarter. Operating expenses for the 2022 third quarter were $415.8 million compared with $344.7 million in the 2021 third quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2022 third quarter were 25.6% compared to 24.4% in the 2021 third quarter and 24.5% in the 2019 third quarter pre-COVID.  Distribution expenses for the 2022 third quarter increased to $83 million, which is an increase of 27.1% or 5.1% of net sales compared to $65.3 million or 4. 6% of net sales in the 2021 third quarter and 3. 3% of net sales in the 2019 third quarter pre-COVID. The $17.7 million increase in distribution expenses was primarily due to higher warehouse expenses of $11.7 million as a result of higher raw materials and finished product inventories in the United States and EMEA as well as increased freight out expenses of $4.8 million as a result of higher outbound freight rates and fuel, increased volume and out-of-orbit freight. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to increased payroll expenses, increased expenditures for sponsorships and endorsements and increased expenditures for travel and entertainment. Certain of these increases were the result of the company's return to activities consistent with pre-COVID-19 levels. We have decreased our reliance on imported cans and are currently purchasing aluminum cans from local sources globally. We have seen a reduction in cost of sales through increased use of domestic cans as we continue to cycle through existing inventories of imported cans over the next few quarters. We have rebuilt and increased finished product inventory levels across the United States and the EMEA to reduce the excessive cost of long distance freight, satisfy demand and to return to our strategy of producing in closer proximity to our customers. The cost of repositioning finished products to distribution centers are included in the freight in costs. Operating income for the 2022 third quarter decreased 6% to $417.9 million from $444.5 million in the 2021 comparative quarter. Net income decreased 4.4% to $322.4 million as compared to $337.2 million in the 2021 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2022 third quarter decreased 3.9% and to $0.60 from $0.63 in the third quarter of 2021. Through pricing actions, the company was able to achieve positive pricing appreciation in the United States and in EMEA. Due to continued cost pressures, the company implemented a net sales price increase in the range of 6% market-wide in the United States, effective September 1, 2022. In addition to price increases or pricing actions taken earlier this year in order to mitigate inflationary cost pressures, the company implemented price increases in the second half of 2022 in certain international markets and will be implementing additional price increases early in 2023 in a number of international markets. The company will continue to review further opportunities for price increases and pricing actions in order to mitigate inflationary pressures. According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through October 22, 2022, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 11. 2% versus the same period a year ago.

The company has regained market share leadership in the energy drink category in the United States for the 13 weeks ended October 22, '19 -- sorry, 2022. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended October 2022, sales in dollars in the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars increased 10. 4% over the same period the previous year. Sales of the company's energy brands, which include Reign, increased 11.8% in the 4-week period in the convenience and gas channel. Sales of Monster increased by 11.4% over the same period versus the previous year. Reign sales increased 12%, NOS was up 13. 9% and Full Throttle was up 7.1%. Sales of Red Bull were up 6. 2%, Rockstar was up 8.1%, and 5-Hour was down 2.2%. VPX Bang sales decreased 27. 3%. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended October 22, 2022, the company's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars increased 0. 5 point to 36.9%. Monster share increased from 30.8% a year ago to 31. 1%, Reign share remained at 2.4%, NOS share increased 0.1% to 2.5%, and Full Throttle share remained at 0.7%. Red Bull share decreased 1.4 points from 37.5% a year ago to 36. 1%. VPX Bang share decreased 2.5 points to 4.8%, 5-Hour share was lower by 0. 5 point at 4%. Rockstar share was down with 0.1 to 3.7%. CELSIUS' share is 2. 6%, Alani new share is 0.6%, and GHOST's share is 1.8%. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended October 22, 2022, sales in dollars of the coffee plus energy drink category, which includes our Java Monster line in the convenience and gas channel increased 11.4% over the same period the previous year. Sales of Java Monster, including Java Monster 300 and Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew, were 10.4% higher in the same period versus the previous year. Sales of Starbucks Energy were 17.4% higher, Java Monster share, including Java Monster 300 and Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew of the coffee plus energy category, which primarily includes Java Monster, Java Monster 300, Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew, Starbucks Doubleshot and Tripleshot, Rockstar Roasted and Bang Keto Coffee for the 4 weeks ended October 22, 2022, was 52.1%, down 0.5 point, while Starbucks Energy share was 46.9%, up 2.4 points. According to Nielsen, in all measured channels in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended October 8, 2022, the energy drink category increased 15.8% in dollars. Sales of the company's energy drink brands increased 14.9% versus a year ago. The market share of the company's energy drink brands was 40.9%, down 0.3 point. Monster sales increased 17. 3%, and its market share increased 0. 5 point to 36.6%. NOS' sales decreased 11.6%, and its market share decreased 0.4 point to 1.3%.

According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category increased 26% for the month of September 2022. Monster sales increased 36.4%. Monster's market share in value increased 2. 2 points to 28.6% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Predator increased 94% and and its market share increased 1.5 share points to 4.4%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by 1 or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen, for the month of September 2022 compared to September 2021, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 47.9% to 51.7%, and in Brazil from 37.7% to 41. 8%. Monster Energy continues to be the leading energy brand in value in both Argentina and Brazil. In Chile, Monster's retail share for the month of September 2022 decreased from 42.2% to 41. 7%. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending October 9, 2020, Monster's reach or market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 13. 5% to 15.5% in Belgium; from 26.6% and to 31% in France; from 28.9% to 29.9% in Great Britain; from 20. 7% to 31.6% in Norway; and from 36.9% to 40.3% in Spain.

According to IRI in Australia, Monster's market share in value for the 4 weeks ending October 16, 2022, increased from 14.2% to 14.8% as compared to the same period the previous year. Monster's market share in value increased from 11.2% to 11.7%. According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the 4 weeks ended October 9, 2022, increased from 12.8% to 12.9% as compare to the same period the previous year. Live+ 's market share in value decreased from 6.4% to 6%, and Mother's market share in value decreased from 6.3% to 5. 9%. According to INTAGE in Japan, in the month ending September 2022, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 53.9% to 55%. According to Nielsen in South Korea, in the month ending September 2022, Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined as compared to the same period the previous year increased from 60.4% to 61.5%. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or 4-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $610.6 million, 37. 6% of total net sales in the 2022 third quarter compared to $527.4 million or 37. 4% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2021. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $71.3 million in the 2021 third quarter. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA, net sales in the 2022 third quarter increased 14.1% in dollars and increased 30.4% in local currencies over the same period in 2021. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the third quarter was 34.7% compared to 37.7% in the same quarter in 2021, and compared to 26.7% in the second quarter of 2022. The company is continuing to address the controllable challenges in its supply chain in EMEA. We're also pleased that in the 2022 third quarter, Monster gained market share in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Norway, Poland, the Republic of Ireland, Spain and Sweden. In Asia Pacific, net sales in the 2022 third quarter decreased 13.9% in dollars and decreased 1.5% in local currencies over the same period in 2021. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 37. 4% versus 43.5% over the same period in 2021, due in part to a product supply issue with an ingredient that impacted a number of our products in Japan, but which has now been resolved, net sales in the 2022 third quarter decreased 35.8% in dollars and decreased 21.2% in local currency. Sales in the 2022 third quarter remain impacted by COVID in certain channels. In South Korea, net sales decreased 8% in dollars but increased 4.4% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2021. Monster remains the market leader in Japan and in South Korea. In China, net sales decreased 6% in dollars and 1.8% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2021, largely impacted by COVID-related lockdowns. We remain optimistic about the prospects for the Monster brand in China. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 30.7% in dollars and 41.5% in local currencies. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the 2022 third quarter increased 63.8% in dollars and increased 74.7% in local currencies over the same period in 2021. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 34.7% for the 2022 third quarter versus 41% in the 2021 third quarter. In Brazil, net sales in the 2022 third quarter increased by 139. 4% in dollars and 142.9% in local currency. Net sales in Mexico increased 17% in dollars and 18% in local currency in the 2022 third quarter. Net sales in Chile decreased 4.4% in dollars and increased 15.1% in local currency in the 2022 third quarter. Net sales in Argentina increased 97.8% in dollars and increased 166.2% in local currency in the 2022 third quarter. We will now provide an update on our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which will be referred to as VPX, the maker of Bang Energy Drinks. We previously discussed the April 2022 final arbitration award, which the arbitrator found in favor of Monster Energy Company, or MEC, and Orange Bang Inc., and against VPX on all claims. The arbitrator awarded MEC and Orange Bang $175 million to remedy VPX' past misconduct as well as attorney's fees and costs, which amounted to nearly $9.3 million. The arbitrator also ordered VPX to pay MEC and Orange Bang an ongoing 5% royalty on all future sales of VPX Bang's energy drinks and other Bang-branded products. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement between MEC and Orange Bang, the award and future royalties will be shared equally between MEC and Orange Bang. On September 29, 2022, the United States District Court for the Central District of California entered final judgment confirming the award. On October 28, 2022, VPX filed a notice of appeal of the District Court's final judgment confirming the award. The company will not recognize the award or royalties until such time as they are realized or realizable.  Additionally, on 29 September 2022, a jury in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, returned a verdict awarding MEC approximately $293 million in damages on its claims against VPX for false advertising, misappropriation of trade secrets and interference with Monster's contracts over shelf space with certain key retailers. MEC will not recognize the jury award until such time as the award is realized or realizable. On October 10, 2022, VPX, along with certain of its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the Southern District of Florida. VPX initiated the bankruptcy action before the District Court could decide certain remaining issues. At this -- as this litigation and other pending proceedings with VPX are subjudicate, we will not be answering any questions on those matters on today's call. Our first alcohol-based product line to leverage Monster's brand equity is scheduled to launch in the first quarter of 2023. The Beast Unleashed will be a full bodied flavored malt beverage with 6% alcohol by volume and will come in 4 bold flavors, mean green, white haze, peach perfect and scary berries, all of which are based on Monster's well-known and popular flavor profiles. CANarchy Kanok will introduce The Beast Unleashed through certain beer distributors in the United States, utilizing a phased approach launch, with the goal of being national by the end of 2023. Our alcohol innovation pipeline is robust. In addition to The Beast Unleashed, we will relaunch Wild Basin Hard Seltzer with new packaging and great new flavors and taste profiles. The Dale's beer family will get a refresh, including the introduction of Dale's American Light Lager, an easy-drinking lager with 4.2% alcohol by volume, 95 calories and 2.5 carbs per 12-ounce serving. We also have several additional innovative alcohol beverage products under development and look forward to sharing use of those products at a later date. In the U.S., in September, we began shipping Monster Reserve Orange Dreamsicle to distributors for an October launch at retail. We are excited about the planned launch of our new Monster Energy Zero Sugar energy drink initially in the United States at retail in January of 2023. Monster Energy's Zero Sugar was specifically developed as an indistinguishable zero sugar analog of our original unique Monster Energy Green flavor. We are excited about the opportunities that this product will provide to our Monster consumers who have come to enjoy the unique taste profile of our original Monster Green flavor, which remains our leading flavor. We are planning to launch Monster Tour Water in the United States, in still and sparkling variants in 19.2 ounce cans in the first half of 2023. Monster Tour Water is a pure unflavored water product. In the first half of 2023, we are also planning to launch Rainstorm in 4 flavors in 12-ounce slim cans to compete directly with certain competitive new entrants in the energy drink category in the United States. In Puerto Rico, during July, we introduced our first 16-ounce 12-pack ultra variety packs. And in August, we launched Monster Reserve Watermelon and Reserve White Pineapple. In Mexico, we expanded our juice portfolio and launched Monster Juice Monarch in August. We launched Monster Dragon Tea Lemon in August in Honduras and El Salvador, and in September in Guatemala. In Australia, during the month of July, we expanded our Mother portfolio and launched Mother Lava Guava. In EMEA, in the third quarter of 2022, we launched Monster Assault and Monster Reserve White Pineapple in a number of countries. In certain countries, we also launched Juiced Monarch, Juiced Chaotic, Ultra Rosa and Ultra Watermelon during the 2022 third quarter. During the 2022 third quarter, we also launched additional SKUs of Burn, Predator and Rain in certain countries. We are excited about the planned launch at retail of our new Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton Zero Sugar Energy Drink initially in select EMEA markets late in the fourth quarter of 2022, followed by an additional 20 markets in the first quarter of 2023. During the third quarter of 2022, we launched Predator in Kazakhstan, Malaysia and Jordan, and we continued the national rollout of Predator in India. We are planning to introduce the Predator brand in additional countries in APAC in the last quarter of 2022 and the first half of 2023. We also launched Monster Super Cola in a can in Japan in August and Monster Rehab Tea Plus Lemonade in October. We estimate October 2022 sales, including CANarchy to be approximately 6. 5% higher than in October 2021 and 5% higher than in October 2021, excluding CANarchy. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, including CANarchy, October 2022 sales would have been approximately 12. 9% higher than the comparable October 2021 sales, and 11.4% higher than October 2021, excluding CANarchy. October 2022 had the same number of selling days as October 2021. The company had sufficient can capacity and co-manufacturing filling capacity across all regions to address demand for October. We would like to remind listeners that we took a general price increase in the United States effective September 1, 2022. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases, promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production.  In some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules. This affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintain inventory levels according to their own internal requirements, which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month, should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue in certain regions, our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed. Turning briefly to share repurchases. During the 2022 third quarter, the company purchased approximately 3.1 million shares of common stock, and as of November 3, 2022, approximately $182.8 million remained available for repurchase under the June 2022 repurchase program. The Board of Directors also authorized a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. One, consumer demand remains solid, even with the pricing actions that have been taken in 2022; two, the company has increased its raw material and finished product inventories to better service its customers and ensure availability of its products; three, our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower landed costs to our EMEA region; four, we are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio; five, we are particularly excited for the launch of Monster Energy Zero Sugar in January 2023 in the United States. As I mentioned previously, Monster Zero Sugar is an analog of our original unique Monster Energy Green flavor. Six, we are planning to launch rate auto body fuel high-performance energy drinks in additional international markets and countries. We are also pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in an additional number of international countries. We are enthusiastic for the planned launch of The Beast Unleashed, our first flavored malt beverage alcohol product and for the opportunities that the CANarchy acquisition presents. We are also enthusiastic for the planned launches of the Monster Tour Water and Rainstorm lines in the first half of 2023 in the United States.  Ten, we believe that we will be able to address many of the challenges we have experienced in our supply chain. Eleven, we consider that certain of the increased costs that we have experienced in the quarter may well be transitory. For example, the LME price for aluminum has reduced materially from its recent March highs, and we are beginning to see a reduction in freight costs as well as reductions in the cost of shipping containers and ocean freight. I would like to now open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan.
Andrea Teixeira : I was hoping if you can comment on the October performance, excluding FX in the low double digits, and not to take demerit of it, but just understanding if there is some signs of retailers that may have decided to take inventory down or seeing some less or the timing of pricing? And was this performance pretty much consistent across all channels?
Hilton Schlosberg : So Alexander (sic) [Andrea] as we look at where we are on the weekly volume trends, we're really not concerned because the trends that we look at are the Nielsen trends and the depletions. So far, volumes seem to be holding up, and we're satisfied with the performance of the price increase. And as you also know, we reduced our promotions as we went through 2022. So at this time, we are continuing to evaluate performance. It looks as if the price increase is, in fact, sticking. I'm looking at numbers. I'm looking at it on my screen now, the total industry and the various participants in the industry, volumes seem to be holding up. So I think that's the only comment that I'd like to make at this time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.
Dara Mohsenian : And Hilton, maybe to follow up on that. Can you just talk about what you're seeing internationally in terms of energy category growth. There have obviously been some broader concerns across CPG around macro impacts and weaker consumer spending. And if you could see that impact the consumer broadly and particularly in the energy category? So an update on what you've seen in terms of the category internationally would be helpful.
Hilton Schlosberg : Yes. So Dara, I think as we look at the category internationally, EMEA really still looks pretty strong. Remember, at the end of the day, we're sending an affordable luxury. So EMEA, and there are lots of concerns in costs in EMEA, gas prices and not necessarily petrol prices, but energy costs are ramping up significantly in EMEA. We've seen lots of other costs hitting us. But at the end of the day, the consumer still seems to be spending, not at the rates they were spending in 2021, but they still seem to be spending on our products anyway. So we've seen growth in EMEA. As I look at other parts of the world, Japan had an issue with an ingredient that Rodney spoke about in his narrative. And the rest of EMEA -- the rest of Asia Pacific, I'm sorry, seems also to be -- to continuing with growth, although not at the same rate as 2021. And we're monitoring the situation. But right now, volumes still seem to be healthy.
Rodney Sacks : The only thing I would add is that we're seeing still a little bit of the effects of COVID in places like China and Japan, wher --
Hilton Schlosberg : In japan, that's correct.
Rodney Sacks : A little bit of the volume there. But again, we think that's more COVID-related and that eventually is going to work its way through and then we think things will start to improve again there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs.
Bonnie Herzog: Give us a sense of how much of your volume growth in the quarter was a result of pre-buying ahead of your price increase? Or did you really limit that? And then on your margins, could you give us a sense of how much of the expense of inventory is left and if it will be fully worked through by the end of this year? And then thinking about next year, and I'm well aware you don't guide, but is there any reason to think your gross margins can get back to the mid-50% range early next year, possibly Q1, especially given the pricing. You've already put in the market. You just mentioned it's sticking, and you did just announced some future pricing in international markets. So how should we think about the gross margin recovery?
Hilton Schlosberg : Okay. So that was quite a long question, Bonnie. Let's start at the very beginning. You spoke about these more expensive imported cans that we have in the system that we brought in to satisfy demand. If you look at cost of sales in the quarter, what we talk about is not a significant number, but will be worked through as we work through normal inventory, and we're anticipating it will be worked through over probably the next, I would say, 3 quarters. So that is something that we will work through in the ordinary course. The cans of many of green and white that we sell in the ordinary course. We sold them every day. And the comment on this quarter was that we had a major promotion with Apex Legends and its city to produce promotional cans overseas because you don't know when they'll arrive, if they'll arrive on time, if they arrive late. So we stick to our core SKUs for our international cans. So -- and you're right, we have had a price increase, and in the U.S., and we've had price increases internationally, we're having more price increases in 2023, as we enunciated on the discussion earlier. So prices are going up and prices going up in response to the inflationary costs that we've seen. As you know, inflation is rampant. But on the other hand, there are some good things that are coming out. We've seen freight rates coming down. There was a lot of capital expenditure put into new equipment and containers. So we've seen freight rates coming down. Fuel is where fuel is. It's very difficult to say what's going to happen with gas prices and diesel and fuel. Aluminum is coming down, but aluminum is one of those elusive commodities in our business because we -- part of our aluminum is hedged, part is bought on n minus 1. So you don't see a perfect improvement in aluminum prices when you look at a specific quarter. So there's -- we're seeing increases in commodities. We're seeing horrific increases in energy costs in Europe. And there's a bunch of costs that are continuing to compromise progress. But all in all, we believe that the price increases that we are putting into place should be able to be tolerated by the consumer and help mitigate some of the increased costs we've seen.
Rodney Sacks : I would perhaps add on that is that, I mean, we all know that the inflation is continuing. I mean, you saw the increase in interest rates today again. So inflation, both in the U.S. and in Europe, is high. And if we continue to see inflation at those rates, I mean, we will review our margins. We'll review pricing, as I'm sure all other consumer product companies have done and will continue to do. And so we will review whether -- going into next year, whether they, in fact, pricing needs is justified in looking at an increase at that time in order to keep our margins reasonable. If we need to do that, we will review it. So just to let you know, we're open to it. But at this stage, we have the current increase, and we'll see how things go. But I think the whole world is going through -- is going to continue for some time to face a lot of inflation. And so whatever we say will be reviewed on a timely basis once we see where we are at, at the beginning of the year.
Hilton Schlosberg : And the other comment -- sorry, I just wanted to respond to another comment that Bonnie made about buying. So we restricted customers, obviously, the distributors in buying in. We didn't give them cut launch. They were allowed to buy a modest amount. And as we look at the numbers for the quarter, we believe that the -- that whatever was purchased was probably sold in the quarter. That's the numbers we've seen.
Operator: And our next question comes from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies.
Kevin Grundy: Just a quick 2-parter, if you'd indulge me. Number one, if you could just confirm that your understanding is still that Red Bull is going to follow the magnitude of the price increase that you took, it's lagging a little bit in the Nielsen data. If you could just confirm that. My broader question is just on the recent distribution changes from some of your competitors with CELSIUS going into the Pepsi system, Bang coming out. Very common for that to create opportunity for incumbents like you guys and Red Bull in this instance. Can you just comment on your observations with respect to the state of those transitions? And how much of that disruption, particularly around Bang, do you think is contributing positively to your market share performance and how sticky that is?
Hilton Schlosberg : Okay. Rodney, do you want to start that one? Or do you want me to?
Rodney Sacks : Yes. I'll sort of start that one. I think that the CELSIUS transition is -- will be interesting. But it's not all a panacea. It doesn't -- there's no magic in it. We think that they will then find increased distribution and increased number of outlets. I think that the discipline that a system like Pepsi will clearly introduce will also be a little bit negative on the flexibility and that they've been able to achieve or being able to enjoy through the beer distribution network. So you get pluses and minuses. And as you can see from the numbers, their strength continues to be in the grocery and large-format store channel. When you look at their numbers and sales per point in the convenience channel, there -- it's not as high. So I don't -- we don't believe that's going to have a major difference. There are a number of other brands that are all sort of getting some traction at a smaller level. I don't know what effect they're going to have. But overall, I think that we're getting a lot of our traction from the innovation and from execution and focus. And I think that will continue.
Hilton Schlosberg : So let me go back to Kevin's question on Red Bull. Kevin, obviously, we can't comment on what they do and what they don't do. But our understanding is they imposed a price increase. And what we're seeing anecdotally is we're not seeing that price increase reflected in many cases at retail, to the extent that the increase was supposed to have have gone up. We, on the other hand, we've seen our prices move up strongly at retail.
Operator: And our next question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel.
Mark Astrachan: I guess just following up on the last question, kind of thinking about shelf placement. So your overall placement has improved. I think you're still a little bit below where you were a couple of years ago, given some of the supply chain challenges. At the same time, you've got lots of innovation, probably more than I think most can remember in at least the last 10 years going into '23. So how do you think about your shelf space on a go-forward basis? Are you putting innovation in place of existing products, are you expanding your footprint on the shelf? And then if you think about the performance in functional category, CELSIUS, C4, GHOST, et cetera, are you seeing placement in the existing energy cooler? Or is that going into new coolers or different places within the existing coolers to a certain extent?
Hilton Schlosberg : So let me start off, Mark. Our sales team has an objective because this is the time where we do shelf plans and shelf negotiations. And our sales team, both on the convenience side and on the large store side, are very active in achieving additional shelf space for our brands because we do feel that they are under spaced, and they do deserve further space relative to what's happening in the market. For example, in convenience, we sell more than single-serve sparkling beverages. So as a category, the energy category really requires more space relative to their fair share. And as such, our brand, which is growing, and we mentioned that we've overtaken Red Bull as a company with all -- the various brands and makeup. The company, our mission is to increase our shelf space at retail. I think we have to.
Rodney Sacks : I think the other point that what's happening now is you've got this emergence of quite a few new brands who are getting distribution through the beer distribution network taking the place of where CELSIUS is and they're getting it. So we've got quite a few brands now putting pressure on the retailers to give additional space. There isn't additional space in the existing energy door. And what we've been trying for a few years is to obviously try and see where our own performance energy and other sort of allied energy brands are able to create a second door, additional shelving separate. And I think that is going to continue. I think that this emergence of a lot of new products in the convenience category, in particular, will result in an expansion of space where -- so hopefully, we believe we will be able to get additional space in the traditional draw for our innovation and our energy product and as well as space for our additional brands and our performance products like Rain and Rainstorm together with a lot of the other performance or clean energy products in additional doors. So we think that will actually happen and will improve this year. But that's always the challenge. You've always got to try and -- you got a certain amount of fixed shelves and you've got to try and increase your space.
Hilton Schlosberg : Yes. But remember, the category is growing here, Mark. And that in and of itself, that's a factor for the retailer. The space that they allocate to energy generates them really good returns, really good revenue. And it's something -- space is something that we always strive for, including putting our own coolers in retailers. So that's a big push for us, and always has been.
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Galbo from Bank of America.
Peter Galbo: I'll be pretty quick. Just to clarify, Hilton, your fourth quarter gross margins, you're going to be lapping, I guess, the promo benefit from 3Q, but should we still expect a sequential improvement in the gross margin? Or is that promo benefit you saw in the third quarter enough that you'd be actually down quarter-on-quarter into 4Q?
Hilton Schlosberg : The difficulty, Peter, is that we don't give guidance. So it's hard to give guidance because we don't give it. But let me just leave you with a thought when you talk about gross margins that the price increase was effective September 1. So we basically had 1 month of a price increase. We will have 3 months of a price increase in December. While we may have additional costs, we will still have that benefit of the price increase for the fourth quarter.
Operator: And at this time, we will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference call back over to Mr. Sacks for any closing remarks.
Rodney Sacks : Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continue to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company, both at home and abroad, and in particular, expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally. We believe that we are well positioned in the beverage industry and continue to be optimistic about the future of our company. We hope that you remain safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. We do thank you for joining today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-08-04 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day to everyone. My name is Devin, and I will be your op -- your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background. After the speakersâ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Mr. Rodney Sacks, you may begin your conference.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I am Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, is on the call, as is Tom Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom Kelly will now read our cautionary statement.
Tom Kelly: Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends, as well as the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the companyâs business and operations. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations, and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2022, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion on the specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you, Tom. The company achieved record second quarter net sales of $1.66 billion in the 2022 second quarter, 13.2% higher than net sales of $1.46 billion in the 2021 comparable period and 16.9% higher on foreign currency adjusted basis. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent increased demand for the companyâs energy drinks, the company prioritized ensuring product availability for its customers and consumers. This strategic direction has remained in place throughout the global supply chain challenges and disruptions despite adversely impacting the companyâs profitability. The company continues to stand by its strategy to ensure product availability and solidify the continued long-term growth of the companyâs brands. During the 2022 second quarter, the company experienced a significant increase in cost of sales relative to the comparative 2021 second quarter, primarily due to increased freight rates and fuel costs, including costs relating to the importation of aluminum cans, increased ingredient and other input costs, including secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees, increased aluminum can costs attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing, geographical and product sales mix and production inefficiencies. The company estimates that of the increase in cost of sales in the 2022 second quarter of $250.3 million, approximately $164.4 million was comprised of; one, approximately $66.7 million due to increased freight rates and fuel costs, including costs relating to the importation of aluminum cans; two, approximately $45.9 million due to increased ingredient and other import costs, including secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees; three, approximately $27.5 million due to increased aluminum can costs attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing; four, approximately $15.1 million due to geographical and product sales mix; and five, approximately $9.2 million due to production inefficiencies. The company continued to experience additional global supply chain challenges, including the lack of adequate shipping containers and port congestion, which resulted in shortages of certain ingredients and finished products. As a result, the company continued to air freight substantial quantities of certain ingredients internationally, particularly to EMEA, Asia-Pacific and Latin America at additional costs and inefficiencies. Furthermore, the company experienced significant increases in distribution expenses, including increased fuel, freight and warehousing costs, which adversely impacted operating expenses. The company continued to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 second quarter was 47.1%, compared to 57.2% in the 2021 second quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 second quarter was partially offset by pricing actions. Operating expenses for the 2022 second quarter were $406. 9 million, compared with $310.9 million in the 2021 second quarter. The comparative operating expenses for the 2021 second quarter included a $16.9 million reversal of amounts previously accrued in connection with an intellectual property claim. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2022 second quarter were 24.6%, compared with 21.3% in the 2021 second quarter and 25.6% in the 2019 second quarter pre-COVID. Distribution expenses for the 2022 second quarter increased to $87.9 million, which is an increase of 36% or 5.3% of net sales, compared to $64.6 million or 4.4% of net sales in the 2021 second quarter and 3.4% of net sales in the 2019 second quarter pre-COVID. The $23.3 million increase in distribution expenses was primarily due to increased freight out expenses of $13.5 million as a result of higher outbound freight rates and fuel, increased volume and out-of-orbit freight, as well as higher warehouse expenses of $9.7 million as a result of higher raw material and finished product inventories in the United States and EMEA. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to increased payroll expenses, increased expenditures for sponsorships and endorsements, and increased expenditures for travel and entertainment. Certain of these increases were the result of the companyâs return to activities consistent with pre-COVID-19 levels. We have decreased our reliance on imported cans and are currently purchasing aluminum cans from local sources in both the U.S. and EMEA. We anticipate seeing a reduction in cost of sales through increased use of domestic cans as we cycle through existing inventories of imported cans over the next few quarters. We rebuilt and increased finished product inventory levels across the United States and EMEA to reduce the excessive cost of long distance freight to satisfy demand and to return to our orbit strategy of producing in closer proximity to our customers. The cost of repositioning finished products to distribution centers are included in freight-in costs. Operating income for the 2022 second quarter decreased 29.1% to $373.0 million from $526 million in the 2021 comparative quarter. Net income decreased 32.3% to $273.4 million, as compared to $403.8 million in the 2021 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2022 second quarter decreased 32.2% to $0.51 from $0.75 in the second quarter of 2021. Through pricing actions, the company was able to achieve positive pricing appreciation in the United States and in EMEA. Due to continued cost pressures, the company is implementing a net sales price increase in the range of 6% market wide in the United States effective September 1, 2022. The company will also be implementing price increases in the second half of 2022 in certain international markets, some in addition to price increases or pricing actions taken earlier this year in order to mitigate inflationary cost pressures.

Monster sales increased 26.9%. Monsterâs market share in value increased 1.3 points to 28.4% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Predator increased 53.1% and its market share increased 0.8 of a share point to 4%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen for the month of June 2022, compared to June 2021, Monsterâs retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 46.9% to 49.2%. Monster Energy continues to be the leading brand in value in Argentina. According to Nielsen for the month of June 2022 compared to June 2021, Monsterâs retail market share in value increased in Brazil from 35.7% to 39.9%. Monster is now the leading energy brand in value in Brazil, marking another important milestone for our brand in South America. In Chile, Monsterâs retail share for the month of June 2022 decreased from 41.9% to 38.1% due to a shortage of shipping containers. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country-to-country. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ending July 17, 2022, Monsterâs retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 25.8% to 31.6% in France from 27.8% to 32.1% in Norway and from 37.6% to 39.7% in Spain.

We again point out that certain market statistics that single months or four-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $649 million, 39.2% of total net sales in the 2022 second quarter, compared to $546.3 million or 37.4% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2021. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $53.4 million in the 2022 second quarter. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the companyâs military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA, net sales in the 2022 second quarter increased 13.8% in dollars and increased 26.8% in local currencies over the same period in 2021. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the second quarter was 26.7%, compared to 39.8% in the same quarter in 2021. Gross profit in the second quarter was impacted by increased freight for imported cans, increased raw material and ingredient costs and increased co-packing fees, higher aluminum commodity pricing and air freight costs. In local currencies, gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 27.1%. The company is continuing to address the controllable challenges in its supply chain in EMEA. We are also pleased that in the 2022 second quarter, Monster gained market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Norway, Poland, Spain and Sweden. In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the 2022 second quarter decreased 1.1% in dollars and increased 8.2% in local currencies over the same period in 2021. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 40.4% versus 44.4% over the same period in 2021. In Japan, net sales in the 2022 second quarter decreased 9.6% in dollars and increased 3.3% in local currency. Sales performance for the comparable period in 2021 was largely impacted due to COVID-19 restrictions in Japan. In South Korea, net sales decreased 5.2% in dollars and increased 3.8% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2021. Monster remains the market leader in Japan and South Korea. In China, net sales decreased 2.1% in dollars and 8% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2021, largely impacted by COVID-related lockdowns. We remain optimistic about the prospects for the Monster brand in China. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, and Guam, net sales increased 1.3% in dollars and 7.6% in local currencies. Sales in Australia and New Zealand were negatively impacted by shipping delays of certain flavors, concentrates and ingredients. Furthermore, sales in Australia were also impacted by severe flooding in that country in the 2022 second quarter. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the 2022 second quarter increased 66.7% in dollars and increased 69.7% in local currencies over the same period in 2021.

Net sales in Argentina increased 200.1% in dollars and 26 9.4% in local currency in the 2022 second quarter. I will now provide the most recent update on our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which I will refer to as VPX, the maker of Bang energy drinks. In June 2020, Monster Energy Company, which I will refer to as MEC and Orange Bang, Inc., a family-owned beverage business and the rightful owner of several trademark registrations to the Bang marks initiated an arbitration against VPX. MEC and Orange Bang alleged that VPX breached a 2010 settlement agreement with Orange Bang that restricted VPXâs use of the Bang trademark to products that are creatine-based or marketed and sold only in nutritional channels, as well as claims that VPX infringed Orange Bangâs trademark rights to the Bang marks. In April 2022, the arbitrator issued a final award finding in favor of MEC and Orange Bang on all claims. The arbitrator awarded MEC and Orange Bang $175 million to remedy VPXâs past misconduct, as well as attorneysâ fees and costs, which amounted to nearly $9.3 million. The arbitrator also ordered VPX to pay MEC and Orange Bang an ongoing 5% royalty on all future sales of VPX Bangâs energy drinks and other Bang branded products. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement between MEC and Orange Bang, the award and future royalties will be shared equally between MEC and Orange Bang. On July 1, 2022, the United States District Court for the Central District of California granted MEC and Orange Bangâs motion to confirm the arbitratorâs award and denied VPXâs motion to vacate the arbitratorâs award. MEC and Orange Bang have requested that the court end to final judgment. On July 28, 2022, VPX filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the non-circuit. The company will not recognize the award or royalties until such time as they are realized or realizable. Yesterday, the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit issued a ruling affirming the decision of the United States District Court in the Southern District of Florida, in which the District Court rejected VPXâs claim that MECâs line of Reign energy drinks infringed the trade rest of its line of Bang energy drinks. MECâs lawsuit against VPX for force advertising, unfair competition and misappropriation of trade secrets in the Central District of California is still pending with trial scheduled to begin later this month. As this litigation and other pending proceedings with VPX are subdued, I will not be answering any questions on those matters on todayâs call. The first alcohol-based product line that we plan to launch since the acquisition of CANarchy will be a full bodied flavored malt beverage that will be launched late in the 2022 fourth quarter under the brand name the Beast Unleashed. Beast Unleashed will leverage Monsterâs brand equity, while carving out its own unique space in the beverage alcohol sector and will be distinguishable from the many hard seltzer brands that have become so ubiquitous over the last several years. The Beast Unleashed will have a 6% alcohol content by volume and will come in four great tasting bold flavors, which are based on certain of Monsterâs well-known and popular flavor profiles. Beast Unleashed will be launched through beer distributors in the United States, utilizing a phased state launch approach, with the goal of being national by the end of 2023 and will initially be offered in 16-ounce single-serve cans, as well as a 12-can variety pack in 12-ounce sleek cans. Our alcohol innovation pipeline is robust, with a number of additional innovative product lines currently under development. We look forward to sharing use of such additional alcohol beverage products at a later date. We are excited about the planned launch of our new Monster Energy Zero Sugar energy drink in the 2022 fourth quarter initially in the United States. Monster Energy Zero Sugar was specifically developed as an indistinguishable Zero Sugar analog of our original unique Monster Energy Green flavor. We are excited about the opportunity that this product will provide to our Monster consumers who have come to enjoy the unique taste profile of our original Monster Green flavor, which remains our leading flavor. In April of 2022, we launched Pure North Energy Seltzers in sleek 355 ml cans in three flavors Cucumber Lime, Black Cherry and Grape fruit Lemonade in Canada. At the end of June 2022, we expanded our core Monster Energy portfolio in Canada by launching Monster Reserve in two flavors, Watermelon and White Pineapple, both in 473 ml cans. In Latin America, we introduced several new energy drinks in our Monster Energy Predator and Fury product lines in certain Latin American countries in the 2022 second quarter. In April 2022 in New Zealand, we launched LIVE+ Watermelon, our fourth LIVE+ flavor. In EMEA, in the second quarter of 2022, we launched Monster Nitro and Monster Assault in a number of countries. In certain countries, we also launched Juiced Monarch and Chaotic during the 2022 second quarter. During the 2022 second quarter, we also launched additional SKUs of Burn, Relentless, Nalu and Reign in certain countries. During the second quarter of 2022, we launched Predator in Turkey and we continued the national rollout of Predator in India and Vietnam in June, expanding the brand to East India and North Vietnam. We also launched Predator in Cambodia in July 2022. We are planning to introduce the Predator brand in several additional countries in APAC in the second half of 2022. In Japan, we launched Monster Super Fuel Killer Kiwi and Monster Energy Ultra Sunrise in China. We estimate July 2022 sales, including to be CANarchy to be approximately 12.9% higher than in July 2021 and 11.2% higher than in July 2021 excluding CANarchy. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, excluding CANarchy, July 2022 sales would have been approximately 16.6% higher than the comparable July 2021 sales. July 2022 has had one less selling day compared to July 2021. The company had sufficient can capacity and co-manufacturing facility -- capacity across all regions to address demand for July. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases, and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers, as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue, in certain regions our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. One, the company is increasing its raw material and finished product inventories to better service its customers and ensure availability of its products. Two, our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower landed costs to our EMEA region. Three, we are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio. Four, we are planning to continue additional launches of our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in additional international countries. Five, we are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in an additional number of international countries. Six, we are enthusiastic for the planned launch of the Beast Unleased, our first flavored malt beverage alcohol product and for the opportunity that the CANarchy acquisition presents. Seven, we believe that we will be able to address many of the challenges we have experienced in our supply chain. Eight, we consider that certain of the increased costs we have experienced in the quarter may well be transitory. For example, the current cost of aluminum has reduced materially from its recent March highs and we are beginning to see a reduction in fuel and freight costs, as well as reductions in the cost of shipping containers and ocean freight. I would like to now open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
Operator:  Our first question will come from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.
Bonnie Herzog: Hi. Thanks. Hi.
Operator: Your line is now open.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. Thank you. I guess a question on gross margins. I simply donât understand really why they were the bad in the quarter. I guess I was under the impression that you were already buying a fair amount of your aluminum cans from U.S., and therefore, should have been less reliant on the importation of cans, I guess, at least in the U.S. So, I thought that was the plan. However, I do see your inventory levels in the quarter went even higher and are almost three times the level they were last year. So, I guess, help us understand that and just trying to think through, is this really the right way to manage the business? And then, Hilton, you mentioned these pressures are transitory or it was in the release, but I guess, they are not really feeling like it. So when do you guys expect to be 100% buying in the U.S. and EMEA for your supply, and really no longer importing aluminum cans?
Hilton Schlosberg: Sure. Bonnie, thank you for that question. I think a lot of people probably may want to ask the same question. So thanks for addressing it early on. We have always taken a stance that objective is to support our customers and our consumers. We went through entire times in 2020 and 2021 when we did not have enough capacity to service our customers and our consumers. We had bottler screaming. We had retailer screaming, and at the time, we made a very conscious effort that we were going to import cans at expensive costs, not in terms of the actual cost of the can, but the cost of importing a cans, the container costs, the marriage, the which you guys call the merge, just everything relating to the importation of aluminum cans. So that was an absolute conscious decision. As cans started arriving late in 2021, EMEA was the most affected. I think we have had a number of discussions about how EMEA was affected and a substantial number of those cans went into EMEA and have been consumed over a period of time. Itâs difficult with our business because we have promotions from time-to-time. For example, we have got the Apex Legends promotions now and the cans that come in are not promotional cans. So, they are using production when thereâs market and market demand. So, in EMEA, we stopped importing cans. We thought we would still have to import cans during 2022. We stopped that and thereâs no longer importation of cans into EMEA in 2022. In 2021, we have had  coming in the U.S. and we will soon be out of those cans as soon as we get over this Apex Legends promotion. But in the U.S., the percentage of imported cans in our furnish is very low compared to what it was in the second quarter in EMEA. So, I hope that answers your question. We did it as a conscious effort to support and to supply our customers because we are in this business for the long-term. We are not in this business for the second quarter of 2022. We are in this business for the long-term and itâs important to us to ensure that our customers and our consumers continue to have energy products.
Operator: Your next question.
Hilton Schlosberg: So is there anything else that I didnât answer that or I should have answered, Bonnie?
Bonnie Herzog: But, I guess, for me, itâs still back the question as you are making this conscious decision to keep have a bigger supply of cans and have elevated inventory. How do we think about that as I assume you are going to work down that inventory now? Is that starting to happen or will happen in Q3 and Q4, and I assume itâs very elevated cost. So do we think about these pressures on your gross margin, quite frankly, very much continuing Q3 and Q4, is that right about the product?
Hilton Schlosberg: No. As I -- yeah. Okay. Great question. As we look at the future, I mean, that in cost of sales, fuel is coming down, we know that. We know that freight is coming down. We are in that every day of our lives. We know that ocean freight is coming down. We know that we have been able now to really diminish the amount of materials that we having to airfreight to keep the wheels moving with product thatâs coming out of the U.S. with concentrates. We know that AFF is producing and up and running in Ireland. We know that the percentage of aluminum cans is coming down. We know that aluminum costs are coming down. Aluminum reached a peak -- see if I can find it just very quickly. The maximum level of aluminum, including the Midwest premium was 1.8073 in March -- on March 7th. We buy where we are not hedged -- the portion thatâs not hedged is bought at M minus 1. So, the March cans, so the April cans would be based on March pricing. So and we know that aluminum today including, let me find that, including the Midwest premium is 1.36. So, itâs come down from a peak of 1.81 to 1.36. So we know thatâs a fact, right? We also know that we built up inventories, which we had to because thereâs inventories we were talking about in 2021 were just not sustainable. They were just not sustainable. So we built up inventories and we are now able to avoid a lot of the shipping, the freight thatâs been out of orbit. So you add all of that together and we donât give forecast. I donât want to start giving forecast. But itâs very clear that 2022, the second quarter, as in fact, we had anticipated would probably be our worst quarter in terms of margin. But I just want to stress again that we are in business for the long-term and we are supporting our customers and our business in the long-term.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.
Andrea Teixeira: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. On the same topic and I tried to do the phasing of the cost pressures and the pricing, would you say pricing both domestic, international would be by that mid single-digit and could probably cover about a third of this $250 million that you quoted? And then you have, of course, and I appreciate the breakdown that you gave, you can phase out some of this higher cost for aluminum, also the $67 million that you said to bring cans imported. So would you end up to about from the $250 million to about $100 million to $150 million in pressures into the fourth quarter, I want to check that? And then on the Monster Zero Sugar, congrats on that, should we think like we obviously have seen Coke Zero Sugar recruit new customer -- new consumers into the category, are you thinking how incremental that could be against Ultra? I am assuming, as Rodney said, it attracts the need state for the typical Monster consumer, because of the taste profile, and also because of the packaging and some more masculine and more into the core consumer, is that fair? Do you have the shelves coming in, how much support you believe you can give to the launch? Thank you.
Hilton Schlosberg: Okay. So those were two questions all in. I will start with the first one. So we donât give guidance and what I have tried to do on this call is give some direction. Thatâs what we are saying -- thatâs what we are seeing is coming down. Itâs not going to happen overnight, because there are costs in the system that will take their time to work through. So, in principle as, since we donât give guidance, I have given some general direction, which I hope you will find helpful and the other analysts will find helpful in analyzing where we go from here. But I just want to repeat yet again that we are in this business for the long-term. We are in this business to support our customers. And yes, maybe we did take a hiccup in gross margin in 2022 -- the second quarter of 2022, but there have been a lot of other cost pressures, including imported cans, imported cans being one of them, but at least we were able to bring our inventories back to a situation where we are able to service customers and we are able to service consumers. Look, it will be a terrible situation, when our price goes up in September 1 and we donât have sufficient inventories to satisfy demand. I mean, that would just be the end. So we have done our very best to stay on track and to work within a very, very difficult supply chain environment.
Rodney Sacks: Perhaps. Thanks. Hilton, I could address the second part on the actual Zero Sugar. I think that we have hedge Zero sugar products. We have the full Ultra line. We have low carb and absolutely zero. But none of them have been really an analog of our original Monster Green. The original Monster Green flavor, which we have had now for over 20 years is still our leading product pretty much in every the world. Consumers do want a choice, and as consumers, I think, get a little older, they do start looking to -- for a sugar -- zero sugar or sugar-free alternative, but we would obviously like to stay in the same franchise with the same product, with the same personality. Itâs in a black can with a sort of green claw. And so we feel there is a way to, A, increase the franchise to bring additional consumers who really want that original Monster flavor, but in a Zero Sugar and also to retain and broaden our existing consumer base, as we bring younger consumers in, they tend to not be as worried or concerned about the sugar content. As you get a little older, I think, sugar content does become an issue. There are also in many countries around the world, they have started to tax products with sugar, have label requirements. So we think that by having an offering our original green Monster in a sugar-free -- a zero-sugar version with a very similar can, itâs distinguishable, but very similar with, as I said, it still has the same personality and image. We believe we will further entrench our consumer base and expand it for many years to come. So, we think this is a very important development and an important way we can continue to solidify and make Monster and keep it unique because the Monster flavor is its own unique flavor that is so popular and we would like to continue to expand on it and build on it. So, the plans are to obviously roll this out after the U.S. very extensively.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Mark Astrachan.
Mark Astrachan: Yes. Hey. Good afternoon, guys. I guess I am going to ask one question in two parts, but I swear itâs related. So, the first one, Hilton, I mean, obviously, I get everybody gets what you are saying about guidance, what you think about cost pressures. I just think it would be immensely helpful based on just the commentary that I have been getting from folks or feedback from your shareholders. If you could at least just directionally confirm the gross margins should get better from here and if you could give a sort of magnitude around it, I think it would be helpful. But the related and more serious question is, you have a lot of volatility historically in gross margin, and I have asked this question before, but I am curious, given the current environment, how you think about whether you want to do more with the Coke system from a procurement standpoint, potentially manufacturing through their co-packers in the U.S. or their bottlers in the U.S.? And has there been any sort of change in how you might be thinking about that, given, obviously, whatâs happened over the last, call it, 12 months where you would have less to worry about, I suppose, if you are working with them more closely?
Hilton Schlosberg: Yeah. So, with regard to your first point, I think I have already answered that. I believe that the second quarter is probably -- we are probably going to see the lowest margin in the year. And as regards better direction than that, Mark, we just donât do it. We just donât give guidance. So, thatâs the first point. And then on the second point is, we are really not sure and we have had discussions with our distribution partner on a number of issues. And we are not sure that further engagement with them on any of these topics would be positive, but -- positive in terms of lowering cost of sales. But we are continuing to have those discussions and if it makes sense, then definitely we will -- we definitely will. I donât want to disclose too much, but one of our partners in Europe, that is actually part of the Coca-Cola system, did not fare better in procuring cans than we were able to. So I just want to just put all of this in perspective that itâs not necessarily a panacea.
Operator: Your next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS.
Peter Grom: Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Hope you are doing well. I guess I will ask about topline I guess. So, Rodney, Hilton, I guess, I just wanted to ask about Bang, like what are you seeing there in terms of shelf space and kind of what do you expect as they kind of transition to distributors? And I guess, do you see a potential opportunity for you to capture some of that incremental shelf space?
Hilton Schlosberg: I think generally in transitionsâ¦
Rodney Sacks: Yeah.
Hilton Schlosberg: â¦ thereâs always upheavals, okay. ITâS transitions never happen cleanly overnight. Thereâs always upheavals. And remember, that Bang is in a lot of the Pepsi shelf space and a lot of the Pepsi Cos and despite that you guys have seen their shares decrease over the last 24 months or so. So I donât want to say any more than that. I am not sure if Rodney wants to say anymore, but I would say that, obviously, we continue to grow up as much shelf space as we can. We contract for a lot of our own shelf space and we work with the Coke bottlers and then, on the other hand, we work in with the Pepsi space and with the Pepsi coolers.
Rodney Sacks: Yeah. Just to bullet lightly. I mean, the -- if Bang transitions out of the Pepsi coolers, you have obviously all aware of the announcement that Celsius whoâs been trying to secure and has been securing additional shelf space, we will go into the Pepsi system. So there will be a lot of fighting going on. Thereâs the Ghost brand lining you to a lesser degree and C4. So you have got all of these sort of performance brands basically fighting for some more shelf space, and obviously, we will do the same. So there will be a lot of transition going on and we believe that we are obviously focused on that as well and our own brands and increasing our own shelf space.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Hi guys. One of the things we have been watching careâ¦
Hilton Schlosberg: Hi, Kaumil.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Hey. Hi, Hilton. We have been watching carefully about the impact on inflation on the consumer with gas prices and stuff. It doesnât seem like we have seen a slowdown at all. I am curious which you are observing and maybe if you have done any test in markets like maybe Midland, Texas or Phoenix, or some of those markets where inflation is much higher than it has been nationally if you are perhaps seeing different trends?
Hilton Schlosberg: So what Iâd like to comment on is, one, retailer and I am not going to mention who they are in terms of their own schematics and their own structures, went early on the price increase. They rolled out early and not only with us but with the competition as well and they have seen no reduction in sales based on that action. So what we are seeing anecdotally is a continuation of the growth in the category. Yes, it has slowed somewhat, but look in Europe, where the categories are a lot older. The growth has been escalating there faster than in the U.S. So we have seen that and now we are seeing the other concern may be abating everyone is asking questions about gas prices and well gas prices affect the consumption of energy drinks, and frankly, we said at the time that when we have seen high gas prices a portion that hadnât affected the sale of energy drinks and we are seeing gas prices now coming down slowly, but truly they are coming down. So I think that maybe answers your question as well.
Operator: And our final question for todayâs Q&A will come from Charlie Higgs with Redburn.
Charlie Higgs: Hi, Hilton, Rodney. Thanks for the question.
Hilton Schlosberg: Hi, Charlie. Totally fine.
Charlie Higgs: Hi. I was wondering if you could talk a bit about the price increases you put through in your international markets and what the response is there. And maybe if you could just touch on the scope of the price increases you are planning for in H2 2022, maybe just some information on what countries and what products would be very useful please?
Hilton Schlosberg: Yeah. Thereâs a range of countries that we took prices in the first half of 2022, either directly in price increases or through a reduction in promotions. And we see an uplift effecting the quarter already of the impact of those price increases. As regards the second six months, thereâs really a list of countries and I donât think we have got the time to go through them now, but thereâs a list of countries where we will be taking further price increases where we can. For example, in France, you cannot, if you have gone -- if you have had one price increase in a year, you cannot go with the second price increase. So, thereâs a range of different countries where we will be taking price increases. Brazil, we took price increases earlier this year. Chile, we took a price increase earlier this year. So we have been doing this on a consistent basis, not to profiteer from inflation, but really to mitigate the whole cost in the system has -- you guys will appreciate.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I would like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad, and in particular, expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally. We believe that we are well-positioned in the beverage industry and continue to be optimistic about the future of our company. We hope that you will stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: This concludes Monster Beverage second quarter 2022 conference call. Thank you for attending todayâs presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-05-05 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Company First Quarter 2022 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.
 I would now like to turn the conference over to Rodney Sacks and Hilton Schlosberg. Please go ahead. 
Rodney Sacks: Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, is on the call; as is Tom Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom Kelly will now read our cautionary statement.

The company assumes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
 I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks. 
Rodney Sacks: Thank you. The company achieved record first quarter net sales of $1.52 billion in the 2022 first quarter, 22.1% higher than net sales of $1.24 billion in the 2021 comparable period. As in recent quarters, to meet increased demand for our products, rather than experience out of stocks for certain lines at retail, the company incurred operational inefficiencies in the United States and in various countries, resulting in increased costs.
 During the 2022 first quarter, the company continued to procure additional quantities of aluminum cans from suppliers in the United States and abroad in response to increased consumer demand. In the first quarter of 2022, the company experienced significant increases in cost of sales relative to the comparative 2021 first quarter, primarily due to increased freight rates and fuel costs, including costs relating to the importation of aluminum cans, as well as aluminum can costs attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing.
 The company also experienced a significant increase in ingredient and other input costs, secondary packaging materials, co-packing fees and production inefficiencies. The company continued to experience additional global supply chain challenges, including the lack of adequate shipping containers and port congestion, which resulted in shortages of certain ingredients and finished products.
 This necessitated the company air freighting substantial quantities of certain ingredients internationally, particularly to EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America at additional costs and inefficiencies. Furthermore, the company experienced significant increases in distribution expenses, including increased fuel, freight and warehousing costs, which adversely impacted operating expenses. The company continued to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment.
 In the United States, the company secured additional co-packing capacity to meet increased demand for certain of its products. The company estimates that approximately $46 million of costs in the quarter were the result of operating inefficiencies due in part to strong consumer demand, including the importation of aluminum cans, as well as COVID-19-related issues such as port congestion, shortage of shipping containers resulting in the need to airfreight ingredients, which the company continues to address.
 In addition, increased commodity and raw materials costs, including aluminum, other ingredient costs and secondary packaging incurred during the quarter, amounted to approximately $45 million, and increases in freight rates and fuel impacted gross profits by approximately $6 million.
 Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, for the 2022 first quarter was 51.1% compared with 57.5% in the 2021 frist quarter. The decrease in gross profit percentage for the 2022 first quarter was primarily the result of the items mentioned previously as well as geographical sales mix.
 Additionally, [ Drop ] requires a first value step-up of the CANarchy inventories of $3.8 million, which together with expenses related to the acquisition of CANarchy of $4.2 million during the quarter, adversely affected both gross margins and operating expenses.
 The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 first quarter was partially offset by pricing actions. Operating expenses for the 2022 first quarter was $377.2 million, compared with $300.8 million in the 2021 first quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2022 first quarter were 24.8% compared with 24.2% in the 2021 first quarter. Distribution expenses for the 2022 first quarter increased to $81.4 million, which is an increase of 49.7% or 5.4% of net sales compared to $54.4 million or 4.4% of net sales in the 2021 first quarter.
 The $27 million increase in distribution expenses was primarily due to increased freight out costs of $20.6 million as a result of higher outbound freight rates and fuel, increased volume and out-of-orbit freight, as well as higher warehouse expenses of $6.4 million as a result of higher raw material and finished good product inventories in the United States and EMEA. We believe that a portion of the increase in distribution expenses that we experienced in the quarter are likely to be transitory.
 The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to increased expenditures for travel and entertainment, increased payroll expenses, increased professional services expenses, including accounting and legal expenses, increased commissions and increased sponsorships and endorsements. During the comparative 2021 first quarter, the company decreased expenditures for travel and entertainment as well as our marketing programs largely as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was less pronounced on such expenses during the 2022 first quarter.
 Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 first quarter were 24.8% as compared to operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the 2019 first quarter pre-COVID, which was 27.7%.
 Our 2 new suppliers of aluminum cans in the United States are now operational. And as a result, we are able to decrease our reliance on the use of imported aluminum cans in the United States. In the United States, we anticipate seeing a reduction in cost of sales related to the use of imported aluminum cans in the latter half of 2022. Although, we expect to reduce the importation of aluminum cans into EMEA in the second half of 2022, we will only see a reduction in cost of sales after we have worked through current inventories of imported cans in EMEA.
 We rebuilt and increased finished product inventory levels across the United States and EMEA to reduce excessive cost of long-distance freight to satisfy demand and to return to our orbit strategy of producing in closer proximity to our customers. The cost of repositioning finished products to distribution centers are included in freight-in cost.
 Operational income -- sorry, operating income for the 2022 first quarter decreased 3.5% to $399.5 million from $414.1 million in the 2021 comparative quarter, primarily due to the company's operations in EMEA and Asia Pacific.
 Net income decreased 6.7% to $294.2 million as compared to $315.2 million in the 2021 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2022 first quarter decreased 6.8% to $0.55 from $0.59 in the first quarter of 2021.
 Through pricing actions during the quarter, the company was able to record positive pricing actions in excess of 3% in the United States and in EMEA. Due to continued cost pressures, the company is planning for a net sales price increase in the range of 6% market-wide in the United States effective September 1, 2022. The company is also monitoring the opportunity for additional pricing actions internationally as well as in United States.

Monster's market share in value increased 0.8 of a share point to 28.3% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Predator increased 67% and its market share increased 0.9 of a share point to 3.7%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
 According to Nielsen, for the month of March 2022 compared to March 2021, Monster's retail market share in value decreased in Argentina from 45.2% to 45%. Monster's Energy continues to be the leading energy brand in value in Argentina.
 According to Nielsen, for the month of March -- month of March 2022 compared to March 2021, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Brazil from 34.9% to 40.2%. Monster is now the leading energy brand in value in Brazil, marking another important milestone for our brand in South America.
 In Chile, Monster's retail share for the month of March 2022, decreased from 40% to 36.3%, due to a shortage of shipping containers. Our bottler in Chile is in the process of validating its new production line in order to increase our in-country production.
 I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country, and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country.
 According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending April 2, 2022, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period of the previous year, grew from 14.7% to 16.2% in Germany.

 We again point out that in certain market statistics that cover single months, or 4-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods.
 Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $553.4 million, 36.4% of total net sales in the 2022 first quarter compared to $459.4 million or 36.9% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2021. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $32.9 million in the 2022 first quarter.
 Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.
 In EMEA, net sales in the 2022 first quarter increased 21.8% in dollars and increased 30% in local currencies over the same period in 2021. Gross profit in this region, as a percentage of net sales, for the first quarter was 29.6% compared to 37.3% in the same quarter in 2021. Gross profit in the first quarter was impacted by higher aluminum commodity pricing, increased freight for imported cans, increased raw material and ingredient costs, as well as airfreight costs.
 In -- the company is continuing to address the controllable challenges in its supply chain in EMEA. We're also pleased that in the 2022 first quarter, Monster gained market share in the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, Norway, Poland, Spain and Sweden.
 In Asia Pacific, net sales in the 2022 first quarter increased 1.9% in dollars and increased 9.4% in local currencies over the same period in 2021. Gross profit in this region, as a percentage of net sales, was 40.9% versus 48.8% over the same period in 2021.
 In Japan, net sales in the 2022 first quarter decreased 5.8% in dollars, but increased 3.4% in local currency. Sales decreased over the same period in 2021, largely due to COVID-19 restrictions in Japan.
 In South Korea, net sales increased 71.7% in dollars and 86.1% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2021. Monster remains the market leader in Japan and South Korea.
 In China, net sales decreased 8.9% in dollars and 10.8% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2021, largely impacted by COVID-related lockdowns. We remain optimistic about the prospects for the Monster brand in China.
 In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales decreased 13.8% in dollars and 7.9% in local currencies. Sales in Australia and New Zealand were negatively impacted by shipping delays of certain flavors, concentrates and ingredients. Furthermore, sales in Australia were also impacted by severe flooding in that country in the 2022 first quarter.
 In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the 2022 first quarter increased 52.5% in dollars and increased 59.7% in local currencies over the same period in 2021.

Net sales in Argentina increased 103.1% in dollars and 146.4% in local currency in the 2022 first quarter.
 I will now discuss our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which I will refer to as VPX, the maker of Bang Energy Drinks. In June 2020, Monster Energy Company, which I will refer to as MEC and Orange Bang, Inc., a family-owned beverage business and the rightful owner of several trademark registrations to the Bang marks, initiated an arbitration against VPX.
 MEC and Orange Bang allege that VPX reached a 2010 settlement agreement with Orange Bang that restricted VPX's use of the Bang trademark to products that are creatine-based or marketed and sold only in nutritional channels as well as claims at VPX infringed Orange Bang's trademark rights to the Bang marks.
 In April 2022, the arbitrator issued a final award finding in favor of MEC and Orange Bang on all claims. The arbitrator found that VPX's Bang Energy Drinks, which VPX advertisers containing super creatine and other Bang branded products do not contain creatine, and do not provide the benefits of creatine. Because Bang branded products are thus not creatine-based, and are not limited to nutritional channels, the arbitrator found they are being sold in breach of the settlement agreement. The arbitrator also found that VPX's Bang branded product infringe Orange Bang's trademarks.
 The arbitrated rewarded MEC and Orange Bang $175 million to remedy VPX's past misconduct and attorney's fees and costs, which amounted to nearly $9.3 million. The arbitrator also ordered VPX to pay MEC and Orange Bang an ongoing 5% royalty on all future net sales of Bang products. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement between MEC and Orange Bang, the award and future royalties will be shared equally between MEC and Orange Bang.
 Under the arbitrator's order, if VPX fails to pay the royalty, VPX is prohibited from using the Bang mark, subject to certain limited exceptions. MEC and Orange Bang have filed a motion to confirm the arbitrator's award. VPX has filed a motion to vacate the arbitration award. A hearing on VPX's motion is scheduled for June 27, 2022.
 MEC's lawsuit against VPX for false advertising, unfair competition, and misappropriation of trade secrets in the Central District of California is still pending, with trials scheduled to begin in August 2022. As this litigation and other pending proceedings with VPX are subjudicate, we will not be answering any questions on those matters in today's call.
 In January of 2022, we introduced our first 16-ounce Ultra Variety 12 packs, which are being well received by consumers, and we are continuing to expand our multi-pack portfolio in the 2022 first quarter. In February of 2022, we introduced new flavor innovations with Ultra Peachy Keen, Juice Monster Aussie Style Lemonade, Rehab Watermelon and Reign Reignbow Sherbet.
 In February 2022, we launched our newest brand nationally, True North Pure Energy Seltzer in 4, 12-ounce flavors through the Coca-Cola distribution network.  At the end of the 2022, 1st quarter, we launched 2 new ready-to-drink nitro-infused coffee products, Java Monster Cold Brew Latte and Java Monster Cold Brew Sweet Black. In Canada, in January of 2022, we introduced Monster Ultra Gold. In February of 2022, we grew Canada's Reign portfolio by launching Reign White Gummy Bear.
 We successfully launched several new products across Latin America in the first quarter of 2022. In Argentina, we launched VR46 The Doctor. In Chile, we expanded our Reign Lemon by launching Melon Mania, Lemonades and Orange Dreamsicle. In Mexico, we launched our second Predator SKU with Predator Mean Green. We also launched Monster Ultra Gold in Puerto Rico and Monster Mango Loco in Colombia.
 In the 2022 first quarter, we launched Monster Ultra Gold and Mother Kiwi Sublime in Australia and New Zealand. We launched our third Super Fuel flavor in Tropical Thunder.
 In EMEA, in the first quarter of 2022, we launched Monster Mule, Monster Nitro and Monster Assault in a number of countries. We also launched Ultra Fiesta, Watermelon and Gold and Juiced Monarch, Khaotic and Pacific Punch in a number of countries during the 2022 first quarter.
 During the 2022 first quarter, we also launched Predator and Reign in additional countries. During the first quarter of 2020, we launched Monster Pipeline Punch in Singapore. We also introduced the Predator brand in India. In April 2022, we launched Monster Mango Loco in Japan. We are planning to introduce the Predator brand in several additional countries in APAC in the course of 2022.
 Our co-packing network is an integral part of the company's production model, which we intend to preserve. The owner of one of the co-packing facilities with which we contracted located in Norwalk, California, announced earlier this year that they would be selling this facility and ceasing its operations at this facility. To maintain adequate supply of the company's products, we have acquired the associated real property, leases and equipment of this co-packing facility for a purchase price of $62.5 million. Following the purchase, the facility will be closed for a period of time, before the company is able to commence production.
 We estimate April 2022 sales including CANarchy to be approximately 6.7% higher than in April 2021 and 4.8% higher than in April 2021, excluding CANarchy. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, excluding CANarchy, April 2022 sales would have been approximately 7.7% higher than the comparable April 2021 sales. April 2022 had 1 less selling day compared to April 2021.
 We mentioned that April 2022 sales had a challenging hurdle to meet over April 2021 sales. You may recall that in our 2021 first quarter conference call to shareholders, we estimated that April 2021 sales were approximately 71.3% higher than in April 2020. Please keep in mind that the comparative 2020 sales were materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In our 2020 first quarter conference call to shareholders, we estimated that April 2020 sales were 22.2% lower than our April 2019 sales. April 2021, April 2020 and April 2019, all had the same number of selling days.
 The company had sufficient can capacity and co-manufacturing filling capacity across all regions to address demand for April. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches, and the timing of price increases, and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production, and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers, as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.
 We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue in certain regions, our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed.
 In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. The company continues to address challenges in its supply chain by sourcing cans and primary ingredients and blends, increasing its manufacturing capacity and increasing finished product inventories. This should enable us to improve our service levels and lower transportation costs across North America, EMEA and LatAm. Our AFF's flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower landed costs to our EMEA region.
 We are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio. We are planning to continue additional launches of our Reign, Total Body Fuel high performance energy drinks in additional international countries. We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in an additional number of international countries.
 We are enthusiastic about the opportunities that CANarchy presents. While we believe that we will be able to address many of the supply chain challenges we have faced, we anticipate still having to face certain ongoing challenges in the future.  
 I would now like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. 
Dara Mohsenian: Your U.S. sales continue to come in very strong again this quarter, and show a sustained decoupling versus the scanner data, implying obviously very strong growth in the untracked channels. Can you just review for us what level of growth you're seeing in those untracked channels? What are the key drivers behind it?
 And then as we think about the U.S. going forward, can you discuss your thoughts on potential Monster top line weakness or category weakness, if we do see a consumer spending slowdown? And if you think we've seen any demand impact so far from higher gas prices? 
Hilton Schlosberg: So Dara, turning to your first question, there's always a disconnect between our sales, which are sales in the main to distributors and as well, we sell, obviously, to some direct accounts, including the untracked channels. It's really difficult for us to get that information to this investor group. There will always -- all I can say is there will always be a disconnect. And Nielsen is not a true indication even for sales through the distributor system, because the lags in the distribution system as well.
 And then turning to your second question about gas prices. We've seen this before. We've seen gas prices moving up, and we've seen sales of energy drinks really staying the course. And at the end of the day, remember that we have a business that is based on a brand, that is a lifestyle brand, and consumers purchase the Monster product because it's part of what they believe to be, and it's what they want to be. It's not something that's necessarily that price-sensitive and that made us kind of feel confident about our decision to take up pricing later this year. We've really took pricing up, as we mentioned, through pricing actions, and we will be taking pricing up effective September 1. 
Rodney Sacks: The only thing I would maybe add just from 1 aspect. Traditionally, the convenience channel was growing more quickly for the energy category than the mainstream grocery and drug channels. And in recent quarters, that had been reversed with less -- lower driving through COVID and then you've got higher gas prices.
 So I mean, at the moment, if you look at the latest 4 weeks or 1-week numbers, the convenience channel is growing less than if you look at the all major channels. But I think that's something that we've managed to achieve the results. We have -- despite that and despite the fact that, in fact, convenience is our largest channel, which I just think is positive for the future, because we think that will ride itself eventually when gas prices sort of normalize and/or people just get used to the gas prices and becomes whatever the level is, people will get used to it eventually and continue to drive. 
Hilton Schlosberg: If you look, for example, at the last 2 weeks, Nielsen in convenience, April the 16, we're seeing Nielsen sales in convenience for the energy category growing at 4.8%. And we're seeing the following week, which is April 23, which is what we discussed on this call, convenience in that 1-week growing 7%.
 So the market will continue to grow. As I said earlier, Monster is an affordable luxury, and we don't anticipate at this time seeing a dramatic falloff in sales in the convenience and gas channel. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. 
Andrea Teixeira: Rodney, on the 6% price increase starting in September in the U.S., I'm assuming that's on top of the 3% average that you had in Q1. And is that across -- it's great, and is that across all products and channels or balanced with RGM? And what are you hearing from retailers in terms of competitors following or not? 
Hilton Schlosberg: So that price increase is in addition to the pricing actions that we took in the first quarter that we started taking in the last quarter of 2021, and will continue through this year. So we have taken pricing actions. We'll continue to take pricing actions. September 1, there will be a market-wide increase. And we said approximately 6% depending on channel. And so far, we have not heard any rumblings from competitors about what they're doing and what they're not doing. We haven't heard anything from retailers.
 But as I said on a previous call, we're running our own brand, irrespective of the competitors. We believe in the power of our brand, and we have strong brands, and we believe that this pricing action is justified. And it's certainly justified in terms of all the costs, that we are seeing the cost increases and no doubt, our competitors are seeing the same cost increases. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. 
Bonnie Herzog: So you guys called out certainly many pressures this quarter impacting your business to really fill the strong underlying demand. Yet, I just wanted to circle back, because I thought you guys had made some progress in some of the distribution inefficiencies such as maybe already purchasing more supply in the U.S. during the quarter as well as started to operate back within your orbit. So maybe touch on that for us, please?
 And then, Rodney, can you help us understand maybe where things stand now as it relates to some of these pressures. Have they already started to ease? You mentioned a few things, but just trying to confirm that you've already seen improvement or is it really going to take until the second half until we see improvements on your gross margins?
 And then finally, I'd be curious to hear how much stronger your sales might have been in the quarter if you could have supplied enough product to fill a strong consumer demand? If you could quantify that for us, that would be helpful. 
Hilton Schlosberg: Let me just deal with the first part of your question, Bonnie, and then we can obviously get Rodney's input on the rest.
 As we look at the quarter, remember, the Ukraine conflict started on February the 24. So we had a dramatic increase in fuel prices, which we really didn't forecast. And we also had a dramatic increase in aluminum prices. And if you just look at aluminum prices, aluminum, the commodity went up 65% in Q1 '22 versus the previous year Q1 2021. So there were unexpected issues that surfaced in the quarter.
 I think we said at the time that we were building up inventories and that's what we've been doing. We've absolutely been building up inventories in the quarter, and you'll see that reflected in our balance sheet. We're probably in a good position now, better than we have been in terms of supply. And as we also said on this call is that April, we did not have a shortage of containers or product to any significant degree. So we're as well placed as we have been in the past to satisfy demand. 
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. 
Kevin Grundy: Two, if I could. Just to come back to the 6% pricing, which is certainly a step in the right direction, but not nearly enough to cover the inflationary pressures that you've seen over the past couple of years. Maybe just comment on the magnitude of it, how you arrived at that, why you believe that's the appropriate number?
 And then with respect to the April sales update and not to overweight any one given month, and your point in the comparison is entirely fair. But anything that you're seeing within the business that gives you any concern about underlying demand. It certainly doesn't sound that way, but I just wanted to ask given the step-down from what we saw from very strong results in the quarter. 
Hilton Schlosberg: Remember the hurdle we had in '21, that was probably one of the biggest hurdles we've seen. And -- so I think that April, as we've always said, 1-month in isolation should not be construed as indicative of performance for a quarter or a longer period of time.
 The way we got to our price increase is -- price increase, remember, we're already taking pricing actions. And we look at a whole bunch of factors, and there's a whole lot of factors that we take into account in determining where we should be. And obviously, price points are a big driver. And what we believe is fair and that the consumer will bear, that becomes a very big factor in assessing the price points and then, of course, assessing the extent of the price increase. 
Operator: The next question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel. 
Mark Astrachan: I guess just a short question. So anything preventing the company from buying stock back once the quiet period post the Q filing is complete? 
Hilton Schlosberg: No. It's a short answer. 
Rodney Sacks: You've answered it. We will be recommencing some buying activities. 
Hilton Schlosberg: It's a short question and short answer. 
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks. 
Rodney Sacks: Thanks very much. On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continue to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad, and in particular, to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally. We believe that we are well positioned in the beverage industry and continue to be optimistic about the future of our company. We hope that you will stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your attendance. 
Operator: Conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-24 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Company's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Rodney Sacks and Hilton Schlosberg, Co-CEOs. Please go ahead.
Rodney Sacks : Thanks. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thanks for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, is on the call; as is Tom Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will now read our cautionary statement.
Tom Kelly: Now before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended and are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends as well as the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's business and operations. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2021, including the sections contained therein Risk Factors and forward-looking statements for discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks.
Rodney Sacks : Thanks, Tom. The company achieved record fourth quarter and full year net sales with annual net sales topping the $5.5 billion mark for the first time in the company's history. Despite certain challenges in the 2021 fourth quarter, the company achieved solid results overall. We note that the comparative 2020 fourth quarter included a nonrecurring tax benefit of $165.1 million as well as reduced marketing, sponsorships and certain other operating expenses, largely as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. These items should be taken into consideration when evaluating comparative performance over the 2020 fourth year and full year, -- fourth quarter and full year. During the 2021 fourth quarter, the company continued to procure additional quantities of aluminum cans from suppliers in the United States and abroad in response to increased consumer demand. In addition, the company continued to experience additional global supply chain challenges, including freight inefficiencies, shortages of shipping containers, port of entry congestion and delays in the receipt of certain ingredients. In the United States, the company lacked sufficient co-packing capacity to meet increased demand for certain of its products. As a result, the company was not able to fully satisfy increased demand for its products in a number of markets in the 2021 fourth quarter. During the 2021 fourth quarter, the company experienced increased aluminum can costs attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing as well as the cost of importing aluminum cans. In addition, the company experienced increased ingredient and other input costs, including shipping and freight, labor, trucking, fuel, co-packing fees, secondary packaging materials, increased outbound freight costs and production and efficiencies, which resulted in increased costs of sales and increased operating costs in the 2021 fourth quarter. The company continues to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment. In the fourth quarter of 2021, net sales were $1.43 billion compared with $1.20 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of 19.1%. Adjusting for foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2021 fourth quarter would have been up 19.3%. The comparative net sales for the 2020 fourth quarter were negatively impacted by $15.2 million related to prior returns from our customers as a result of a European formulation issue with a limited number of products in Europe and labeling issue concerning 1 product in Japan, which we will refer to as the 2020 product returns. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2021 fourth quarter was 53.9% compared with 57.7% in the 2020 fourth quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2021 fourth quarter was primarily the result of increased freighting costs, increased aluminum can costs attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing, geographical and product sales mix and production inefficiencies. Operating expenses for the 2021 fourth quarter were $334.7 million compared with $288.4 million in the 2020 fourth quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2021 fourth quarter were 24.9% compared with 24.1% in the 2020 fourth quarter and 28.9% in the 2019 fourth quarter pre-COVID. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased outbound freight and warehouse costs, increased expenditures for sponsorships and endorsements and increased expenditures for other marketing activities including social media and digital marketing and increased payroll costs. During the comparative 2020 fourth quarter, the company decreased expenditures for sponsorship and endorsements and decreased expenditures for travel and entertainment, each largely as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was less pronounced on our sales and marketing programs during the 2021 fourth quarter. Distribution costs for the 2021 fourth quarter increased to $69.8 million, which is an increase of 48.4% or 4.9% of net sales compared to $47 million or 3.9% of net sales in the 2020 fourth quarter and 3.5% of net sales in the 2019 fourth quarter. Operating income increased 2.6% to $412.9 million from $402.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. We believe that a portion of the increase in costs that we experienced in the quarter and the 2021 full year are likely to be transitory. With our 2 new suppliers of aluminum cans in the United States operational, we will begin to decrease our reliance on the use of imported aluminum cans in the United States, although we will continue to import aluminum cans into the United States, although at a reduced level in the first half of 2022. In 2022, we expect to continue to import aluminum cans into EMEA reducing such imports in the second half of 2022. The supply chain challenges we are experiencing are significantly increasing and the logistic costs of importing and shipping raw materials and ingredients as well as other freighting costs, which are included in cost of sales. The cost of repositioning finished products to distribution centers are included in freight-in costs. We are rebuilding and increasing inventories in an effort to reduce the excessive cost of trucking long distances to satisfy demand and to return to our Orbitz strategy of producing in proximity to our customers. Increased freight in costs, including the shipment cost of importing cans amounted to approximately $38 million in the 2021 fourth quarter and approximately $100 million for the 2021 full year. Our out-of-orbit freight costs, which are included in distribution expenses amounted to approximately $15 million in the 2021 fourth quarter and $54 million for the 2021 full year. Net income decreased 31.9% to $321.3 million as compared to $471.7 million in the 2020 comparable quarter. Net income for the 2020 fourth quarter was positively impacted by the recognition of a nonrecurring tax benefit of approximately $165.1 million. Net income for the comparative 2020 fourth quarter, excluding the nonrecurring tax benefits, the impact of the 2020 product returns, associated inventory provisions and other related costs was $328.6 million. Diluted earnings per share for the 2021 fourth quarter decreased 32.1% to $0.60 from $0.88 in the fourth quarter of 2020. Diluted earnings per share for the comparative 2020 fourth quarter excluding the nonrecurring tax benefit, the impact of the 2020 product returns, associated inventory provisions and other related costs was $0.62. According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through February 12, 2022, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 13.3% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of the company's energy brands, including Reign, were up 8.1% in the 13-week period. Sales of Monster were up 10.5%. Sales of Reign were down 1.7%. Sales of NOS decreased 12.5% and sales of Full Throttle increased 12.4%. The decrease in sales of NOS retail during the fourth quarter was as a result of shortages in the supply of concentrate for NOS. The NOS supply issues are improving. Sales of Red Bull increased 13.8%. Sales of Rockstar decreased by 1.3% and sales of 5-Hour increased 2.1%. Sales of VPX Bang increased 0.4%. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended February 1, 2022, and sales in dollars in the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased 7.4% over the same period the previous year. Sales of the company's energy brands, which include Reign increased 4% in the 4-week period in the convenience and gas channel. Sales of Monster increased by 5.7% over the same period versus the previous year. Reign sales decreased 0.9% and NOS sales was down 10.8% and Full Throttle was up 6.3%. Sales of Red Bull were up 8.3%, Rockstar was down 4.5% and 5-Hour was down 1.3%. VPX Bang's sales decreased 4%. According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended February 12, 2022, the company's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, decreased 1.2 points to 37.2%. Monster share decreased 0.5 a share point to 31.6%. Reign's share decreased 0.2 of a share point to 2.4%. NOS' share decreased a 0.5 of a point 2.5% and Full Throttle share remained at 0.8%. Red Bull's share increased 0.3 points to 36.2%. Rockstar's share was down 0.5 a point to 4%. 5-Hour share was lower by 0.4 of 4.5%. And VPX Bang share decreased 0.8 of a points to 7%. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended February 12, 2022, sales in dollars in the coffee plus energy drink category, which includes our Java Monster line in the convenience and gas channel increased 2.3% over the same period the previous year. Sales of Java Monster including Java Monster 300 were 4.2% higher in the same period versus the previous year. Sales of Starbucks Energy were 0.7 of a percent higher. Java Monster's share including Java Monster 300 of the coffee -- plus energy category, which primarily includes Java Monster, Java Monster 300, Starbucks Doubleshot and Tripleshot, Rockstar Roasted and Bang Keto Coffee, for the 4 weeks ended February 12, 2021, was 53.7%, up 1 point, while Starbucks Energy share was 44.1%, down 0.7 of a point. According to Nielsen, in all measured channels in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended January 29, 2022, the energy drink category increased 12.3% in dollars. Sales of the company's energy drink brands increased 10.8% versus a year ago. The market share of the company's energy drink brands was 40.8%, down 0.6 of a point. Monster sales increased 13.9% and its market share increased to 0.5 points to 36.3%. NOS sales decreased 7.2% and its market share decreased 0.3 point to 1.6%. Full truffle sales decreased 25.4% and its market share decreased 0.3 of 0.25%. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category increased 25.9% for the month of January 2022. Monster sales increased 24.5%. Monster's market share in value decreased 0.3 points to 27.8% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Predator increased 38.3% and its market share increased 0.3 of a share point to 3.1%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by 1 or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen for the month of January 2022 compared to January 2021, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 41.3% to 43.8%. Monster Energy continues to be the leading energy brand in value in Argentina. According to Nielsen, for the month of January 2022 compared to January 2021, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Brazil from 32.2% to 37.8%. In Chile, Monster's retail share for the month of January 2022 decreased from 47.2% to 33.1% due to a shortage of shipping containers. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country-to-country. In addition, the company experienced supply issues in EMEA during 2021, which impacted the Nielsen statistics in different countries. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending January 29, 2022, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 27.3% to 29.5% in Great Britain, from 7.9% to 8.1% in the Netherlands and from 36.8% to 38.4% in Spain. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year declined from 15.3% to 14.2% in Belgium and from 31.1% to 30.3% in France, and from 20.1% to 19.3% in Poland. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending January 2, 2022, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 26.4% to 26.5% in Denmark from 15.1% to 15.8% in Germany and from 14.5% to 14.6% in Sweden. Whilst the retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year declined from 27.9% to 27% in Italy from 29.3% to 25.3% in Norway, and from 28.3% to 27.6% in the Republic of Ireland. According to Nielsen for the 13-week period ending December 31, 2021, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 15.2% to 15.6% in the Czech Republic, from 37.4% to 38% in Greece and from 20.4% to 20.5% in South Africa. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until the end of December 2021, Predators retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 12.9% to 20.8% in Kenya and from 1.9% to 14.4% in Nigeria. According to IRI in Australia, Monster's market share in value for the month ending February 6, 2022, increased from 12.2% to 12.8% as compared to the same period the previous year. Mother's market share in value decreased from 11.8% to 11% during the same period. The market share of the company's brands in Australia for the month ended February 6, 2022, decreased from 24% to 23.8%. According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the 4 weeks ended February 6, 2022, increased from 11.6% to 13.3% as compared to the same period the previous year. Live+ market share in value remained the same at 7.1% and Mother's market share in value decreased from 6.3% to 6%. The market share of the company's brands in New Zealand for the 4 weeks ended February 6, 2022, increased from 25% to 26.4%. According to INTAGE in Japan, for the month ended January 2022, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 50.8% to 56.3%. According to Nielsen, in South Korea for the month of December ended December 2021, Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined as compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 56.5% to 60.2%. Monster continues to be the leading energy brand in Japan and South Korea. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or 4-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $508.1 million, which is 35.7% of total net sales in the 2021 fourth quarter compared to $384.8 million or 32.2% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2020. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $2.4 million in the 2021 fourth quarter. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA, net sales in the 2021 fourth quarter increased 47.5% in dollars and increased 46.1% in local currencies over the same period in 2020. Net sales adjusted for the 2020 product returns in this region increased 41.2% in dollars and increased 39.9% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the fourth quarter was 32.6% compared to 30.2% in the same quarter in 2020. Gross profit in the fourth quarter was impacted by can freight and raw material airfreight costs. In local currencies, gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 32.2%. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, excluding the impact of the 2020 product returns in this region associated inventory provisions and other related costs was 40.1% for the 2020 fourth quarter. In 2021 fourth quarter, can supply shortages, lack of ingredient availability, it's sufficient canning capacity and a shortage of trucking availability together had an adverse impact on sales in EMEA. In some cases, impacting the availability of our products on shelf at retailers. However, the shortages of trucking availability will largely resolve in the latter part of the quarter. The company is continuing to address the controllable challenges in its supply chain in EMEA by continuing to import cans and expanding its co-packing capacity. We are also pleased that in the 2021 fourth quarter, Monster gained market share in the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, the Netherlands, South Africa, Spain and Sweden. In Asia Pacific, net sales in the 2021 fourth quarter increased 19.2% in dollars and increased 22.8% in local currencies over the same period in 2020. In Asia Pacific, excluding the impact of the 2020 product returns and the labeling issue in this region in the 2020 fourth quarter, net sales in the 2021 fourth quarter increased 10.7% in dollars and 14.1% in local currency over the same period in 2020. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 41.4% versus 34.8% over the same period in 2020. Excluding the impact of the 2020 product returns in this region, associated inventory provisions and related costs, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 40.3% in 2020. In Japan, net sales in the 2021 fourth quarter increased 12.7% in dollars and 20% in local currency. Without the impact of the 2020, product returns in Japan net sales decreased 1.2% in dollars and increased 5.2% in local currency over the same period in 2020, largely due to COVID-19 restrictions in Japan. In South Korea, net sales increased 31.3% in dollars and 35.5% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2020. Monster remains the market leader in Japan and South Korea. In China, net sales increased 22.6% in dollars and 17.6% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2020. We are reevaluating the optimal product range for China going forward. We remain optimistic about the prospects for the Monster brand in China. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 7.5% in dollars and 4.8% in local currencies due to timing of sales into bottlers. In Latin America, which includes Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the 2021 fourth quarter increased 17% in dollars and increased 21% -- 21.6% in local currencies over the same period in 2020. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 38.6% for both the 2021 and 2020 fourth quarters. In Brazil, net sales in the 2021 fourth quarter increased by 36.9% in dollars and 39.6% in local currency. Net sales in Chile increased 6% in dollars and 9% in local currency in the 2021 fourth quarter. Net sales in Argentina increased 30.7% in dollars and 66.7% in local currency in the 2021 fourth quarter. There are a number of pending proceedings with VPX but as they are subjudicate, we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today's call. In the United States, we launched our new True North Pure Energy Seltzer line in e-commerce and selected natural channels in the third quarter. In early 2022, we launched this said line nationally into mainstream channels with our Coca-Cola bottlers. In October 2021, we commenced the launch of our new reserve line of Monster Energy drinks in 2 flavors, Watermelon and White Pineapple. We have launched multiple innovation SKUs, 2 new 12-ounce flavors as well as new package configurations in the 2022 first quarter. This month, we launched 4 new flavor extensions in 16-ounce cans to the retail trade, namely Ultra Peachy Keen, Juice Monster Aussie Star Lemonade, Rehab Watermelon and Reign Rainbow Sherbet. In January 2022, we launched additional multipack options, such as 4-pack, Ultra Watermelon, a 4-pack Reign White Gummy Bear, 2 Ultra Variety packages in a 12-pack format. Additionally, we have launched 12-ounce 6 packs of Monster Energy, Zero Ultra, our new Peachy Keen Ultra, Java Monster Mean Bean and Java Monster Loca Mocha, Ultra Peachy Keen also launching in a 12-ounce option along with our Ultra Watermelon. In addition, Java Monster Nitro Cold Brew is scheduled to launch in the 2022 second quarter with 2 lower-calorie SKUs, Sweet Black and Latte. In the 2022 first quarter in Canada, we are planning to launch 9 new innovations, including the transition into a 355 ml 8-pack for Monster Energy, Zero Ultra and Ultra Paradise. In January 2022, we launched Ultra Gold in a 473 ml single can and 4-pack. We also launched Ultra Watermelon in a 4-pack and Ultra Paradise in a 710 ml can. We are in the process of launching a 4-pack Reign of Raspberry as well as introducing Reign White Gummy Bear in a 473 ml can. In the 2021 fourth quarter, we launched Monster Energy Mango Loco in Uruguay and Ecuador as well as Monster Ultra Watermelon and Predator Gold Strike in Trinidad. In Honduras, we expanded our Fury package offerings with the 355 mL returnable glass bottle. We are planning a national launch of Monster Pacific Punch, Monster Dragon Tea Peach, Reign, Orange Dreamsicle and Reign Mango Magic in Brazil in the first half of 2022. Additional 2022 first quarter LatAm innovations include Monster Zero Sugar in Ecuador, Pipeline Punch in Central America and Trinidad Monster Mango Loco in Peru and Colombia and VR46, the doctor in Argentina. In Chile, we are launching Reign Melon Mania, Reign Lemon Heads and Reign Orange Dreamsicle. In Mexico, we will introduce our second predator flavor with Predator Mean Green. In the 2021 fourth quarter in New Zealand, we launched Monster Ultra Fiesta Mango. In the 2022 first quarter, we launched Monster Ultra Gold and Mother Kiwi Sublime in Australia and are planning to launch Super Fuel Tropical Thunder in New Zealand. In EMEA, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we launched Monster Green, Monster Nitro and Monster Result in a number of countries. We also launched Ultra Watermelon, Golden Paradise and Juice Monarch Mango Loca and Pacific Punch in a number of countries during the 2021 fourth quarter. Monster Super Fuel Mean Green Watermelon and Subzero were launched in 2 countries in the fourth quarter of 2021. During the 2021 fourth quarter and 2022 first quarter, we also launched our Strategic Brands innovation and Predator in additional countries. In particular, we launched our Predator Spicy Ginger and Tropical in South Africa. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we launched Monster Rose in Japan in October, and the Predator brand in Vietnam in November 2021. We are planning to introduce the Predator brand in several additional countries in APAC in the course of 2022. We are planning to launch a number of additional products or product lines in our domestic and international markets later this year. On February 17, 2022, we completed our acquisition of CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective, a craft beer and hard sales for company for $330 million in cash subject to adjustments. The transaction brings the Cigar City, Jai Alai IPA and Florida Man IPA, Oskar Blues, Dale's Pale Ale and Wild Basin Hard Seltzer, Deep Ellum, Dallas Blonde and Deep Ellum IPA, Perrin Brewing, Black Ale, Squatters, Hop Rising Double IPA and Juicy IPA and Wasatch, Apricot Hefeweizen brands to our beverage portfolio. The transaction does not include CANarchy stand-alone restaurants. Our organizational structure for our existing energy beverage business will remain unchanged. CANarchy will function independently, retaining its own organizational structure and team. We are enthusiastic about the opportunities that this acquisition presents to us in the alcohol space and through their distribution network. We estimate January 2022 sales to be approximately 20.2% higher than in January 2021. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, January '22 sales would have been approximately 23% higher than the comparable January 2021 sales. January 2022 had 1 more selling day than in January 2021. Although we see some improvement, the company has continued to experience supply chain challenges in January, which adversely impacted sales. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month, should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue in certain regions, our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed. In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. Currently, the company's flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities and bottlers and distributors are all operating. The company continues to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment. We are continuing to experience increased costs in our operations, some of which may be transitory, and we have and are in the process of implementing reductions in promotions and other pricing actions in the United States and EMEA to mitigate against such increased costs. Our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is operational and is providing flavors to our EMEA region and will improve service levels in EMEA. We are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio. We are planning to continue additional launches of our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in additional international countries. We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in a number of international countries. Our supply chain challenges are improving. We are enthusiastic about the opportunities that CANarchy presents. I would like to now open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Kaumil Gajrawala from Credit Suisse.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Thank you operator. Hey everybody. You talked a lot about improved supply and the things you're doing to increase supply. Your margins obviously were down quite a bit, I think, 540 basis points. Speaking -- can you speak maybe more to margins as opposed to just availability of product and how we should be thinking about that within the context of some of the changes that are being made for '22?
Hilton Schlosberg: Well, Kaumil, I think that we've been through enlisted the supply chain challenges. And I'm not sure it's worthwhile repeating what we said earlier. But what we did mention on the call and gave some numbers was that the -- certain of those costs in the supply chain are expected to be transitory. And that is, for example, we do satisfy demand, we opened up what we regarded as orbits where we manufactured and distributed within specific geographies. And to satisfy demand, we had to open up those orbits. And the cost of that was pretty exceptional. And we detailed that, I think, on this call. Also to import cans from abroad is a very expensive exercise, as you can imagine. And that we see kind of mitigating in 2022. We have 2 new suppliers coming on stream and they aren't -- in fact, they are on stream. So we will be reducing our dependence on imported cans certainly in the U.S., and then we'll buy some cans, not to the same degree as we did in the first half. And the second half will be -- we believe we'll be self-sufficient with cans in the U.S. In EMEA, we'll continue to input cans, but they will kind of tail off in the second half of the year. So there are some of these costs that are transitory. Some of the costs may stick. There's been costs across the board, and we had a big shock this morning. As no doubt you guys did as well with aluminum, where aluminum plus the Midwest index went up to $1.97 a pound as opposed to what we were paying in last year of just kind of half of that. So there are a lot of costs that are coming to us. The cost that we can mitigate, the cost that we may not be able to mitigate. Now we'll aluminum stay at this level? I don't think anyone knows. So overall, I think we are navigating well through these supply chain challenges. And we're doing the very best we can to ensure that our customers receive product because at the end of the day, as I've always said to this audience, we bank dollars, we don't bank margins, and we have enough profitability in the system to be able to do what we've been doing and make a profit. And unfortunately, the result is that the GP percentage does come down, but we expect that this will not last forever and that margins will be back to some degree as we move forward.
Operator: The next question is from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Chris Carey: Hi, good evening everyone. Thank you for the question. I just wanted to follow up on that line. If I look at -- not to be so shortsighted in a way, but where The Street is modeling your gross margins, it's slightly up for 2022. But if I hear you right, if you have aluminum inflation still coming through, you're still going to be sourcing cans from other places. So you have freight costs. Pricing, as you noted, at the annual Investor Day, will be a positive to the story, but maybe not enough to offset this inflation. And so I just want to make sure I'm hearing right that the top line, of course, remains a very good story here, but the gross margins should remain under pressure in 2022 and then really building into 2023 as these costs are a bit transitory. And then if I could, just on the quarter-to-date number, is that mostly international versus the U.S., just given the disconnect to Nielsen sales. So thanks so much for that perspective.
Hilton Schlosberg: Well, let's go back to the -- your second question. That number -- the U.S. is very close to that number for January. So we can -- we have a lot of unmeasured channels in our system, and Nielsen is not always a good indicator of our sales to our distributors. So let's go -- if we can, let's take a step back and look at your -- and address your first question. So aluminum jumped up today significantly. It's been moving up I gave you the number as of today, as of yesterday, it was $0.10 a ton less than that. So with this war and everything else going on in the world, I can't say for certain, and I don't think anyone can tell you what aluminum is going to do and what it's going to be. And obviously, with most of our products being packaged in aluminum cans that is a significant item. Looking back at some of your other comments, I mentioned that -- we mentioned at least on the script that we have sufficient cans now. So we're able to start working towards closing off and close going back to the orbits, which means that trading costs should significantly reduce. When? I can't say for certain, but it's going to happen. Other costs in the system are being controlled. And so what -- looking forward, I think that we will continue to have a difficult 2022. Will the margins stay at the level that we talked about on this call? I don't know. Honestly, a lot depends on what happens with aluminum. So the rest of the stuff is coming under control. I mentioned that we were importing less cans into the U.S. than we did in 2020. That will have a positive impact on margins from the second half of the year will be -- we believe, will be totally self-sufficient with cans in the U.S. So that's a positive factor. And then in EMEA, we will be importing cans in the first half with a significant reduction in the second half. So there's a lot of good things in the cost story, but unfortunately, it is what it is. On the sales side and price increases, we spoke about that. On previous calls, as you know, we have a play that we're running, irrespective, really, I think, of what Red Bull is doing, we've come to the conclusion that we're going to run our own play. We know what we want to do, and we're working on reducing promotional ounces. You've seen prices go up already in the trade, and you've seen them going up in Nielsen. So that is something that is happening as well. What else do I want to say? So we spoke about prices went up in the -- through reductions in promotional launches in the quarter that we look at, although at a very modest degree. And as we go through 2022, you'll see prices -- price increases in our business accelerating.
Operator: The next question is from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Andrea Teixeira: Hi, how are you. I just wanted to perhaps elaborate more on what you said, Hilton on the pricing front. Are you saying that you -- we should be able to see pricing be on what was passed through by top manufacturing at some point in 2022? And then regarding that, are you seeing any impact from the gas stations given the gas price is going up? Or this is not a concern for affordability at this point?
Hilton Schlosberg: So you've seen the convenience and gas numbers in Nielsen. They are somewhat lower than the rest of the market of recent. But we've been through higher gas prices before and they haven't really impacted sales. But we are seeing -- if you look at the Nielsen, you'll see that the numbers in convenience and gas in the energy category are reducing. So whether they'll stay at that level, I don't know. But we have been through this before, and we haven't seen a slowdown in sales and energy in the convenience and gas market. And then looking at pricing --
Rodney Sacks : Of a pickup may add -- sorry, just been a little bit of a pickup in the last week. If you look at the single last week's numbers, again, that's a very short period, but we are seeing a pickup in convenience with the price increase -- effective price increase, it still is translating. So we'll see how that extends.
Hilton Schlosberg: Yes, it's a 1-week number, sure. And with regard to pricing, we spoke about what we were doing to increase pricing. We're running our play. 24 ounces going up April 1 in low double-digit numbers. So that will be a nice percentage in 24 ounce. And the rest, we're working on, as you know, with our revenue growth management department working on taking promotional allowances down to achieve the same result as a price increase. But we're continuing to monitor whether we need to take a general price increase or not. And if we have to, we will and in particular, with regard to metal, and we don't know where metal is going. But with regard to metal, if it becomes a permanent situation, yes, then we probably have to reconsider and decide what else could be done on the pricing front, but we're not ruling out a general price increase.
Operator: The next question is from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Kevin Grundy: Good afternoon guys. I wanted to come back to your strategy on alcohol. So now with the CANarchy deal closed, do you think the company has the right product portfolio, distribution and capabilities at this point in time to deliver against your ambitions? You've been talking about this for the better part of two years and now with this deal closed, do you think you have everything that you need to deliver? And I guess, specifically, just to kind of drill down a little bit, do you think that you need more in terms of capabilities with respect to spirits, both consumer capabilities, a broader wholesaler distribution network? And if the answer to that is yes, how do you intend to sort of address that and is larger scale M&A a possibility?
Rodney Sacks : I think that the CANarchy acquisition is not the complete answer to everything. They are craft brands. They are -- they have a distribution network. They have some sales of brands. We do have a good infrastructure in staff there, and we have -- we're going to use that to build on. We are going to look at taking the distribution system, refining a little bit. We're looking at addressing their products and taking steps to invigorate their sales and looking at our own products that we've been developing, that we have discussed previously and taking and deciding where to and help to launch those through the CANarchy system. And we will separately address the possible M&A of additional brands, whether in a -- sort of in the malt side, the beer side or the spirit side. Those are things that are opportunities. But again, we're looking at the whole business now and reviewing it, but it's the platform that is really good for us. And I think that is what is -- that's the function that's going to serve for us. We are going to obviously have to address issues and other matters in getting that fully implemented. It's not just a perfect system that we've taken over. But it's a good base for us, and we're going to build on it, and we're very confident and we're very pleased with having closed that acquisition, which will give us the springboard from here on.
Operator: The next question is from Vivien Azer of Cowen. Please go ahead.
Vivien Azer: Hi, good evening. Thank you for the questions. I was wondering if you could just offer some better detail on your supply chain in Russia, in the Ukraine and if you could quantify your exposure to those two countries, please?
Hilton Schlosberg: Yes. Well, those countries, including Belarus, in Kazakhstan, which really work within that region account for about 10% of our sales in our EMEA sales. So we have a nice business in Russia, which -- we have to see what happens there, and we have a reasonable business in Ukraine. We have staff and we have people in those countries. And it's really concerning is to -- we don't know what will happen, and it's really concerning, frankly.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Rodney Sacks and Hilton Schlosberg for closing remarks.
Rodney Sacks : Thank you. On behalf of the company, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continue to innovate, to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad, and in particular, to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally. We believe that we are well positioned in the beverage industry and continue to be optimistic about the future of our company. We hope that you will stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-11-04 17:00:00) =====
Company Representatives: Rodney Sacks - Co-CEO Hilton Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, Co-CEO Tom Kelly - Chief Financial Officer

The company assumes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you, Tom. Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company achieved record third quarter net sales. During the 2021 third quarter, the company procured additional quantities of aluminum cans from supplies in the United States, South America and Asia in response to increased consumer demand. However the company continued to experience shortages in its aluminum can requirements in the United States and EMEA during the 2021 third quarter.  In addition, the company continued to experience additional supply chain challenges, including freight inefficiencies, trucking availability, shortages of shipping containers, port of entry congestion, insufficient co-packing capacity and delays in receiving certain ingredients in the United States and EMEA. As a result the company was not able to fully satisfy increased demand in the United States and EMEA in the 2021 third quarter.  During the 2021 third quarter, the company continued to experience increased aluminum can costs attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing and costs of importing aluminum cans. In addition the company experienced increased ingredient and import costs, including shipping and freight, labor, trucking, fuel, co-packing fees and secondary packaging materials, and increased outbound freight costs, all of which resulted an increased cost of sales and increased operating costs in the 2021 third quarter.  The company continues to address the challenges in its supply chain, as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment. We are experiencing increased costs in our operations, some of which are likely to be transitory, and we have and are in the process of implementing reductions and promotions, and other pricing actions in the United States and EMEA to mitigate such increased costs.  In the third quarter of 2021, net sales were $1.41 billion compared with $1.25 billion in the third quarter of 2020, an increase of 13.2%. Adjusting for foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2021 third quarter would have been up 11.9%.  Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2021 third quarter was 55.9% compared with 59.1% in the 2020 third quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2021 was primarily the result of increased aluminum can costs, attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing, as well as the cost of importing aluminum cans, logistical costs and geographical sales mix.  Operating expenses for the 2021 third quarter were $344.7 million compared to $277.9 million in the 2020 third quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2021 third quarter were 24.4% compared to 22.3% in the 2020 third quarter and 24.5% in the 2019 third quarter pre-COVID.  In particular, operating costs were adversely affected by increased logistical inefficiencies, including higher freight-out and warehousing costs, a one-time distributor termination fee of $5.3 million and increased selling and marketing expenses, including the resumption of certain sponsorship and deviant activities as compared to the same quarter last year. A number of sponsorship activities were canceled in the comparable quarter last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Operating income increased 3.1% to $444.5 million from $458.6 million in the third quarter of 2020, primarily driven by increased import costs, increased transportation, increased selling expenses and a one-time distributor termination fee of $5.3 million. Net income decreased 3% to $337.2 million as compared to $347.7 million in the 2020 comparable quarter.  Diluted earnings per share for the 2021 third quarter decreased 3.5% to $0.63 from $0.65 in the third quarter of 2020. According to Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through October 23, 2021, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots increased by 12.8% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of the company’s energy brands, including Reign were up 7.1% in the 13-week period. Sales of Monster were up 10.7%. Sales of Reign were down 7.6%. Sales of NOS decreased 18.3% and sales of Full Throttle increased 8.9%. It is important to note that with regard to the decrease in sales of NOS, during the third quarter we experienced shortages in the supply of concentrate for NOS, which resulted in reduced production, reduced sales and lack of product availability at retail. The NOS supply issues are improving. Sales of Red Bull increased 15.6%. Sales of Rockstar decreased by 12.5%, and sales of 5-Hour increased 3%. VPX Bang sales increased 5.1%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended October 23, 2021, sales in dollars in the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increased 8.8% over the same period the previous year. Sales of the company’s energy brands which include Reign increased 4.3% in the four-week period in the convenience and gas channel. Sales of Monster increased by 7.4% over the same period versus the previous year. Reign sales decreased 6.7%, NOS’s sales were down 17.5%, and Full Throttle was up 7.8%. Sales of Red Bull were up 13.1%, Rockstar was down 14.7%, and 5-Hour was up 1.9%. VPX Bang sales increased 3.4%.

Monster’s market share in value decreased 2.5 points to 26.2% against the comparable period the previous year.  Sales of Predator, which was launched in March 2020 increased 95.1% and its market share increased 1 share point to 2.8%.

Amp’s sales increased 55.5%, and its market share increased 3.4 points to 18.2%.  The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO circle convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen for the month of September 2021 compared to September 2020, Monster’s retail market share in-value increased in Argentina from 44.2% to 47.6%. Monster Energy continues to be the leading energy brand in value in Argentina. Monster’s retail market share in value increased in Brazil, from 33% to 37.6% and now trails Red Bull by only 3.3 points.  In Chile, although Monster’s net sales in the third quarter was 34% higher, its retail market share for the month of September decreased from 46.6% to 42.2%, due to robust growth in the energy category in Chile, which has growing 65% for the month of September 2021. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country-to-country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending October 10, 2021, Monster’s regional market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 13.5% to 13.6%; in Belgium, from 25.8% to 26.3% in France, from 25.4% to 29% in Great Britain, from 7.5% to 7.7% in the Netherlands, and from 35.8% to 36.7% in Spain.  According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until the end of September 2021, Monster’s retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 14.2% to 14.9% in Germany, from 37% to 38.6% in Greece and from 18.3% to 20.2% in South Africa. Monster’s retail market share in value is compared to the same period the previous year declined from 20.1% to 19.5% in Poland.

According to Nielson in the 13-week period ending August 31, 2021 Monster’s retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 13% to 14.6% in the Czech Republic, and from 19.9% to 29.1% in Italy.  In the 2021 third quarter, sales in EMEA were adversely impacted by can and concentrate supply issues and manufacturing capacity constraints, which caused out-of-stocks in many markets. The United Kingdom and certain other countries in EMEA were more adversely affected.  Truck shortages also exacerbated our ability to supply and the ability of our bottlers to deliver products to their customers. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period until the end of August 2021, Predator’s retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 9.8% to 18.6% in Kenya and from 0% to 12.2% in Nigeria. We launched our new Predator malt flavor energy drink in Nigeria during the third quarter. The Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to IRI in Australia, Monster’s market share in value for the month ending October 2021 increased from 12.7% to 13.9% as compared to the same period the previous year. Mother’s market share in value decreased from 11.9% to 11.3% during the same period. The market share of the company’s brands in Australia for the month ended October 2021 increased from 24.6% to 25.2%. According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster’s market share in value for the four weeks ended October 17, 2021, increased from 10.6% to 12.6% as compared to the same period of the previous year. Live+ market share in value decreased from 6.7% to 6.3%, and Mother’s market share in value increased from 5.6% to 6.1%. The market share of the company’s brands in New Zealand for the four weeks ended October 17, 2021, increased from 23% to 25%. According to INTAGE, in Japan, for the month ended September 21, 2021 Monster’s market share in value in the convenience store channel as compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 49.9% to 53.9%. According to Nielsen in South Korea, for the month ended September 21, 2021, Monster’s market share in value in all outlets combined as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 54.4% to 60.4%. Monster continues to be the leading energy brand in Japan and South Korea.  We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or four week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. Net sales to customers outside of the U.S. were $527.4 million, 37.4% of total net sales in the 2021 third quarter compared to $444.5 million or 35.7% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2020.  Foreign currency exchange rates had a positive impact on net sales in the U.S. dollars by approximately $16.4 million in the 2021 third quarter. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company’s military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA, net sales in the 2021 third quarter increased 22.9% in dollars and increased 17.2% in local currencies over the same period in 2020. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the third quarter was 37.7% compared to 39.5% in the same quarter in 2020, primarily due to an unfavorable country product mix and canned freight and raw material air freight costs. In local currencies, gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 38.4%.  Can supply shortages exacerbated by production disruptions at a major supplier in EMEA, lack of ingredient availability, insufficient canning capacity and a shortage of trucking availability, together had an adverse impact on sales in the third quarter in EMEA, in some cases impacting the availability of our products on shelf at retailers. The company has addressed and continues to address the controllable challenges in its supply trend.  We are also pleased that in the 2021 third quarter Monster gained market share in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden. In Asia Pacific, net sales in the 2021 third quarter decreased 1.6% in dollars and decreased 2.2% in local currencies over the same period in 2020, largely due to sales in Japan and China. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 43.5% versus 43.2% over the same period in 2020. In Japan, net sales in the 2021 third quarter decreased 0.7 of a percent in dollars and 1.7% in local currency, largely due to COVID-19 restrictions in Japan and distributor inventory adjustments. In South Korea, net sales increased 21.1% in dollars and 15.6% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2020. Monster remains the market leader in Japan and South Korea. In China net sales decreased 13.5% in dollars and 20.4% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2020. We are re-evaluating the optimal product range for China going forward. We remain optimistic about the prospects for the Monster brand in China.  In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales decreased 8.6% in dollars and 13.6% in local currencies due to timing of sales into bottlers.  In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the 2021 third quarter increased 57.6% in dollars and increased 57.7% in local currencies over the same period in 2020. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 41% compared to 42.9% over the same period in 2020. In Brazil, net sales in the 2021 third quarter increased by 56.6% in dollars and 54.1% in local currency. Net sales in Chili increased 34.5% in dollars and 27.4% in local currency in the 2021 third quarter. Net sales in Argentina increased 41.6% in dollars and 93.1% in local currency in the 2021 third quarter. There are a number of pending proceedings with VPX, but as they are subjudicate, we will not be answering any questions on this measure on today’s call.  In the United States we successfully launched our new True North pure energy salsa line in ecommerce and selected channels, and will launch nationally into mainstream channels with our Coca-Cola bottlers in the first quarter of 2022.  In October 2021 we commenced the launch of our new reserve line of monster energy drinks in two flavors, watermelon and white pineapple. In Canada, during July 2021 we successfully launched our monster energy Rehab line in three flavors. We have Tea Plus lemonade, Peach Tea and Strawberry Lemonade.  We successfully launched several new products across Latin America in the third quarter of 2021, including Monster Energy Zero Ultra in Paraguay, Monster Energy Zero Sugar in Peru, Monster Ultra Fiesta Mango in Puerto Rico and Monster Ultra Watermelon in the Caribbean. In the 2021 third quarter we expanded our presence at Gold Strike footprint in Mexico by launching in a 355 ML slim can. In Brazil we also launched Monster Pacific Punch, Monster Dragon Tea Peach, Reign Orange Dreamsicle and Reign Mango Magic within a limited territory. We are planning a national launch of all of these products in the first quarter of 2022.  In the 2021 third quarter in Australia we launched two new products in Mother Sugarfree Razzle Berry and Monster Ultra Fiesta Mango. In the third quarter of 2021 we launched Monster Mule, Monster Nitro and Monster Assault in a number of countries in EMEA. We also launched Ultra Fiesta and Juiced Monster Monarch in a number of countries during the 2021 third quarter. During the quarter we also launched our strategic brands innovation and Predator in additional countries. In particular, we launched our Predator malt flavored energy drink in Nigeria. During the third quarter 2021 we launched Monster Super Fuel, Blue Streak and Red Dog in July in Japan. Additionally in October 2021 we re-launched Monster Rossi in Japan.  As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic still impacting the region, certain of our planned launches of new products in a number of Asia Pacific markets have been deferred until 2022. However, Predator is anticipated to launch later this month in Vietnam. We are planning to launch a number of additional products and/or product lines in our domestic and international markets later this year.  We estimate October 2021 sales to be approximately 8.3% higher than in October 2020. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, October 2021 sales would have been approximately 7.9% higher than the comparable October 2020 sales. October 2021 had one less selling day than October 2020.  Additionally, the company continued to experience multiple supply chain challenges in October, which adversely impacted sales. In this regard we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production.  In some instances where our bottles are responsible for production and literally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers, as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.  We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue in certain regions, our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed.  In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Currently the company's flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities and bottlers and distributors are all operating. The company continues to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment.  We are experiencing increased costs in our operations, some of which are likely to be transitory and we have and are already in the process of implementing reductions in promotions and other pricing actions in the United States and EMEA to mitigate such increased costs.  Our AFA flavor facility in Ireland is operational and is providing flavors to our EMEA region, which would improve service levels in the EMEA. We are pleased with the new additions to the monster energy portfolio. We are planning to continue additional launches of our Reign Total Body Fuel high performance energy drinks in additional international countries.  We are pleased with the roll out of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We're proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in a number of international countries. I’d like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
Operator:  Our first question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Please go ahead.
Wendy Nicholson : Hi! My question has to do with how you're thinking about pricing and promotion, because on the one hand you've got strong market shares, it seems like strong demand, yet you've got capacity constraints and supply chain constraints. So on the one hand you want to keep promotion up to keep people coming to your brand, but if you can't service demand how do you balance those two. If you could talk about what you are thinking about just in the short term over the next few months, how you scale up supply and get more bottles on the shelf, more cans on the shelf. 
Hilton Schlosberg: Okay Wendy, this is Hilton. That's an excellent question. So we have a department called Revenue Growth Management that balances pricing and balances promotions in line with the expectations that we set for the business and for our brands. So we’ve been working very closely and started in this quarter, in fact slightly before this last quarter in cutting back promotions and using them very judiciously.  So we look at this on an ongoing basis. We have plans for 2022 which involves changing retail pricing on shelves, which leads to obesity reduction in promotions and we don't rule out the possibility of a full price increase later on in 2022. But we keep our options open. We prefer to accomplish the objectives through reductions in promotions, but we have to see what the cost environment looks like going into the 2022.  Obviously if you haven't got product and you showed a product that doesn't make sense to promote extensively, but we still have to promote in order to fulfill the contract that we've had this year with our customers and our retailers which was set at the beginning of the and so some cannot be changed and as we move into 2020, adjust pricing through promotions and/or price increases. 
Operator: The question is from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. 
Bonnie Herzog: Alright, thank you. Hi Rodney and Hilton! 
Hilton Schlosberg: Hey Bonnie! 
Tom Kelly: Hey Bonnie! 
Bonnie Herzog: Hi! I wanted to ask a little bit further on the points you're making about this, outsized demand and that you weren't able to satisfy this increased demand in the quarter and given the shortages. So is there any you guys could help quantify for us the impact that this had on you top line in both the U.S. and EMEA. I mean I'm just trying to understand is that, you know was it a low single digit impact on growth? Could it have been more like a mid-single digit improvement on your top online. 
Hilton Schlosberg: No, no. Is it one question or two? 
Bonnie Herzog: Okay, well that’s it. I just want to also understand if the situations improved in Q3 versus Q2. 
Hilton Schlosberg: Okay, so the situations did not improve in Q3 relative to Q2. Q3 really presented more challenges in supply chain as we anticipated. Although cans have come, we've achieved cans from overseas partners as we expected. So we have cans in the system, we have opened up a number of co-packers in the – which will be supplying in the fourth quarter. So if we look at Q3 and Rodney will probably kill me, but I’ll give you an estimate. My estimate is that we shorted in the high single digits; that's my estimate, in terms of millions of cases. 
Operator: The next question is from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please go ahead. 
Peter Galbo : Hey guys! Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I was just wondering Hilton, you know the comments on other pricing actions, you know retail pricing on shelves, potential for a full list price increase. Just can you give us a sense on maybe when you would consider that more thoroughly? Is there a reason why it's not now, is there a shelf reset period that you need to wait for. Just, you know listening to some of the commentary from some of the bottlers, it seems like they are taking pricing now. Just why wait? 
Hilton Schlosberg: So we are not waiting. I mean we already implemented promotional adjustments in this quarter, so we are not waiting. There are certain customers that we have, that we are contractually obligated to maintain pricing and promotions. We've entered into agreements with them that we have new contracts starting in 2022, and those new contracts will address the pricing issues that you're talking about.  So we are not waiting. It's already being implemented and some of it in the third quarter as I mentioned, more will fall in the fourth quarter and more will follow in Q1 of 2022. I think we've got a very interesting position in the market and we've got to be careful that whatever we do, we don't disturb the velocity of what our brand is doing at retail. 
Operator: The next question is from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead. 
Mark Astrachan: Yes, hey! Good afternoon guys. Hope all's well. I wanted to ask about the Coke relationship. So the can supply shortages, some of the manufacturing challenges that you've laid out in recent quarters, assuming distribution disadvantaged verses Red Bull self-distribution at least in the U.S., how do you think about your relationship with Coke, and importantly how does it get better and what makes it better from here. 
Hilton Schlosberg: Mark, perhaps I’ll take that one. I mean there are two different relationships, there is Coke as a corporate partner, and there's also the individual Coke bottlers. You know I think that our relationship with Coke is fine. I think there is no issue, it’s a good relationship.  I think that with the bottles are relationships again are also good. But I think the bottles have been struggling a little bit as you know with labor issues and cost issues as well. And that has sort of affected I think the level of service to smaller accounts and in field activities and that's why that has perhaps disproportionately hurt our brand over this whole pandemic period and that’s something that we are addressing, particularly when you compare that to, not against other similarly - similar systems, but as against Red Bull which has its own dedicated system out there.  And so we are taking steps to address that. We have our home fields’ force that we've implemented to supplement and assist the bottlers. We even had fuel filed forces suffering from labor issues and trying to hire people. It's not been easy, we have a number of open positions. But we are, actually we’ve seen good success from what we've implemented and we actually are expanding on filed team and we are going to do that in conjunction with the bottlers.  But that’s part of the challenges we've had in our supply chain and part of the challenges we've had which has affected our sales, have been you know just inefficiencies getting products on shelf. And there are different, different parts of the country and different parts of the world even, it varies and in some cases you see empty shelves or you see shelves that haven’t been refilled, which is obviously heart breaking for us and we try and address it. But that is something we are facing and that's been a labor issue that many of our bottlers are going through at the moment. But hopefully we are trying to work out ways of improving and hopefully that will start improving going forward.  But despite that, we've been able to continue to manage pretty healthy increase in sales and it's the, it’s just meeting the increased demand that has been our big challenge. And again, we are working with our bottles to try to achieve what we can.  So a tough environment for our bottlers, when also we can’t supply all of their orders and fill them in full, and that’s been difficult for us to juggle deliveries around the country, and it resulted in increased costs out of orbit and in delivering products out of our normal ranges in order to make sure we are trying to maximize deliveries to bottlers. 
Operator: The next question is from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. 
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good afternoon there. I wanted to just go back to the magnitude of pricing in your comments in the last earnings call. That you expect the cost pressures and supply challenge to abate in the fourth quarter. Are you still expecting that to be the case or sequentially quite worse and we should brace for something similar in the fourth quarter against the third quarter.  And just for clarification, you said high single digit million cases impact or you said high single digit percentage impact that would have been?
Hilton Schlosberg: No, no, no million cases. 
Andrea Teixeira: Okay, that’s a mid-single digit impact, okay. 
Hilton Schlosberg: No, well in cases it’s a high, just to be clear it's a high number of cases in millions, in the high single digits. 
Andrea Teixeira: And on the pricing Hilton, can you let us know the magnitude that you're trying to put through and how we should think about cogs into the fourth quarter. 
Hilton Schlosberg: Right, so if you look at where we are with cogs, it’s really a difficult situation right now, because I don't know where for example aluminum is going. I think those of you who are tracking aluminum, will know that the aluminum price is significantly, the LME and the Midwest premium is significantly higher than last year. In fact it's up by almost 70% from the - from the similar quarter in the previous year.  So and then I’ll turn to what's happened in aluminum. So in the middle of October we ended up with the highest price we've ever seen for aluminum in the Midwest Premium and that's now fallen 15% from its high and now it’s like the end of October.  So we don't know what's happening with aluminum. What we do know is that we have substantial quantities of cans; we have two new manufactures that have opened in the U.S. and are beginning to supply us. So that's a fact and we have also opened a number of additional co-packing facilities both in the U.S. and in Europe.  So the cans are coming in, we have new co-packing capacity and what I'm hoping is that this inefficient freight that we've been experiencing, you know we spoke on previous calls about operating within orbits to minimize cost of distribution and cost of freight in. So now we've broken those orbits, because we haven't had capacity and we've been anxiously trying to service every case we can.  So I'm hoping that in the fourth quarter and it's October really, that with these new co-packers opening up, that with the can capacity that we have, that we will start mitigating these inefficient freight costs that we are experiencing. But you know I can't talk about aluminum, because I don't know what's happening with aluminum and we were very careful not to buy forward on aluminum which, we normally do as our can companies, because we were nervous about what was going to happen. So that's where we are in the fourth quarter.  Certainly things are improving, but I cannot say that they are totally solved. And in Europe we've opened up also a number of new co-packers. We’re getting cans in Europe from India and from China, so even the European situation is being elevated. I would say if you compare it to the third quarter, I suspect we will have less issues in the fourth quarter than we have had in the third quarter, if that answers your question.

Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks. 
Rodney Sacks : Thank you. On behalf of the company I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. And in particular expend distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottler system internationally.  We believe that we are well positioned in the energy drink category and continue to be optimistic about our total portfolio of energy drink brands. We hope that you will stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your attendance. 
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-08-05 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Company Second Quarter 2021 Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rodney Sacks, Co-CEO, to begin the call. Please go ahead.
Rodney Sacks: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I’m Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, is on the call; as is Tom Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom Kelly will now read our cautionary statement.
Tom Kelly: Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Act of 1934, as amended, and are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends, as well as the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company’s business and operations.

The company assumes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you, Tom. The company’s top priority remains the health, safety and well-being of its employees. The company’s flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities have operated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The company’s bottlers and distributors are operating, and the company’s products remain generally available to consumers. In limited countries, the operations of the company’s bottlers and distributors have, in part, been negatively affected for varying periods of time. Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company achieved record second quarter net sales. Currently, the company does not foresee a material impact on the ability of its co-packers to manufacture and its bottlers and distributors to distribute its products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company’s supply chain remains largely intact. However, the company continues to experience shortages in its aluminum can requirements in the United States and EMEA, given the company’s volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. The company is also experiencing delays in procuring certain ingredients, both domestically and internationally. As a result, the company was unable to fully satisfy demand in the 2021 second quarter in the United States and EMEA. We expect such challenges to continue for the next few months. The company has taken steps to source additional quantities of aluminum cans from the United States, South America and Asia. The company has entered into new supply agreements with two new aluminum can suppliers in the United States, and which are expected to be operational in the 2021 fourth quarter. We expect deliveries of additional quantities of cans increasing sequentially during the latter part of the year. Logistical issues, including shortages of shipping containers and port of entry congestion could delay ongoing international supply of aluminum cans. Separately, we are continuing to experiencing – experience freight inefficiencies as well as significant increases in domestic and international freight costs and like other beverage companies are incurring increased aluminum can and other costs in the current environment, all of which in addition to other factors, will continue to adversely impact gross margin percentages. In the second quarter of 2021, net sales were $1.46 billion, compared with $1.09 billion in the second quarter of 2020, an increase of 33.6%. Adjusting for foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2021 second quarter would have been up 30.1%. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2021 second quarter was 57.2% compared with 60.3% in the 2020 second quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2021, was primarily the result of geographical sales mix and increased input costs, mainly increased raw material freight in costs and aluminum can costs. Operating expenses for the 2021 second quarter were $310.9 million, compared with $252.2 million in the 2020 second quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2021 second quarter were 21.3%, compared with 23.1% in the 2020 second quarter. Operating income increased 29.1% to $526 million, up from $407.3 million in the second quarter of 2020. Net income increased to 29.7% and to $403.8 million compared to $311.4 million in the 2020 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2021 second quarter increased to 28.6% to $0.75 from $0.59 in the second quarter of 2020.

The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen for the month of June 2021 compared to June 2020, Monster’s retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 40.1% to 46.9% and in Brazil from 29.6% to 35.4%. In Chile, Monster’s retail market share decreased from 45.7% to 41.9%. Monster Energy continues to be the leading energy brand in value in Argentina. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country-to-country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending July 18, 2021, Monster’s retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 34.2% to 37.4% in Spain. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period to the end of June 2021, Monster’s retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 14.5% to 15.3% in Germany, from 18.4% to 19.4% in Poland and from 18.4% to 20.1% in South Africa.

Monster remains the market leader in Japan. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or four week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. Net sales to customers outside of the U.S. were $546.3 million, 37.4% of total net sales in the 2021 second quarter compared to $328.3 million or 30% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2020. Foreign currency exchange rates had a positive impact on net sales in the U.S. dollars by approximately $38.6 million in the 2021 second quarter. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company’s military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA, net sales in the 2021 second quarter increased to 105.7% in dollars and increased 86.5% in local currencies over the same period in 2020. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the second quarter was 39.8% compared to 38.1% in the same quarter in 2020, primarily due to a favorable country and product mix. We’re also pleased that in the 2021 second quarter, Monster gained market share in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, the Republic of Ireland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden. In Asia Pacific, net sales in the 2021 second quarter increased 5.2% in dollars and decreased 0.1 of a percent in local currencies over the same period in 2020, largely due to sales in Japan and China. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 44.4% versus 43.3% over the same period in 2020. In Japan, net sales in the 2021 second quarter decreased 15.1% in dollars and 13.9% in local currency, largely due to COVID-19 restrictions in Japan and distributor inventory adjustments. Depletions increased 7% during the quarter. Monster remains the market leader in Japan for the month of June 2021. In South Korea, net sales increased 63% in dollars and 50.4% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2020. In China, net sales decreased to 21.4% in dollars and 27.8% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2020. In this regard, we note that sales in the second quarter of 2020 included the initial launch of Dragon Tea. We are reevaluating the viability of this SKU and the optimal product range for China going forward. We remain optimistic about the prospects for the Monster brand in China. In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased to 146.5% in dollars and 98.2% in local currencies. Sales of the Monster brand in Oceana increased 210% in dollars and 155.6% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2020. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the 2021 second quarter increased to 119.7% in dollars and increased 117.6% in local currencies over the same period in 2020. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 40.7% compared to 41.2% over the same period in 2020, primarily as a result of foreign exchange rates and certain raw materials and ingredients for products in this region are purchased in U.S. dollars. In Brazil, net sales in the 2021 second quarter increased by 194.9% in dollars and 201.7% in local currency. Net sales in Chile increased 77.5% in dollars and 52% in local currency in the 2021 second quarter. Net sales in Argentina increased 291.4% in dollars and 458% in local currency in the 2021 second quarter. In March 2019, VPX, the maker of Bang Energy drinks, sued Monster, alleging that its Reign products infringed VPX’s Bang trademarks and trade risk. A trial was held last year. And on August 3, 2021, the court issued an order denying all of VPX’s claims and holding that VPX is entitled to no relief whatsoever. In fact, the court specifically found that VPX copied its bank trade risk from the original Monster Energy cans. The court’s decision confirms that Monster and Poland retail partners are free to continue to sell our Reign products without any changes and without any restrictions. Monster always believed and maintained that VPX’s claims were frivolous, and we are extremely pleased that the court rejected all of VPX’s claims while vindicating Monster’s rights. As other pending proceedings with VPX are subjudicate, we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today’s call. Our new product introductions in the United States in the first half of 2021 were primarily focused in the first quarter. In the United States, during the second quarter of 2021, we refreshed our can graphics on our Rehab Monster brand family as well as our Full Throttle line, also updating the name for Blue Agave to TrueBlue. Monster Energy Ultra Fiesta received a refresh and updated can graphics as well as the name change to Monster Energy Ultra Fiesta Manga. In May 2021, we launched Monster Ultra Fiesta in a 24-ounce option with an update to our Ultra Fiesta Manga plan for later this year. We are in the process of launching a new line of non-alcoholic pure energy sales under the True North brand name in 12-ounce sleek cans, which contained an organic plant-based energy blend and ingredients for immunity support. True North is being offered in six flavors, Cucumber Lime, Black Cherry, Grapefruit Lemonade, Water Mellon Mist, White Peach Pear and Mandarin Yuzu. True North has a limited customer target in 2021 with plans for a full launch into mainstream channels in 2022. While cognizant of the can shortages, we believe that it is important to continue with our innovation plans. And to this end, we will be launching our new flavors reserve line of Monster Energy drinks in Water Mellon and White Pineapple in October 2021. We have deferred the launch of our new line of Java Monster Cold Brew Coffee+ energy drinks until early 2022. In Canada, during the second quarter, we launched two new products: Monster Punch Papillon and Monster Punch Khaotic, both in a 473 ml can. In April 2021, we launched Reign Orange Dreamsicle in Puerto Rico and our second SKU in Bolivia with Monster Energy Zero Ultra. In El Salvador, we launched Fury Mean Green in May 2021. In the second quarter of 2021, we launched Juice Monster Pacific Punch and Monarch in a number of countries in EMEA. We also launched Ultra Paradise and Ultra Fiesta in a number of countries during the quarter. During the quarter, we also launched our strategic brand innovation and Predator in additional countries. In January 2021, we launched Ultra Rosa market-wide in Australia, following an exclusive lead launch with one chain in the fourth quarter of 2020. In March 2021 in New Zealand, we launched Monster Superfuel in both Purple Passion and sugar-free flavors. During the 2021 second quarter in Japan, we launched Monster Energy Super Cola with our distributor, Asahi Soft Drinks. Additionally, we effected the relaunch at retail of Ultra Paradise and began shipments in anticipation of the launch of Super Fuel early in the 2021 third quarter. Super Fuel has just gone on the shelves in Japan this week. We also launched Mango Loco in Korea in July 2021. During the 2021 second quarter, we launched Pipeline Punch in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. We also began distribution of Monster Energy Zero Sugar in the Philippines. As previously mentioned, in the second quarter of 2021, in China, we extended the national rollout of our new Monster Dragon Gold, which is non-carbonated. Our national summer on-pack promotion began in May with one of China’s top consumer ambassadors. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of our planned launches and innovation of new products in a number of Asia-Pacific markets have been deferred for a few months. However, we still anticipate such launches taking place toward the end of the 2021 calendar year. We are planning to launch a number of additional products and product lines in our domestic and international markets later this year. We estimate that July 2021 sales to be approximately 1.8% higher than in July 2020. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, July 2021 sales would have been comparable to the July 2020 sales. July 2021 had one less selling day than July 2020, which was 15.8% above July 2019, and which was 17.1% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis. Certain production facilities, mainly from the Coke bottlers in EMEA, in particular, delayed production from July to August 2021. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, the company has not been able to fully satisfy demand in the United States and EMEA due to a shortage of aluminum cans, which adversely impacted July sales. Such shortage was exacerbated in July as can availability did not keep pace with increased demand during the summer months. Additional cans have been sourced from domestic and overseas suppliers with expected deliveries increasing sequentially during the latter half of the year. We are working to replenish system inventories in order to meet customer demand as soon as possible. Additionally, the company also experienced delays in certain ingredients, which impacted supply. Our depletions remain solid as do our measured market data, as previously mentioned on this call. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays for, timing of new product launches, and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue in certain regions, our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Currently, the company’s flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses, and shipment facilities, and bottlers and distributors are all operating. We are continually addressing our aluminum can requirements, given our volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. We are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio and are planning additional launches later in the year. We are planning to continue additional launches of our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in additional international countries. We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury and our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy drinks in a number of international countries during the year. I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Dara Mohsenian: Hey, guys.
Rodney Sacks: Hey, Dara.
Dara Mohsenian: Great top line growth in the quarter, but we have seen share losses in U.S. track channel data worsened recently. A, just short-term, how much of that do you think is attributable to out of stocks and the supply constraints that you mentioned? Is that a material factor in retail sales? And then maybe, B, from a longer-term standpoint, it has been a couple of quarters now where the share losses have reaccelerated year-over-year, just some progress in the beginning of the year. So, I was just hoping you could review some of the key factors that have been driving the share losses in the U.S.? And how you think about those factors going forward in terms of continuing or dissipating and how you guys are positioned? Thanks.
Rodney Sacks: Hilton, if you take that, and I’ll also say something once you’ve…
Hilton Schlosberg: All right. I think, Dara, what’s important is that, that’s not a result and not due to us not growing. We are not keeping up with our share, but our business is certainly growing. And you can track that from Nielsen. You can also track that from the non-measured channels, which are growing really very nicely. So while we’re not keeping up necessarily with Red Bull in the major channels. As I’ve spoken on previous calls, Red Bull had a very large on-premise business, which has moved to off-premise and moved to off-premise during COVID. And that led to an acceleration in their share. However, we mentioned that we had and are continuing to sustain can issues and result in supply. And of course, that’s having an impact on the share numbers that you are seeing. So I think on balance, the business is growing. You’ve seen the results. It’s continuing to grow. And we are growing, but not at the extent of the market. I think with the full deck of cards, the situation may well be very different. But right now, we really are struggling with sufficient supplies of aluminum cans really to keep up with demand, which is, I suppose, a good position to be in. And on the other hand, is not such a good position to be in. The business is growing. And, that’s the message I want to leave you with and other investors.
Rodney Sacks: I think in – I’ll just add two short points in that regard. I think what we’ve tried to do is to try and also basically focus on our faster selling and our larger SKUs, which has necessarily resulted in some of the smaller SKUs, which normally have their own traction and followers. So those haven’t got on to shelf. And then the one additional thing that I think that has negatively affected our distribution sales and distribution levels in the U.S. is labor shortages. And I think that what we’ve seen is that many of the bottlers, Coke bottlers are experiencing labor shortages. And while one would ordinarily say, well, everybody is going to have the same problem. I think that where you have Red Bull is our main competitor, they have a dedicated system. I think they’ve been able to address their labor shortages just more effectively than the larger bottlers with large labor pools. And that has also, I think, detrimentally affected our distribution levels going forward. But again, I think those are things that once things start settling down and things will get back to normality, that’s something that I think that will also, in due course, right itself.
Hilton Schlosberg: Yes, I think we should also – Dara, I think we should also add that what we’re seeing with cans is something that will persist through this year. I’m a bit more optimistic about the fourth quarter because we have two new can suppliers coming on board. But the situation will persist. And then make sure, we should be in – we believe we’ll be in very good shape. But again, it all depends on consumer demand, which is growing, and you’ve seen that month-by-month and quarter-by-quarter.
Operator: And the next question today will come from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Bonnie Herzog: Thank you. Hi, everyone. I just wanted to ask about your gross margins. Clearly, they continue to be pressured as broadly expected, which you guys have been discussing with us. But just want to get your outlook for these pressures in the back half of the year? Hilton, you just mentioned that you’re optimistic. So just wanted to verify that you still expect some of these pressures to ease by Q4? Or do you think it’s going to take a little bit longer, especially in light of the recent spike in aluminum prices. So trying to understand how that factors in? And then just a clarification on the can shortages that you mentioned that you’re still experiencing, I guess, it sounds like it’s getting worse, but I really did want to clarify that. And is there any way that you guys could quantify how big of an impact the supply shortages had on your top-line either in the quarter or in July? Just trying to understand how much you think your shipments would have been up in July without these shortages, for instance? Thanks.
Hilton Schlosberg: Okay. So let me deal with the first issue first, if I may. I spoke about optimistic about can supplies. I really didn’t talk about margins. You’ll recall on the last call, I spoke about the issues that we were confronting with margin pressures like most other beverage companies. And where we are right now with aluminum, I mean, nobody knows. So you can talk to the leading banks in the field, which we do on a regular basis, and they really are pulls apart about their projections for aluminum in 2022, let alone 2021. So the last couple of days, you’ve seen a spike in the Midwest premium from this tax that is expected to be imposed on Russian aluminum. And as you know, the Midwest premium is strongly factors the last ton of aluminum to enter the U.S. and the cost of that. And so we’ve seen a spike in the Midwest premium. And we continue to see spikes in aluminum. So from that score, I think we just are in uncharted territory. I’ve been in this business for a long time, as you know, and I’ve never seen aluminum where it’s at right now. And I’ve never seen the Midwest premium at these kind of levels. So aluminum, I really cannot talk about. And also when you look at our business and you look at the factors that really have affected gross margin, number one, the fact that we’re selling a lot more internationally. So I talked earlier about 37.4% of our sales in the quarter outside of the U.S. 30% last year, that obviously impacts margins. We are importing cans from a number of countries that obviously impacts margins. In fact, the China and India cans that we are using in the United States and in EMEA will only be filed in August and July, and they will be filled this month, so that in itself, the imputation will impact gross margins. And then to cap everything else, we have ingredient issues. We had ingredient issues, as we mentioned, in July, which again reduced the amount that we would actually sell because we didn’t have sufficient ingredients to meet themselves, particularly with NOS. And so there are a number of factors that are increasing our cost of goods. And last quarter, I said I didn’t think that margins would get better in the second and third quarters. I read they will not – I think margins will deteriorate in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we’re getting some relief in terms of supplies from the U.S. on cans that are – have been contracted for and they were contracted for two years ago. And we saw the opportunity to work with two major suppliers to get additional cans produced in the U.S., and that’s why we have two new supplies opening, and we are an important and an anchor customer of both those facilities. But even that, you’re still dependent on aluminum. We have some hedges in place, but obviously not enough to take into consideration the amount of sales and the amount of consumer demand that is out there. So that’s a long-winded way of saying, I think, answering your question and as best as I can. And then just getting to your second question, because you’re really only allowed one, but to get to your second question, we have quantified or try to quantify the impact on can shortages in July and in this quarter and in the – potentially in the third quarter, but I really don’t want to – I’m not comfortable with those numbers yet. A lot of detailed work is being done on them. And I just – I can’t in good contents give those numbers because we still are in the throes of kind of finalizing what we think is probably correct. Rodney mentioned in his script earlier that a number of the bottlers, he mentioned particularly in EMEA, but there were cases in the U.S. as well, and there was a substantial case in the U.S. where the bottlers were obviously focused on other things in the quarter and were producing Coca-Cola brands. And as a result, I think we – our production got moved from July to August, so when I look at July, it doesn’t – I don’t get overly concerned because I know the sales are going into August.
Rodney Sacks: Perhaps, if I just on the shortage level, just to add that when we buy cans in contracted for our annual amount, they usually are sort of reasonably flat line across the year. And we used the first half of the year to build up can inventories and finished product inventories with ourselves and our bottlers. Earlier this year, obviously, demand sort of was strong, and so we really didn’t have that opportunity. So what has happened is that in June and July, which is your normal peak months, the demand has been higher, but our supply has been more level until we can get more can inventories into the market. So what happened is just that we have had a sort of a heartened increased shortage in the last month and July and probably will be a little bit in August. And then obviously, as we start increasing our – the cans we’re getting in, and then we’re able to balance it more and our demand balances more, we’ll start to have less of a different delta between these demand and supplier and eventually be able to – we’re hoping to able to build up our inventories and supply back to normal by the end of the fourth quarter or during or by the end of the fourth quarter.
Hilton Schlosberg: Yes. No one’s comfortable with the level of finished goods inventories that we’re running at, but it’s a sign of the times. I mean, we’re doing everything we can to supply our customers. And that’s why we spoke about freights. Freight is a big issue, not only getting raw material ingredients into co-packing system and into our bottling system and – but also distributing from our co-packers. And obviously, the one goes into cost of sales and freight out goes into operating expenses. So that’s why you’ll see freight really hitting both of those line items.
Operator: The next question will come from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Andrea Teixeira: Hi. Thank you. Hi. Good afternoon.
Rodney Sacks: Hi.
Hilton Schlosberg: Hi, Andrea.
Andrea Teixeira: How are you Hilton? Hi.
Hilton Schlosberg: I’m good.
Andrea Teixeira: Yes. Just on the gross margin, because your gross margin comments were very helpful and given this deterioration obviously that its probably here to stay in the next few quarters. How are you thinking about pricing? Obviously, you can’t supply the service levels that are used to with the retailers. So is that is something that takes – obviously, you have to take into account? Or perhaps as you get more informed on how the aluminum cost will evolve, you may contemplate it again?
Hilton Schlosberg: Yes. With regard to pricing, we continue to evaluate pricing, honestly, on a very, very regular basis, if not weekly. So we continue to evaluate it, and we want to make a good decision. Last time around, as I mentioned on previous calls, we went out alone, and we would like to have been in a situation this time where we followed our competitor, but we have to evaluate, obviously, the business as we see it and the impact for us. What we’ve done is we’re reducing our promotional allowances. So we’re taking a price increase the other way, through reducing promotional allowances, but the impact of that reduction in the second quarter was not as we would have liked. So we are – we really put the accelerator down and are more aggressive in reducing our promotional allowances. But we are continuing to evaluate the pricing and price increases. And then I have to leave this call with my favorite saying, and that is, we don’t bank gross profit margins, we bank gross profit dollars. And to me, the fact that we’re doing everything we can to satisfy our customers as best as we can is impacting gross profit margins. But at the end of the day, we don’t want to lose gross profit dollars, which is really important to ensure the sustainability of the brand and that’s the most important thing for us right now.
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you. That’s fair. Thank you, both.
Rodney Sacks: Yes. Basically, just make it clear, at this point, we are watching and we’re not planning a price increase. So we’re not adverse to a price, but we’ll wait and see what the market does and what our competitors do.
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you, Rodney.
Operator: This will conclude today’s question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.
Rodney Sacks: Thanks very much. Thank you, everyone, for your continued interest and support of the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy to remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company, both domestically and abroad. And in particular, expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottler system internationally. We believe that we will be able to navigate through the challenges ahead as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and hope that this unfortunate situation will resolve itself in the near future. We believe that we are well-positioned in the energy drink category and will continue to be and are optimistic about our total portfolio of energy drink brands. We hope that you will stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. And you may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-05-07 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to the Monster Beverage Company’s First Quarter 2021 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rodney Sacks and Mr. Hilton Schlosberg, Co-CEOs. Please go ahead.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I am Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and my Co-Chief Executive Officer is on the call. As is Tom Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom Kelly will now read the cautionary announcement.
Tom Kelly: Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended and are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends as well as the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company’s business and operations. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2021, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and forward-looking statements for discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you, Tom. The company’s top priority remains the health, safety and well-being of its employees. The company’s flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities have operated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The company’s bottlers and distributors are operating and the company’s products remain generally available to consumers. In limited countries, the operations of the company’s bottlers or distributors have, in part be negatively affected for varying periods of time. Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company achieved record first quarter net sales. Currently, the company does not foresee a material impact on the ability of its co-packers to manufacture and its bottlers and distributors to distribute its products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company’s supply chain remains largely intact. However, the company is experiencing shortages in its aluminum can requirements in North America and Europe given the company’s volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. The company has taken steps to source quantities of aluminum cans from South America and Asia. However, logistical issues, including ocean freight and port of entry congestion, could delay such supply. Logistical issues in relation to the importation of certain other raw materials and ingredients could impact future supply. Furthermore, we are continuing to experience freight inefficiencies and like other beverage companies are incurring increased aluminum can and other costs in the current environment. In the first quarter of 2021, net sales were $1.24 billion compared to $1.06 billion in the first quarter of 2020, an increase of 17.1%. Adjusting for foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2021 first quarter would have been up 16.2%. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2021 first quarter was 57.5% and compared with 60% in this 2020 first quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 3 months ended March 31, 2021 was primarily the result of increased input costs mainly increased raw material freight-in costs, geographical sales mix and higher promotional allowances as a percentage of net sales. Operating expenses for the 2021 first quarter were $300.8 million compared with $272.2 million in the 2020 first quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2021 first quarter were 24.2% compared with 25.6% in the 2020 first quarter. Operating income increased 13.5% to $414.1 million, up from $365 million in the first quarter of 2020. Net income increased 13% to $315.2 million as compared to $278.8 million in the 2020 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2021 first quarter increased 14.2% to $0.59 from $0.52 in the first quarter of 2020. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through April 24, 2021 for all outlets combined namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 20.3% versus the same period a year ago.

According to Stackline, which tracks energy drink sales by Amazon in the United States for the 4-week period ending April 17, 2021, sales in dollars in the energy category by Amazon, including energy shots, increased 160.1% over the same period the previous year. Sales of Monster increased 163% and its share was 35.6%, up 0.4 of a share point versus the same period a year ago. Red Bull sales increased 135.4% and its share was 13.7%, down 1.4 points.

According to Nielsen, in all measured channels in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended March 27, 2021, the energy drink category increased 17.5% in dollars. Sales of the company’s energy drink brands increased 27.2% versus a year ago. The market share of the company’s energy drink brands was 42.1%, up 3.2 points.

Vive 100 sales increased 1.9% and its market share decreased by 3.3 points to 20.3%.

Predator, which was launched in March 2020, achieved a market share of 2.7%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that maybe undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen, for the month of March 2021 compared to March 2020, Monster’s retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 37.9% to 45.2% and in Brazil from 25.4% to 34.7%. In Chile, Monster’s retail market share decreased from 42.1% to 40%. Monster Energy continues to be the leading energy brand in value in Argentina. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended April 4, 2021, Monster’s retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 15.8% to 16% in Germany, from 19.7% to 28.1% in Italy, and from 17.3% to 20.6% in South Africa. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period till the end of March 2021, Monster’s retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 13.2% to 15.1% in Belgium; from 12.6% to 14.8% in the Czech Republic; from 24.5% to 26.4% in Denmark; from 28% to 31.8% in France; from 22.7% to 27.9% in Great Britain; from 34% to 37.7% in Greece; from 6.4% to 8% in the Netherlands; from 24.7% to 29.1% in Norway; from 15.3% to 18.2% in Poland; from 23.8% to 28% in the Republic of Ireland; and from 34% to 36% in Spain; and from 13.5% to 14.9% in Sweden. The Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to IRI in Australia, Monster’s market share in value for the 4 weeks ended April 11, 2021 increased from 10% to 13.1% as compared to the same period the previous year. Mother’s market share in value decreased from 13.6% to 11.8% during the same period. The market share of the company’s brands in Australia for the 4 weeks ended April 11, 2021 increased from 23.6% to 24.9%. According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster’s market share in value for the 4 weeks ended April 18, 2021 increased from 9.9% to 12.7% as compared to the same period the previous year. Live+’s market share in value decreased from 7.4% to 6.5% and Mother’s market share in value decreased from 6.5% to 5.6%. The market share of the company’s brands in New Zealand for the 4 weeks ended April 18, 2021 increased from 23.9% to 24.8%. According to Nielsen, in South Korea, Monster’s market share in value in all outlets combined for the month of March 2021 increased from 52.3% to 54.8% as compared to the same period in the previous year. According to INTAGE in Japan, Monster’s market share in value in the convenience store channel for the month of March 2021 decreased from 62.1% to 50.1% as compared to the same period in the previous year. Monster remains the market leader in Japan. However, our share was negatively impacted by the labeling issue of a product referenced in our fourth quarter 2020 release, which was re-listed on retail shelves in April 2021 by the introduction of new SKUs by new competitor and by the timing of our 2021 innovation. We again pointed out that certain market statistics that cover single months or 4-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. was $459.4 million, a 36.9% of total net sales in the 2021 first quarter compared with $356.8 million and 33.6% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2020. Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of increasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $9.3 million in the 2021 first quarter. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company’s military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA, net sales in the 2021 first quarter increased 27.7% in dollars and increased 21.2% in local currencies over the same period in 2020. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales in the first quarter was 37.3% compared to 43.1% in the same quarter in 2020 primarily...
Tom Kelly: 41.3%, sorry.
Rodney Sacks: 41.3% primarily due to unfavorable country and product mix. We are also pleased that in the 2021 first quarter, Monster gained market share in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, the Republic of Ireland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden. In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the 2021 first quarter increased 24.8% in dollars and 17.4% in local currencies over the same period in 2020. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales, was 48.8% versus 42% over the same period in 2020. In Japan, net sales in the 2021 first quarter increased 9.2% in dollars and 4.1% in local currency. In South Korea, net sales increased 17% in dollars and 9.6% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2020. In China, net sales increased 59.4% in dollars in the 2021 first quarter and 48% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2020. In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 66% in dollars and 47.8% in local currencies. Sales of the Monster brand in Oceana increased 65.6% in dollars and 48.1% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2020. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the 2021 first quarter increased 35.7% in dollars and increased 55.9% in local currencies over the same period in 2020. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 37.9% compared to 42.5% over the same period in 2020 primarily as a result of foreign exchange rates as certain raw materials and ingredients for products in this region are purchased in U.S. dollars. In Brazil, net sales in the 2021 first quarter increased by 34% in dollars and 70.1% in local currency. Net sales in Chile increased 48.9% in dollars and 37.7% in local currency in the 2021 first quarter. Since our last earnings call in February 2021, there have been no significant updates on our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals Inc., the maker of Bang energy drinks. As this litigation and other pending proceedings with VPX are subjugate, we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today’s call. In the United States, during early January 2021, we converted our 10-pack Monster portfolio into 12 packs. In late January 2021, we launched Reign Cherry Limeade and Reign White Gummy Bear as well as Reign Inferno Watermelon warlord. We also launched Monster Ultra Gold in singles and in a 4-pack. In late February 2021, we launched four core flavors: Monster Green, Low-Carb Monster, Monster Zero Ultra and Monster Ultra Paradise in 12-ounce slim cans targeted to the convenience retail channel and food service channel. In late March 2021, we converted our entire Monster Hydro portfolio into 20-ounce PET containers and added 2 new Monster Hydro Super Sport SKUs, Kilo Kiwi and Macho Mango. In late March 2021, we also launched Rehab Monster Strawberry Lemonade as the first non-tea option in the Rehab Monster brand family. We refreshed 2 SKUs during the first quarter of 2021, Monster Max Super Dry into Monster Nitro Super Dry in a 16-ounce can as well as a refreshed design on Monster result. This summer, we are also planning to launch a new line of energy drinks under the True North brand name in 12-ounce sleek cans, which will contain an organic plant-based energy blend and ingredients for immunity support. Initially, True North will have a limited target in 2021, with plans for a full launch into mainstream channels in 2022. We are planning to launch additional new products later in 2021. In Canada, during early January 2021, we launched Monster Ultra Fiesta, Java Monster Oat Milk as well as Monster Ultra Paradise 4-pack. Later in February 2021, we launched Monster Ultra Paradise in singles as a 310 ml option. In early March 2021, we launched Reign Lilikoi Lychee singles and Reign Orange Dreamsicle in singles and a 4-pack. We also launched NOS Turbo in March 2021. In February 2021, we launched Pacific Punch in Mexico and in Honduras we launched Mean Green, our second flavor of Fury, which is one of our affordable energy brands. In March 2021, we launched Ultra Watermelon in Puerto Rico and Ultra Paradise in Aruba. We introduced a number of SKUs across EMEA in the 2021 first quarter. Highlights include the geographical expansion of a number of existing Monster Reign and strategic brand products into new countries, including Juice Monster Pacific Punch, Juice Monster Monarch, which is Papillon in non-EMEA markets, Juice Monster Mango Loco, Juice Monster Pipeline Punch, Monster Ultra Paradise, Monster Ultra Fiesta, Monster Zero Ultra, Monster Ultra Blue, Black Monster Ultra Sunrise in Russia, Monster Mule, Burn Zero Peach and Play Zero Peach. Various Reign SKUs, including Reign Melon Mania, Sour Apple, Razzleberry, Peach Fuzz, Orange Dreamsicle and Lemonades were launched in Belgium; the Netherlands, South Africa, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden and Germany in the first quarter of 2021. In January 2021, we launched Ultra Rosa market-wide in Australia, following an exclusive lead launch with one chain in the fourth quarter of 2020. In March 2021 in New Zealand, we launched Monster Super Fuel in both Purple Passion and sugar-free flavors. During the 2021 first quarter in Japan, we launched Monster Energy Super Cola with our distributor, Asahi Soft Drinks. Additionally, we began shipments in the quarter in Japan for the re-launch at retail of Ultra Paradise in April 2021. During the 2021 first quarter, we launched Pipeline Punch in Hong Kong and Macau and began distribution of Monster Energy Zero Sugar in the Philippines. We are planning to launch a number of additional products and/or market lines in our domestic and international markets later this year. During the 2021 first quarter, no shares were repurchased under the previously authorized repurchase program. As of May 6, 2021, approximately $441.5 million remained available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase program. We estimate April 2021 sales to be approximately 71.3% higher than in April 2020. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis, April 2021 sales would have been approximately 67.8% higher than comparable April 2020 sales. April 2021 had the same number of selling days as April 2020. Please keep in mind that the comparative April 2020 sales were materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In our 2020 first quarter conference call to shareholders, we reported that April 2020 sales were 22.2% lower than our April 2019 sales, with the same number of selling days in both periods. In this regard, we are caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches, the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue in certain regions, our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. One, currently, the company’s flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities and bottlers and distributors are all operating. We are continually addressing our aluminum can requirements given our volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. We are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio and are planning additional launches later in the year. Three, we are planning to continue additional launches of our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in additional international countries. Four, we are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury and our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in a number of international countries during the year. Five, finally, please note that similar to last year in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we will conduct our annual stockholders’ meeting exclusively as a viral meeting via live webcast. Additional information regarding attending the annual meeting, voting your shares and submitting questions can be found in the company’s proxy statement. I’d like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Bonnie Herzog: Hi, everyone.
Hilton Schlosberg: Hi, Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog: I wanted – hello. I wanted to ask you guys about the shortages of cans you’re experiencing. Could you give us a sense of how big of a driver that was of your gross margin contraction in the quarter? I mean was it the bulk of that, for instance? And I’m curious to hear if the situation has deteriorated further in April and May? And then finally, when do you expect the shortage situation to improve or maybe stabilize? I mean, I guess, trying to understand if we all should assume this will be a pretty big issue for the remainder of the year? Thanks.
Rodney Sacks: Okay. So maybe I can get that, Bonnie. So what happened when we set our can requirements with our can companies about a year ago, we estimated that our sales would be 10% to 12% or up this year. In fact, as you can see, they are substantially above that. So whatever we contracted for, we’ve got. What happened with our sales in January and February, ourselves were doing okay. And then in March, they have spiked up. And as Rodney quoted, in April, they are spiked up yet again. So what we’ve done is we’ve procured additional cans from South America and from Asia that will start coming in late in the second quarter. We also have new can companies that are opening their doors later this year, and we will be drawing cans from those companies as well. So to answer your question about the first quarter, yes, there was an impact. And the big impact, as we mentioned, in the release and on this call is that the bigger impact was these freight in costs where we were drawing product, for example, from Canada, and we were shipping product from various locations to our distribution center that impacted cost of sales. We also had – we broke our orbits. In other words, we’ve always tried to manufacture and sell within regions to avoid excessive shipping costs. We had to break that this year to satisfy consumer demand and so that was another factor that impinged on the results. But the margin was impacted by – not only by those freight costs, but – excuse me, as we mentioned by the promotional allowances that were higher in the second quarter across the board. And also, from our geographical sales mix, because as you know, we sold a significantly higher percentage of product overseas than we did in the U.S. So it’s the same story that we’ve experienced and we’ve spoken to shareholders, the more we sell overseas, the lower is our gross margin percentage. But again, I must caution shareholders that we bank dollars, we don’t bank gross profit percentages. And in taking the decisions we took in the first quarter, it was important to do so to satisfy demand. We knew the profitability would be higher, but the percentage may, in fact, be lower, which it was.
Operator: The next question is from Laurent Grandet of Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
Laurent Grandet: Yes. Good evening everyone. And actually, I want to dig a bit more in what you’re just saying in terms of gross margin. So you mentioned freight, so I understand that’s the number one. The aluminum cans, you mentioned also, I mean, promotional activity. So if we were to put some numbers, it’s freight, 50% of the impact. I mean aluminum can and now maybe 30% and promotional activity, 20%. I’d like to basically understand this a bit better. If you can, give us an idea here, that would be great? Thank you.
Hilton Schlosberg: So Laurent, we spoke about the first quarter. In the first quarter, the impact of the aluminum can costs were not a major factor. And as you know, and everyone else on the call probably knows as well that we have suffered significant and will set a significant increases in aluminum costs going forward. So for example, it’s no secret, but if you look back on a year ago, aluminum costs are up 83.6%, including the Midwest premium in the U.S., and they are up 71%, 71.1% in Europe. So as we go forward, we may not have some of the cost impacts on gross margin, but we certainly will have impacts on aluminum in the second and subsequent quarters. So for me to talk more about the first quarter, we don’t actually give the numbers out that you’re asking for. But what I can say is that I don’t expect the margins to improve going forward this year. I expect that we will not – that our margins will not improve as we go into the second, third. Possibly the fourth quarter, I think things will be better. That’s my analysis. But certainly in the second and third quarter, we will continue to suffer gross margin percentage in our stress gross margin percentage erosion.
Operator: The next question is from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Chris Carey: Hi everyone. 
Hilton Schlosberg: Hi, Chris.
Chris Carey: So obviously, a big – hey, so obviously, a big number quarter to-date. And I guess the question is, with the aluminum supply shortages that you have, are you going to run into some issues with the ability to fill that demand? And could that prevent you from doing some things that might help with your gross margin, which sounds like they could improve by Q4, like taking any pricing in the business?
Hilton Schlosberg: So that’s obviously something that we’re very aware about on pricing. I know what some of our competitors, some of the big beverage companies have spoken about with regard to pricing. But I’m not sure that we would take – move ourselves. Last time we went ahead and did it irrespective of Red Bull’s strategy with regard to pricing. They – I think this time around, we’re examining what they will be doing. Remember, they are importing a substantial amount of their cans and product from overseas. So we will be watching that. But there are other ways to take price up, for example, we can reassess, which we are doing, structure of promotional allowances to move margins in a more positive direction. But again, we don’t want to disturb the business that is doing very well. Our share is – we’re happy with where the business is going. We’re happy with our share, and we know when to disturb what we already have. So we bring in cans from abroad, as I said, we’re getting new cans in the system later on in the year. And as far as we’re concerned, we will continue to examine the opportunity to take price. And if necessary, as I’ve said, we’re looking at on our promotional allowances as well.
Operator: The next question is from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Andrea Teixeira: Hi, thank you, and good afternoon. On the True North Organic Energy launch, should we assume that the impact will be mostly concentrated in the second half, and particularly in 2022? And does that mean you have decided to remain in non-alcohol segment and you’re not launching a hard seltzer for now? And then hit on the gross margin, and I appreciate your commentary maybe perhaps we should assume that it may get worse before it gets better, given the freight and aluminum have actually been sequentially worse? Thank you.
Rodney Sacks: Perhaps I’ll take the part of it, and Hilton can take part of it. On True North, we are, as I indicated, we are going to have limited sales just going into and seeding the market this year. The full launch and rollout will take place early in – from the beginning or early in 2022. So it will – we think it will have an impact in 2022, and we will have much less of an impact this year.
Hilton Schlosberg: Okay. Andrea, you were talking about margins. As I said, I don’t think margins will get better in the second and the third quarter, margin percentages, but with robust sales which is obviously something that we’re looking at in terms of our own forecasting, although we don’t give guidance, we must look at the bottom line, and we must not necessarily look at percentages. Because what we have to do as part of our everyday function is to satisfy the demand of our customers because the last thing we want to do is to have our bottlers on the line without inventory, our consumers gravitating to other products. And we have to maintain the status quo. The company is doing really well on the top line. And we, hopefully, will continue to do so.
Rodney Sacks: Yes. Just – and then just to complete your question with regard to the alcoholic CELSIUS side. I don’t think you can assume that we are going into it or not going into it. Don’t make that assumption. We’ve addressed the nonalcoholic sell some market. We’ve decided a strategy, and we’ve developed products. And align, and we are going to launch that line. As regards to alcoholic sensing, we are still looking at the market. I think if you have been watching the market, I’m sure the analysts have been. I think you’ve seen quite a lot of – a fortune of new products being launched, many – in cases from the same companies, just different variants. Throwing them against the wall and seeing what’s going to stick. What you’ve also seen in the last 3 months, what we’ve noticed is quite a falloff in the rate of increase in the category. And as the category is maturing, so the increase is also tempering. So we are involved in looking at that category in developing products and as I think I’ve said in the last call, we simply don’t want to launch a product. That’s me-too and that follows everyone else. It’s just no point in that and taking the time and effort and detracting from our focus on our core energy brands and portfolio, where we get a better return and have, obviously, it’s much easier for us to get meaningful sales. But we are continuing to monitor the alcoholic energy seltzer category. And we may well do something in that. But how we do it and what we do it is still not being determined and still not – we don’t have a firm direction. So, all I can really say is just that we are addressing it, but we shouldn’t assume that we are definitely going to go ahead or definitely not going to go ahead or how.
Operator: The next question is from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Mark Astrachan: Yes. Hey, thanks, and good afternoon everyone. I guess, don’t kill me I am going to ask a bunch of it for follow-up questions here so helping restrain yourself for a second.
Hilton Schlosberg: Sure. 
Mark Astrachan: I guess on – are can shortages impacting your U.S. market share, if not, or if they are, could you maybe just talk about kind of what you’re seeing in the U.S. also, could you clarify on the gross margin you’re talking about relative to 1Q levels for 2Q and 3Q? Or are you talking about – you’re not giving us any sort of color on 2Q and 3Q relative to 1Q? And then back to the other question on pricing and then related to promotional allowances. So your capacity constrained, at least for the time being, what’s the harm in taking price to constrain the demand and then also, you’re suggesting then the promotional allowances after 1Q will lessen in 2Q, 3Q kind of for the same effect?
Hilton Schlosberg: Okay. So where do you want me to start? So I think it is fair to say that out of stocks have impacted share. I don’t know how big that impact is. And I’m not going to because honestly, we don’t know. But what we do know is that Red Bulls on-premise has moved into the measured channels. There is no question about that. I think we underestimated the impact of their on-premise business moving into major channels. However, our share is doing nicely. Our sales are growing very nicely. And frankly, we are selling everything that we can make. And what you guys are not seeing or not addressing is things like Amazon. We spoke about the Stackline data and our other unmeasured channels, for example, the Home Depots and the Lowe’s and the home improvement stores and all those other parts of the business that are very strong for us are continuing to grow and continue to gain share in those particular channels. So overall, I think we are satisfied with where we are, as I said earlier. And we’re anticipating that as soon as we they can start coming to the U.S., and we start being in a more orderly situation that we will continue to grow again as we anticipate. So that was one question. Your second question was on margins. And I think I said that I expect my personal view, and this is not guidance, but I expect margins to get worse in the second and third quarter before they get better. So that’s my answer to that. Mark, just remind me, what are your other questions?
Mark Astrachan: Pricing and promotional allowances relative to capacity constraints.
Hilton Schlosberg: Okay. I think pricing, I said to you, we’re continuing to evaluate. And we’re doing this on a honestly, on a daily basis. We would like Red Bull to lead, but if they don’t lead, we will make a decision as to where we should or shouldn’t go with regard to pricing. With regard to promotional allowances, that is correct. We will – we are putting back promotional allowances, and you should see – we should see some impact in future quarters.
Operator: Next question is from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Dara Mohsenian: Hey, guys. So just one quick clarity question and then one broader question, just – it does sound like there is a little bit of demand impact from the lack of full supply on the aluminum side. Are you expecting that to be a significant issue in Q2 before it gets better and you get some of this incremental supply in, just trying to understand that in the short-term? And then just a broader question, we’ve obviously seen an acceleration in U.S. energy category growth the last few quarters after the initial weakness for a few months post-COVID. Can you just review what you think the key factors have been behind that acceleration in U.S. category growth? How sustainable they are going forward as we sort of look to that cycling that higher category growth in the back half of the year? Thanks.
Hilton Schlosberg: So maybe I’ll just take the first one, and then we will get Rodney to take the second one. So Dara, if you look at April sales, for example, and you take out – you strip out what happened in 2020. And you can see that there was a very big impact in sales in the second quarter and a very positive impact. So it is presenting challenges to the supply chain team, and we are doing everything we can to ensure that we’re able to keep as much as possible in stock. In fact, we’re focusing on the SKUs that are generating the significant part of our volumes at the expense of SKUs that are not performing as well. So that’s really where we’re at with regard to the second quarter. We will be getting cans in. If these port issues resolve themselves, and we will – we’re trying as best as we can to get back in stock as soon as possible.
A - Rodney Sacks: Yes. Just to – just add – just one thing. The uncertainty that we’ve got is, obviously, for cans that we’re importing, we are also incurring freight costs above the aluminum cost or can price. So that’s why those costs will go up the shorter term. As the additional plants in the U.S. come on stream, we will get back to a more normalized pricing structure for cans and get the additional volume. So it’s a little difficult now to predict exactly where we’re going to go on a month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter basis, but we think it will normalize, as Hilton said, towards the fourth quarter. With regard to the increased category, I think we’re already in a world of just unknowns. The category had a really steep hit rewards in late March, early April last year. Different in different parts of the world, when a lot of the bottlers literally took their staff and people teams out of the markets. But it has come back and the growth has come back really, really nicely. And so one of the things that we were – which were sort of unusual, we found that the growth was generally, historically has always been led by the convenience channel at a higher rate than the mainstream grocery and drug channels. And that sort of reversed itself with COVID. So again, you’re looking at factors that are just not normal. What we have seen, as you can see from the last 4 weeks numbers, we quoted in Nielsen from convenience, that started to pick up again quite nicely. So again, we’re in a very uncertain period because of what happened last year and your comps on last year. But even if you look at the 2-year stack sort of set of numbers, you’re getting some healthy growth back, where the category had slowed a little bit towards the end of ‘19, the growth was – they were still growing a bit slower. So we think that we will see continued growth regardless of how we come out of COVID and how our people come back into the markets. And we are hopeful for that. But again, it’s – we just can’t predict that at this stage. Our numbers are good. The numbers are strong. And Red Bull’s numbers have been strong again, a little bit, we think, skewed by the switch from on-premise to off-premise, but continue to grow. And obviously, we are the main players in the category. And so, the category growth is driven by our – respectively, by our two brands respective sales. So I think it all goes well for us, but we just don’t have any – I can’t give you any further color on it because we would be guessing, I think we all are.
Tom Kelly: Yes. So the only thing I would add to that is that I always look at the first quarter of 2020 because that was kind of a pure quarter for us. COVID started kind of late in the quarter, where our sales were already in-house. And so the first quarter for us was really 2020 was really kind of a normal quarter. And if you look back to that first quarter, and I always do. First quarter net sales in 2020 over 2019 rose 12.3%. So even as we entered into COVID, our sales were strong.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Sacks and Mr. Schlosberg for closing remarks.
Rodney Sacks: Thanks very much. On behalf of Monster, I’d like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy it’s remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad, and in particular, expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally. We believe that we will be able to navigate through the challenges ahead as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and hope that this unfortunate situation will resolve itself in the near future. We believe that we are well positioned in the energy drink category and continue to be optimistic about our total portfolio of energy drink brands. We hope that you will all stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-25 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Company Fourth Quarter 2020 Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Rodney Sacks and Mr. Hilton Schlosberg, Co-CEOs. Gentlemen, please proceed.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer is on the call, as is Tom Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will now read the cautionary announcement statement.
Thomas Kelly: Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends as well as the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company’s business and operations. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risk and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 28th, 2020 and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed on November 6th, 2020 including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and forward-looking statements for a discussion on specific risk and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you, Tom. The company's top priority continues to be the health, safety and well-being of its employees. Early in March 2020, the company implemented global travel restrictions and work-from-home policies for employees who are able to work remotely. For those employees who are unable to work remotely, safety precautions have been instituted, which were developed and adopted in line with guidance from public health authorities and professional consultants. Throughout this period, the company has engaged with its employees through ongoing communications, online training and personnel development opportunities to promote their well-being and motivation. The company's flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities are all operating. Certain of the company's bottlers and distributors have implemented modifications to their core points and service levels, but the company's products remain generally available to consumers. In limited countries, the operations of its bottlers and distributors have been more affected. Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company achieved record fourth quarter net sales. While our performance in EMEA was solid in the fourth quarter, EMEA remained adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since mid-March 2020, the company has seen a shift in consumer channel preferences and package configurations, including an increase in at-home consumption and a decrease in foodservice on-premise consumption.  The company's sales in the 2020 second quarter were initially adversely affected as a result of a decrease in foot traffic in the convenience and gas channel, which is the company's largest channel, but improved sequentially from the latter half of the 2020 second quarter and throughout the 2020, third and fourth quarters.  The company's sales in e-commerce, club store, mass merchandiser and grocery and related business continued to increase in the fourth quarter, while its foodservice on-premise business, which is a small channel for the company remained challenged.  Currently, the company does not foresee a material impact on the ability of its co-packers to manufacture and it’s bottlers and distributors to distribute it’s product as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the company is not experiencing significant raw material or finished product shortages, and its supply chain remains intact. Company is continually addressing the increase in it’s aluminum can requirements, given the companies volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. In the fourth quarter of 2020, net sales were $1.2 billion compared with $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusting for foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2020 fourth quarter would have been up 18.3%. Net sales for the 2020 fourth quarter were negatively impacted by $15.2 million related to product returns from our customers as a result of a European formulation issue with a limited number of products in Europe and a labeling issue concerning one product in Japan. We will refer to this on our call as product returns.  Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2020 fourth quarter was 57.7% compared with 60% in the 2019 fourth quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2020 fourth quarter was primarily the result of the impact of the product returns, associated inventory provisions and other related costs. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales excluding the impact of the product returns associated inventory provisions and other related costs was 59.3% for the 2020 fourth quarter.  To a lesser extent, the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was the result of increased input costs and unfavorable geographical mix during the 2020 fourth quarter, which were partially offset by favorable product mix.  Operating expenses for the 2020 fourth quarter were $288.4 million compared to $293.7 million in the 2019 fourth quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2020 fourth quarter were 24.1% compared to 28.9% in the 2019 fourth quarter, primarily Q2 decreased expenditures of $13.5 million for legal settlements and decreased expenditures for sponsorships and endorsements as well as travel and entertainment as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The cost for certain postponed or rescheduled events have been or may be deferred to future periods. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the company is unable to estimate in which future periods, if any, such deferred sponsorship and endorsement costs will be recognized. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by increased payroll expenses of $12.1 million, increased outbound freight and warehouse costs of $11.4 million and increased expenditures of $8.2 million for social media and digital marketing. Operating income increased 26.9% to $402.3 million, up from $317 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Operating income for the 2020 fourth quarter, excluding the impact of the product returns associated inventory provisions and other related costs increased 35.5% to $429.6 million from $317 million in the 2019 fourth quarter. Net income increased 85% to $471.7 million as compared to $255 million in the 2019 comparable quarter. Net income for the 2020 fourth quarter was positively impacted by a non-recurring tax benefit of approximately $165.1 million, due to an intra entity transfer of intangible assets between certain of the companies foreign subsidiaries, which resulted in a step-up of the tax deductible basis in the transferred assets in a foreign jurisdiction and created a temporary difference between the tax basis and the book basis of such intangible assets. Net income for the 2020 fourth quarter, excluding the non-recurring tax benefit, the impact of the product returns, associated inventory provisions and other related costs increased 28.9% to $328.6 million from $255 million in the 2019 fourth quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2020 fourth quarter increased 87.5% to $0.88 from $0.47 in the fourth quarter of 2019. Diluted earnings per share for the 2020 fourth quarter excluding the non-recurring tax benefit, the impact of the product returns associated inventory provisions and other related costs increased 30.6% to $0.62 from $0.47 in the fourth quarter of 2019. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through February 13, 2021, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 11.2% versus the same period a year ago.

According to Nielsen, in the four weeks ended February 13th, 2021, sales in dollars in the coffee + energy drink category, which includes our Java Monster line, in the convenience and gas channel increased 18.5% over the same period the previous year. Sales of Java Monster, including Java Monster 300 were 26.7% higher in the same period versus the previous year.  Sales of Starbucks Energy were 18.5% higher. Java Monster share, including Java Monster 300 of the coffee + energy category, which primarily includes Java Monster, Java Monster 300, Starbucks, Doubleshot and Tripleshot, Rockstar Roasted and Ban Keto Coffee for the four weeks ended February 13th, 2021, was 52.9%, up 3.4 points, while Starbucks Energy share remained at 44.6%.  According to Stackline, which tracks energy drink sales by Amazon, in the United States for the four-week period ending February 13th, 2021, sales in dollars in the energy category by Amazon, including energy shots increased 177.8% over the same period the previous year.  Sales of Monster increased 193.7%, and its share was 34.2%, up 1.8 share points versus the same period a year ago. Red Bull sales increased 171.8%, and its share was 14.7%, down 0.1 - sorry, 0.3 points. CELSIUS’ sales increased 224.8%, and its share increased 2.1 points to 14.5%. 5-hour sales increased 56.4% and it share declined 2.7 points to 3.5%. VPX Bang sales increased 272.5% and the share increased 1.2 share points to 4.9% Reign share increased 2.3 share points to 6.4%, and Rockstar share increased 0.2 of a share point to 3.5%.  According to Nielsen in all measured channels in Canada for the 12 weeks ended January 30th, 2021, the energy drink category increased 15.2% in dollars. Sales of the company's energy drink brands increased 24.9% versus a year ago.  The market share of the company's energy drink brands was 41.3%, up 3.2 points. Monster sales increased 18% and its market share increased 0.8 of a point to 35.7%. Monster sales increased 3.3%, and its market share decreased 0.2 of a point to 2%. Full Throttle sales decreased 6%. Its market share decreased 0.2 of a point to 1%. Red Bull sales increased 18.4% and its market share increased 1 point to 37.6%.

Predator, which was launched in March 2020 achieved a market share of 2.8%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO Convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO Convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brand, during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen for the month of December 2020 compared to December 2019, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 34% to 45.5%; in Brazil from 25.2% to 32.2%; and in Chile from 40.3% to 47.2%. Since the launch of Monster Energy in Argentina in the first quarter of 2018, Monster Energy is now the leading energy brand in value in both Argentina and Chile. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period to the end of January 2021, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 12.8% to 15.4% in Belgium; from 28.3% to 31.1% in France; from 22% to 27.3% in Great Britain; and from 6.1% to 7.9% in the Netherlands. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period to the end of December 2020, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 13.2% to 15.2% in the Czech Republic, from 22.9% to 26.3% in Denmark, from 34.7% to 37.7% increase, from 20.3% to 27.9% in Italy from 24.2% to 30.5% in Norway, from 14.3% to 21% in Poland, from 22.9% to 28.2% in the Republic of Ireland, from 18.1% to 21% in South Africa, from 35.5% to 37.3% in Spain, and from 12.7% to 14.4% in Sweden, and declined from 16.4% to 16% in Germany. Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to IRI in Australia, Monster's market share in value for the four weeks ending January 17, 2021, increased from 9.4% to 12.1% as compared to the same period the previous year. Mother's market share in value decreased from 13% to 12.2% during the same period. Market share of the company's brands in Australia for the four weeks ended January 17, 2021, increased from 22.4% to 24.2%. According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the four weeks ended January 3, 2021, increased from 9.7% to 10.8% as compared to the same period the previous year. Lift Plus market share in value decreased from 8.1% to 7%, and Mother's market share in value decreased from 6.2% to 6. 1%. Market share of the company's brands in New Zealand for the four weeks ended January 3, 2021, decreased from 24% to 23.9%. According to Nielsen in South Korea, Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined for the month of December 2020 grew from 52% to 56.5% as compared to the same period in the previous year. According to INTAGE in Japan, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel for the month of December 2020 decreased from 55.5% to 49.2% as compared to the same period in the previous year, primarily due to the impact of the product returns in Japan as well as initial trial sales following the launch of new products by two large competitors. Monster remains the market leader in Japan. We again point out that certain markets statistics cover single months or four week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. We are seeing some recent softness in the performance in the Energy category in the U.S., which we are reviewing. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $384.8 million, 32.2% of total net sales in the 2020 fourth quarter compared to $319.5 million or 31.4% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2019. Net sales to customers outside the United States for the 2020 fourth quarter were negatively impacted by $15.2 million related to the product returns. Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $7.1 million in the 2020 fourth quarter. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 25% in dollars and increased 22.8% in local currencies over the same period in 2019. Net sales adjusted for the product returns in this region, increased 30.5% in dollars and 27.4% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 30.2%, compared to 38.7% in the same quarter in 2019. Gross profit percentage for the region was negatively impacted by the product returns in this region, associated inventory provisions and other related costs, foreign exchange rates as well as geographic mix. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, excluding the impact of the product returns in this region, associated inventory provisions and other related costs was 40.1% for the 2020 fourth quarter, compared with 38.7% in the same quarter of 2019. In local currencies, gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 31.7%. We're also pleased that the fourth - in the fourth quarter Monster gained market share, in Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, the Republic of Ireland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden. In Asia Pacific, net sales in the fourth quarter decreased 2.1% in dollars and 5% in local currencies over the same period in 2019. In Asia Pacific, excluding the impact of the product returns in this region, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 5.4% in dollars and 2.5% in local currency over the same period in 2019. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 34.9% versus 40.2% over the same period in 2019. Excluding the impact of the product returns in this region, associated inventory provisions and related costs, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 40.3% versus 40.2% in the comparable period in 2019. Japan net sales in the quarter decreased 16.4% in dollars and 18.4% in local currency without the impact of the product returns in Japan, net sales decreased 6.7%. In December 2020, our distributor in Japan reduced their inventories, because of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Distributed depletions increased by approximately 12%, during the 2020 fourth quarter. In South Korea, net sales increased 55.8% in dollars and 52.3% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter in 2019. In China, net sales decreased 5% in dollars in the quarter and 9.6% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter in 2019. Distributor depletions increased as by approximately 29% during the 2020 fourth quarter. In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 32.6% in dollars and 25.2% in local currencies. Sales of the Monster brand in Oceania increased 32% in dollars and 24.7% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter in 2019. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 52.2% in dollars and increased 79.9% in local currencies over the same period in 2019. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 38.6% compared to 42.6% and over the same period in 2019, primarily as a result of foreign exchange rates as certain raw materials and ingredients for products in this region are purchased in U.S. dollars. In Brazil, net sales in the quarter increased by 74.9% in dollars and 133.6% in local currency. Net sales in Chile increased 72.9% in dollars and 80.3% in local currency in the quarter. Since our last earnings call in November 2020, there have been no significant updates on our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the maker of Bang Energy drinks. As this litigation and other pending proceedings with VPX are sub judice, we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today's call. In early October 2020, in the United States, we launched Ultra Water Melon and Juice Monster Papillon to the trade. We also refreshed our Juice Monster Khaos SKU into the new Juice Monster Khaotic. Initial results are positive. In late January 2021 in the United States, we launched Reign Cherry Limeade and Reign White Gummy Bear as well as Reign Inferno, Watermelon Warlord to the trade. We also launched Monster Ultra Gold in singles and in a four pack. In late February 2021, we launched our core four flavors, Monster Green, Low-carb Monster, Monster Zero Ultra and Monster Ultra Paradise, in 12-ounce slim cans targeted to the convenience retail channel and foodservice. In Canada, in January 2021, we launched Monster Ultra Fiesta and Java Monster with Oat Milk. February 2021, we launched Pacific Punch in Mexico and in Honduras, and we launched Mean Green - and in Honduras, we launched Mean Green, our second flavor of fury, which is one of our affordable energy brands. We were able to introduce a number of new products across EMEA in the 2020 fourth quarter. Unfortunately, a number of EMEA markets, including some of our largest markets have recently reintroduced lockdowns, which may adversely impact these and future product introductions. Juice Monster Mango Loco was launched in Botswana in November 2020 and in Israel in January 2021 and is now available in 40 markets across EMEA. Juice Monster Pacific Punch was launched in Italy in February 2021 and is now available in 12 markets across EMEA. Monster Ultra was launched in Serbia and Ukraine in October 2020 and is now available in 44 EMEA markets. Monster Ultra Paradise was launched in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in the fourth quarter of 2020 and is now available in 22 EMEA markets. Monster Ultra Fiesta was launched in Great Britain and Sweden in January 2021 and in Poland, Portugal, the Republic of Ireland and Spain in February 2021. The Monster Ultra Black was launched in the Republic of Ireland in October 2020, it is now available in two EMEA markets. Monster “The Doctor” was launched in Kenya in December 2020 and is now available in 44 EMEA markets. Monster Mule was launched in the Republic of Ireland in October 2020 and in Great Britain and Iceland in January 2021 and in Austria, Belgium and Norway in February 2021. Monster Mule is now available in 10 EMEA markets. Burn Zero Raspberry was launched in Hungary in October 2020. Ultra Zero Raspberry was launched in Serbia in November 2020. Predator Purple Rain was launched in Namibia in December 2020 and is now available in three EMEA markets. Reign Sour Apple variant was launched in Iceland and the Republic of Ireland in October 2020. In November 2020, we launched Monster Energy Ultra Rosa in Australia and New Zealand, in addition to Bu Energy Island Punch in Papua New Guinea. China, we piloted our new non-carbonated Monster Energy Dragons Gold in a number of provinces during the fourth quarter of 2020. Initial consumer feedback has been positive and we will commence with the national rollout of Monster Energy Dragons! gold during 2021. During the 2020 fourth quarter, we saw additional distribution gains for Monster Energy Dragon team along with Monster Energy Green and Monster Energy Ultra. During the 2020 fourth quarter, we launched Monster Energy Ultra and Monster Mango Loco in Singapore, Monster Mango Loco in Vietnam and Monster Energy Ultra in the Philippines. We are planning to launch a number of additional products and/or product lines in our domestic and international markets in 2021. During the 2020 fourth quarter, no shares were repurchased under the previously authorized repurchase program. As of February 25, 2021, approximately $441.5 million remained available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase program. We estimate January 2021 sales to be approximately 18.2% higher than in January 2020. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis, January 2021 sales would have been approximately 17.2% higher than comparable January 2020 sales. January 2021 has had two fewer selling days in January 2020. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and UNI at redetermined their production schedules, which affects the dates in which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic remains a serious concern. If COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue to intensify the negative impact on our sales, including our new product innovation launches could be prolonged and may become more severe. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Firstly, currently, the company's flavor manufacturing facility, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities and bottlers and distributors are all operating. We are continually addressing our aluminum can requirements, given our volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. Two, we are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio and are planning additional launches later in the year. Three, we are planning to continue additional launches of our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in additional international countries. More, we are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury and our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in a number of international countries during the year. Despite the obstacles of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are pleased with our performance for the quarter and the year. I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
Dara Mohsenian: Hilton, I was hoping you could discuss the commodity cost outlook as you look out to 2021, particularly on the aluminum side. I know you won't get into guidance territory, but just any conceptual thoughts would be helpful. And if we do see sustained higher commodity costs, can you discuss your willingness to potentially take pricing to offset some of the higher costs? And how you think about that? Thanks.
Hilton Schlosberg: Yeah. Dara, that's a really good question. I mean, in previous calls like this, I've spoken about the fact that we engage in contracts with aluminum can suppliers from time-to-time to fix some of our aluminum costs. And we've done a little bit of that for 2021. Obviously, we monitor aluminum costs every morning. And we've seen, as you've seen and the rest of the group have seen an increasing situation with regard to aluminum and also with the Midwest premium, which I think has taken a lot of us by surprise. The aluminum, the Midwest premium was in the upper-single digits some months ago and with the imposition of the tariffs on aluminum went up. And everyone expected that to fall. And it hasn't. It's just sitting at just below $0.16. So where we are, we're doing our best to manage our aluminum costs. And I'm not sure there's much more I can say other than, yes, we will - aluminum costs will increase over - in 2021 over 2020. So that is - that's a fact of life. And it will impact us as it will impact many other beverage companies.
Rodney Sacks: And regarding your second question about take your price increase. We're not at this time we haven't been looking at taking a price increase. However, whatever rules out, take your price increase when the right opportunity presents itself. And right now, none of our competitors have been looking at price increases. I know we led the market last time. But this time, we're cautious, as indeed, we should be with our market share. And we're examining the opportunities to take price up. And we will, if we find there's an opportunity to do so.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.
Kevin Grundy: Congratulations on the strong result. For me, I'd like to ask about the seltzer category. Specifically, you made some comments recently at your Analyst Day we could get some news here, either on the alcohol side or even non-alcohol side. I know it's a big decision. And certainly not one where you want to be beholden to any sort of time line that Wall Street may have set. But any updated thoughts here with respect to what you've decided to enter and what that timing may be? Thank you.
Hilton Schlosberg: I think that our position there is still much the same as we indicated on our last call. We are reviewing - they're very separate. If you go to the non-alcoholic side, it would be an energy product, obviously. If you go to the alcoholic side, you'd be then competing with all the other colleagues as the white claw and truly and the others that are in that category. We are continuing to evaluate both of them. We do believe we will have some news in the not too distant future, but we are looking at the positioning of what we're looking at opportunities on - particularly on the non-alcoholic side. The alcoholic side has become very crowded. And we are reviewing it. We are developing products, but whether we decide to pull the trigger and when and how is - we're just looking at where the category is going there before we make a decision on that side. So other than that, I just don't think there's much more that we can really provide to you as an update. As I said, on the non-alcoholic side, we just wouldn't like to get into those discussions and our plans in the clean energy area, which we are addressing and looking at.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
Andrea Teixeira: I was hoping if you can comment on the inventory levels at the bottlers in light, obviously, with the pandemic. And obviously not to take away from your strong volumes, did the bottlers decide to take more inventory in the fourth quarter in January and also driven by your innovation. So perhaps you were taking the new products that I think the pipeline has been stronger than ever. So, if you can comment on that or, if we should see the pace of growth continuing?
Rodney Sacks: So where we are Andrea, is an interesting territory because you can see that our sales are growing, I think, quicker than we had expected that they would. And we are doing everything we can to service our bottlers and get product to our bottlers, so they can service the retail trade. Having said that, I'm pretty confident that there's not excess inventories in the bottlers warehouses. Because I know what - that we're doing everything we can to satisfy their demand, and they have not been terribly happy with us in terms of getting product, because cans - excess cans are tight. And we're doing everything we can to service customers in an area where the market is growing quicker than our expectations. So from that perspective, I don't believe that the distributors are carrying any excess inventory in their system. And we also know, of course, we monitor depletions and depletions are in line with our shipments.
Thomas Kelly: With regard to specific countries, I think we've already indicated in the transcript, we did make mention of the fact that of the differential in certain selected countries where we saw our distributors reducing their stock holding slightly because of anticipated slowdowns in retail in those particular countries.
Rodney Sacks: That's correct. We spoke about that in China and Japan. And that is correct.
Thomas Kelly: So we've given you those sort of indications. But other than that, seem to be reasonably good shape.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.
Mark Astrachan: I guess I'm going to try to cheat and ask a short follow-up and then another question. I guess on the follow-up what prevents you from working more with the Coke system in procuring aluminium and manufacturing in general, so that you have a bit more of sharing of ability to supply bottlers. And second separate question is just could you update us, Rodney, probably on where you are from an SKU standpoint in terms of international markets sort of broadly versus where you are in the U.S., meaning, how many do you have on a typical shelf outside the U.S.? And what's the opportunity going forward for that?
Hilton Schlosberg: So let me start, Mark. In terms of working with the Coca-Cola bottlers and working with the Coca-Cola system on procurement of cans, we're doing what we can to produce within the Coca-Cola network. Obviously, that's something that we like to do because it reduces shipping costs and improves efficiencies. But there are a whole bunch of products that we manufacture that cannot be manufactured at a Coca-Cola facility. We do a wide range of products from hot four to and those products cannot be manufactured at a Coca-Cola facility. So where we can, we try and work with the system. And obviously, that's our major focus. And that's been improving over the years. We've opened up a number of Coca-Cola facilities to produce Monster. On the other hand, on procurement, which is a question you asked, that's been a longer-term project, and we haven't resolved that situation yet. The Coke bottlers have their own organization, which is for the Coca-Cola bottling situation. We are not a bottler. And we don't fall within that mandate. So that's been a difficult discussion. And it's something that I'm hoping that we'll be able to progress in the future. But right now, we're doing our own procurement of all our raw materials, including aluminum and including cans. So Rodney you asked that, you answer the second question. Sure. Go ahead.
Rodney Sacks: Yes. On the second one it's various from country to country, Mark. But if you try and take it as an average, the number of SKUs that we have in distribution internationally is substantially less than we have than our range of SKUs that we have in the U.S. And so we are continuing to expand the number of SKUS. But it does vary. And in some countries, we're trying to start accelerating that instead of doing just one a year. We're actually increasing the pace of innovation going on shelves. But it does vary quite dramatically from country-to-country. And where we can get receptiveness from retailers to increase the energy space, we obviously take advantage of that and increase more. And so we did, as you would have noticed from the call, we went into quite a lot of depth in EMEA in places like of new products and where we're introducing new flavors, because that pace is accelerating, but there is quite a long runway internationally for international markets to get up to the U.S. levels. And there are many products that haven't yet been launched at all in the international market. So the rehab products are in very few markets internationally, we just starting to launch some of the Hydro products. So there are a number of product lines or we call them as sub-families that aren't yet - don't appear in many international markets at all. So there is opportunity there. But it all depends on the appetite of retailers and their willingness to grant additional space. But I think that as we've seen everywhere, the category does increase sales - on a sales per unit basis, it is a hiring than other - a lot of other comparable beverages, competitive beverages. And so we are seeing a receptiveness from retailers to continually recognizing the category and increasing the allocation of space.
Hilton Schlosberg: Yes. It's just an evolution. It's a question of time. We generally start one or two SKUs, and we build from there. And if you look across the various countries that we are distributed in, some have more or less depending on when we started and the appetite for taking on additional products. But as the energy category grows, there is a huge opportunity to be able to do that. And then in some countries like in China, we've actually launched unique items that are not available in the U.S. In Brazil, we have a tea product, for example, that's also not available in the U.S. So there are a bunch of products under the Monster brand that are not available in the U.S. that are distributed internationally and of course, our strategic brands are in various countries in the world, many of those - many of the flavors that we sell in other parts of the world are not available in the U.S. So it really is a mixed bag and as we see an opportunity.
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Galbo from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.
Peter Galbo: Rodney, I just wanted to ask on capital allocation. It's been a couple of quarters, I guess, since we've seen some meaningful share repurchase. You talked about the authorization outstanding. Just help us kind of think about your appetite to do more potentially in 2021 and beyond. Thanks.
Rodney Sacks: I think that what we did was we were quite active in the market, and then we saw an increase in uptick in the share price. And so we just sort of sat patiently, and that has moved forward. But again, as part of, I think, our own just review of our own opportunities and what we want to do, we've sort of been a bit patient because we are reviewing a number of additional potential product categories and sectors, and so until we make up our minds to determine how do we go about or address them. We're just sort of taking a cautious approach. And we'll see later in the year, whether we have the cash. And we'll decide on how to employ that, whether to use that to repurchase shares or potentially some other purposes. But we just wanted to rather be in a position to make - to be flexible in making that decision going forward. But if we don't have any other use for it, depending on our direction, we will continue to resume purchasing repurchases of shares.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference call back over to Mr. Sacks and Schlosberg for any closing remarks.
Rodney Sacks: Thanks very much. On behalf of the company, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad, and in particular, to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola Bottler system internationally. We believe that we will be able to navigate through the challenges ahead as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and hope that this unfortunate situation will resolve itself in the not-too-distant future. We believe that we are well positioned in the energy drink category and continue to be optimistic about our total portfolio of energy drink brands. We hope that you will all stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, with that we will conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-11-06 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Corporation Third Quarter 2020 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead.
Rodney Sacks: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is on the call; as is Tom Kelly, our Executive Vice President of Finance. Tom Kelly will now read the cautionary announcement.
Thomas Kelly: Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends as well as the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's business and operation. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call.  Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2020, and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed on August 6, 2020, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance.  The company assumes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated November 5, 2020. A copy of this information is also available on our website: www.monsterbevcorp.com, in the Financial Information section. I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you, Tom. Let me begin by saying that our thoughts and prayers are with all of those who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we achieved record third quarter net sales and the highest quarterly net sales in the company's history. While our performance in EMEA was solid in the third quarter, EMEA remained adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Since mid-March 2020, we have seen a shift in consumer channel preferences and package configurations, including an increase in at-home consumption and a decrease in food service on-premise consumption. Our sales in the 2020 second quarter were initially adversely affected as a result of a decrease in foot traffic in the convenience and gas channel, which is our largest channel, but improved sequentially from the latter half of the 2020 second quarter and throughout the 2020 third quarter.  Now e-commerce, club store, mass merchandiser and grocery related business continued to increase in the quarter, while our food service on-premise business, which is a small channel for the company, remained challenged. Currently, we do not foresee a material impact on the ability of our co-packers to manufacture, and our bottlers and distributors to distribute our products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  In addition, we are not experiencing significant raw material or finished product shortages, and our supply chain remains intact. We are continually addressing our aluminum can requirements, given our volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. With certain countries, particularly in EMEA, returning to lockdowns and other restrictions, consumer demand could be impacted, and we are unsure of what impact this may have, if any, on our future performance.  Monster Energy Cares, our philanthropic arm, continues to be actively engaged in a number of philanthropic efforts, including donating products to individuals working on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as those involved with the recent natural disasters in the U.S. Based on currently available information, we do not expect to COVID-19 pandemic to have a material impact on our liquidity.  In the third quarter of 2020, net sales were $1.25 billion as compared with $1.13 billion in the third quarter of 2019. Adjusting for foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2020 third quarter would have been up 11.1%. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2020 third quarter was 59.1% compared with 59.4% in the 2019 third quarter.  Decrease for the 2020 third quarter was primarily the result of geographical sales mix and higher allowances as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by favorable aluminum can pricing. Operating expenses for the 2020 third quarter were $277.9 million compared to $277.6 million in the 2019 third quarter.  As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2020 third quarter were 22.3% compared to 24.5% in the 2019 third quarter, primarily the result of decreased expenditures for sponsorships and endorsements of $14.1 million and decreased expenditures of $9.3 million for travel and entertainment, each largely as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The costs for certain postponed or rescheduled events have been or may be deferred to future periods. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the company is unable to estimate in which future periods, if any, such deferred sponsorship and endorsement costs will be recognized.  The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by increased payroll expenses of $14.5 million, increased expenditures of $7.4 million for social media and digital marketing and increased outbound freight and warehouse costs of $6 million.  Operating income was $458.6 million up from $395.4 million in the third quarter of 2019. Net income increased 16.3% to $347.7 million as compared to $298.9 million in the 2019 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2020 third quarter increased 19.6% to $0.65 from $0.55 in the third quarter of 2019.

The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is the short period, that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen for the month of September 2020, compared to September 2019, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 27.9% to 44.1%, in Brazil from 26.1% to 33.3% and in Chile from 38% to 45.6%. Since the launch of Monster Energy in Argentina in the first quarter of 2018, Monster Energy is now the leading energy brand in value in both Argentina and Chile. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country.  According to Nielsen in the 13-week period to the end of September and beginning of October 2020, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 12.9% to 13.4% in Belgium, from 21.5% to 25.3% in Great Britain, from 20.7% to 21.4% in Italy, from 14.9% to 20% in Poland, from 33.3% to 35.5% in Spain, but declined from 27.6% to 25.4% in France, from 15.7% to 14.1% in Germany and from 7.2% to 7.1% in the Netherlands.  According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period to the end of August and the beginning of September, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 23.6% to 25.2% in Denmark, from 23.9% to 28.6% in Norway, from 23% to 26.2% in the Republic of Ireland, from 17.4% to 20.2% in South Africa and from 13% to 13.3% in Sweden, while it remained flat at 36.6% in Greece and declined from 13.4% to 13% in the Czech Republic.  The Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to IRI in Australia, Monster's market share in value for the 4 weeks ending October 11, 2020, increased from 9.8% to 12.7% as compared to the same period the previous year. Mother's market share in value decreased from 12.7% to 11.9% during the same period. The market share of the company's brands in Australia for the 4 weeks ended October 11, 2020 increased from 22.5% to 24.6%.  According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the 4 weeks ended October 11, 2020, increased from 8.4% to 11.5% as compared to the same period the previous year. Live Plus market share in value decreased from 7.9% to 7.3%, and Mother's market share in value increased from 5.9% to 6.1%. The market share of the company's brands in New Zealand for the 4 weeks ended October 11, 2020, increased from 22.2% to 24.9%.  According to Nielsen in South Korea, Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined for the third quarter of 2020 grew from 41.5% to 54.8% as compared to the same period in the previous year. According to INTAGE in Japan, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel for the third quarter of 2020 increased from 51.2% to 55% as compared to the same period in the previous year.  We, again, point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or 4 week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during these periods.  Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $444.5 million, 35.7% of total net sales in the 2020 third quarter compared to $379.8 million or 33.5% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2019. Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $12.5 million in the 2020 third quarter. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.  In EMEA, net sales in the third quarter increased 15.8% in dollars and increased 15.7% in local currencies over the same period in 2019. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 39.5% compared to 39.3% in the same quarter in 2019. Gross profit percentage for the region was impacted by foreign exchange rates. It would have been slightly higher at 40.1% in local currencies. We're also pleased that in the third quarter, Monster gained market share in Belgium, Denmark, Great Britain, Italy, Norway, Poland, Republic of Ireland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden. In Asia Pacific, net sales in the third quarter increased 23.1% in dollars and 22.8% in local currencies over the same period in 2019.  Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 43.2% versus 40.5% over the same period in 2019. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 4.6% in dollars and 3.9% in local currency. In South Korea, net sales increased 170.7% in dollars and 174.3% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2019. In China, net sales increased 20.6% in dollars in the quarter and 22.7% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2019. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 38.1% in dollars and 35% in local currencies.  Sales of the Monster brand in Oceania increased 54.7% in dollars and 50.3% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2019. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the third quarter increased 6.1% in dollars and 31.9% in local currencies over the same period in 2019. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 42.9% compared to 44% over the same period in 2019. In Brazil, net sales in the quarter increased by 38.5% in dollars and 90.3% in local currency. Net sales in Chile decreased 21.1% in dollars and 11.8% in local currency in the quarter.  I will now briefly discuss our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., VPX, the maker of Bang Energy drinks. Several proceedings are currently ongoing with VPX, including claims for false advertising and trademark and trade dress infringement brought by the company against VPX and by VPX against the company. The company's lawsuit for unfair competition, false advertising and misappropriation of trade secrets is scheduled for trial in September 2021. In VPX's lawsuit against the company, returning to its allegation that Reign infringes the Bang trade risk, VPX's trade dress infringement claims were trialed in the Southern District of California in late August and early September and the company is awaiting a final judgment on these claims.
Hilton Schlosberg: Rod, it's the Southern District of Florida.
Rodney Sacks: Of Florida, sorry, of Florida. I beg your pardon. As this litigation and other pending proceedings with VPX are sub judice, we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today's call. In the United States, we launched Reign Total Body Fuel, Lilikoi Lychee in August 2020. And in early October, we launched Ultra Watermelon, Juice Monster Papillon and Juice Monster Khaotic to the retail trade.  In Canada, during the third quarter of 2020, Ultra Rosa was launched in July, followed by the launch of Reign Energy in August in 4 flavors. In El Salvador, we launched Fury Gold Strike as our first entry in the country in the affordable energy category during July, which is performing well.  In August 2020, we launched Ultra Paradise in Brazil in our largest LATAM market. Additionally, in September 2020 in Brazil, we launched Reign Total Body Fuel in 2 flavors. June 2020, we launched Ultra Paradise in Argentina and in August 2020, we launched Ultra Paradise in Chile. As markets eased restrictions after lockdowns, we were able to introduce a number of new products across EMEA in the third quarter.  Unfortunately, a number of EMEA markets, including some of our largest markets, have recently reintroduced lockdowns, which may adversely impact these and future product introductions. Juice Monster Pacific Punch was launched in Norway and Poland in September 2020 and is now available in 12 markets across EMEA.  Juice Monster Pipeline Punch was launched in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in August 2020 and is now available in 23 markets across EMEA. We are planning to launch Juice Monster Pacific Punch in an additional 5 markets later in 2020. Juice Monster Mango Loco was launched in Namibia in July 2020 and Mozambique and Mayotte in August 2020 and is now available in 38 markets across EMEA.  We are planning to launch Juice Monster Mango Loco in an additional 7 markets in 2020. Monster Ultra Paradise was launched in Iceland, Poland and South Africa in August 2020, and in Malta in September 2020 and is now available in 18 EMEA markets.  We are planning to launch Monster Ultra in an additional 3 markets in 2020. The Monster Mule was launched in Poland in July 2020, and in Germany, Sweden and South Africa in September 2020. We're planning to launch Monster Mule in an additional 5 markets in 2020.  Espresso Monster, mocha and vanilla variants were launched in Hungary in September and are now available in 21 markets in EMEA. Reign Total Body Fuel was launched in Norway and Iceland in September, and is now available in 8 markets in EMEA.  We are planning to launch Reign Total Body Fuel in an additional 4 markets in 2020. We launched Predator, our primary affordable energy brand in Ethiopia in August 2020, and we've also introduced Predator Purple Rain in South Africa in September 2020. We launched Burn Gold Spark in Turkey in August 2020, and we launched Burn Peach Zero in Hungary and Ukraine in August 2020.  In Japan, in the third quarter of 2020, we launched Ultra Paradise in approximately 90% of the country. We are continuing to build on our #1 country share position in value. In South Korea, in the third quarter of 2020, Monster Energy increased its #1 share position in value. We launched Ultra Paradise in late June. In China, in May 2020, we began distribution of our new noncarbonated Monster Energy Dragon Tea, which has received early positive consumer feedback.  During the 2020 third quarter, we saw additional distribution gains for Monster Energy Dragon Tea, along with Monster Green and Ultra White. Large parts of India still remain in national lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the 2020 third quarter, no shares were repurchased under the previously authorized repurchase program. As of November 5, 2020, approximately 441.5 million remained available for repurchase and under the previously authorized share repurchase program.  We estimate October 2020 gross sales to be approximately 14.8% higher than in October 2019. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis, October 2020, gross sales would have been approximately 14.9% higher than comparable October 2019 gross sales.  October 2020 had one less selling day than October 2019. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.  We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic remains a serious concern. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue to intensify the negative impact on our sales, including our new product innovation launches could be prolonged and may become more severe.  In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. The company's priority has been and remains the health and safety of our employees. Currently, the company's flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities and bottlers and distributors are all operating. We are continually addressing our aluminum can requirements, given our volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry.  We are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio. We are encouraged by the prospects for our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks and Reign Inferno Thermogenic Fuel high-performance energy drinks. We are planning for future launches of our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in certain countries outside of the U.S.  We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury and our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans for future launches of our affordable energy brands outside of the United States. Despite the obstacles of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are pleased with our performance for the quarter and for the 9-month period ended September 30, 2020. I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question today will come from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.
Dara Mohsenian: So we've seen category growth come back at pretty healthy levels looking at the U.S. and Europe. You mentioned the sequential improvement within Q2. Obviously, October seems solid. So I was just hoping you could give us a bit of your perspective on category growth here post COVID. Are you seeing more of a sustained pickup perhaps people are substituting energy drinks for coffee shop consumption? Or should we still expect sort of below pre COVID growth levels with the consumer not back to full mobility? Just really wanted to get some perspective on category growth. And I'm thinking more longer-term ex restrictions, but while you're on the subject, perhaps you could touch on the short-term risk from the second round of restrictions also?
Rodney Sacks: All right. I'll take that. I think that we're in an area of uncertainty. I think everybody is guessing as to whether people are going to be switching from coffee to energy. I think what we do know is that there are substantial channels, which is from the convenience channel to larger packages and take-home packages.  I think that's, obviously, also impacted the certain impact, for example, on-premise, I think the -- some of our competitors have substantial on-premise businesses. I think those businesses have been impacted more severely than we have because we have smaller on-premise.  But I think that's resulted in some channel switching. So how this is -- this mix is all going to pan out, at the end of the day, we really -- I think it's just speculative for us to anticipate. But what we do know is, obviously, we've seen the trends. We're seeing the higher sell rates for the category. We are seeing our own numbers through Nielsen.  And obviously, our own numbers internally in the company continuing to strengthen. We've had good momentum and we've got good innovation. I think the innovation this year has been very disrupted all over the world. We launched some products just before COVID hit, some products during COVID, some products we've tried to get out late in summer. And I think a lot of those things are still disrupting our sales, but we obviously feel that as we go forward, I think things will settle down more.  But again, we just don't know. You're having Europe sort of going backwards again a number of their countries are now starting to impose restrictions. So we don't know how this will all turn out, Dara. It's just too speculative for us to give you any real guidance. I just don't think anybody really knows.
Hilton Schlosberg: Maybe I can just add a little color, if you wouldn't mind. So what we're seeing is that caffeine is a need state for consumers, okay? And we're also seeing that energy drinks are an affordable luxury. So even though people are at home in greater quantities than they've been before, they're drinking more energy drinks and they could very much as well drink coffee, which they're doing, which is obviously the cup is cheaper than an energy drink.  So I think we're not going to go back to where we were before. We're going to go back to somewhere that's kind of in the middle of where we were and where we are now. And so my color is -- and I don't give guidance, we never give guidance. But if I'm thinking about the category and the category growth that has been sustained in this time of COVID, it's -- you can enjoy your own conclusions, but that's the kind of color that I've been thinking of.
Operator: And our next question will come from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.
Andrea Teixeira: Can you help us with the sales cadence in the quarter? Was there any reason like retailers rebuilding inventory ahead of the -- any potential pricing to explain this lumpiness in a certain amount of region? I guess from the strong July that you included in the last call, implied a deceleration in August and September, to high single digits, but then sharply reaccelerated now in October. And just a follow-up commentary about EMEA. What is your view of the impact of the lockdowns now and the current mobility as well?
Rodney Sacks: I didn't hear that very much of what you were saying. It was very unclear. I don't know if you heard it, Hilton, perhaps you could...
Hilton Schlosberg: Yes. I think Andrea was talking about Red Bull. Is that correct?
Andrea Teixeira: No. Yes, sorry for the technical issues, but I was just asking about the sales cadence in the quarter. Was there any reason why you saw some in July and then...
Hilton Schlosberg: Okay. You're talking about our cadence?
Andrea Teixeira: Yes, your cadence. Correct.
Hilton Schlosberg: Yes. So what happened, and we can go through the history on that, but what happened was that our bottlers decreased inventories, and we spoke about that. And then there comes a time when they have to order to get to inventories back to where they should be, bearing in mind the depletions. So there's been a steady percentage growth in depletions, which were not sort of matched by orders.  And so what you've seen in the quarter is a steady rebuild of inventories in the distribution system in order to support the growth at retail. And also what happened in the quarter was that many of our bottlers were back, particularly in the U.S. in more full force, so they were covering the stores in a better frequency than they had in the past. So that's where we saw that acceleration.  And then your second question was about EMEA. And I would refer you to what happened in the first and second quarters in EMEA. The third quarter, particularly in EMEA, was really strong. But the EMEA guys felt there was still a lot of runway. So we know what October is and we've spoken about October. In November and December, we'll -- as again, we don't give guidance, but we don't know what the impact of the lockdowns are going to be, but we've got some sense for what happened earlier this year.
Operator: And our next question will come from Mark Astrachan with Stifel.
Mark Astrachan: I guess just building on one of the earlier questions on the U.S. Not that it's not improving as pandemic lessens and mobility increases. More curious your thoughts about the still disconnect that we're seeing in the data between your business and Red Bull or even Red Bull share gains versus the category. So you mentioned that you're doing a better job. You talked about that last earnings call about the coast system being back in the market, I think, right around July or so. But Red Bull is now growing close to 20%. So what do you think is really contributing to their outperformance? And how do you think that sustains, if it does, as we go into next year, and they, in particular, have to lap that and you guys have to lap easier comparisons?
Rodney Sacks: I think Red Bull probably going to start having a tougher time on comparisons. But I think what they -- what you can see is they've got a lot of impetus in the 12 ounce. We think there's been some increased consumption because a lot of Red Bull's business was done in the bars. And I think people who are just not going to bars but are still using Red Bull as mixes are probably following them in the off-premise channels. And that's, I think, we think it could be contributing to some of their increase.  As I think we said on the last call, I think that the Red Bull has a very dedicated and focused distribution system. And they, I think, stayed in the field and had focused much, much better than not only Coke, but Pepsi's and every -- all of the bigger companies. I think that is -- we are still seeing the effects of that. Their execution has been good. And you can see that in comparison to some of the other competitors who are negative, even though one would have expected some of them to have started going into positive territory. And so that's an issue which we are addressing. They had some good innovation, but the innovation has now sort of leveled off a little bit, but you're seeing large gains, particularly as I said in the 12 ounce, right across their whole line, including the -- some of the original products.  And I think that we're getting back. We've got new products introduced now. I think we've got to get a little more focus and what we've done is we are now stepping up. We have basically created a new division with a street team having -- we've appointed a Chief Field Execution Officer with a pretty -- a lot of dedicated group of people under him to really focus.  I think we've probably been underperforming, and we've had not enough attention in the independents where you get trial and variation for -- and particularly trial for your innovation. So we are gearing up with what we're calling our street team. So that's something new and that we're going to implement. We're in the throes of it right now, and it will start being fully operational in the next month or 2. And then as we get it going, we're going to expand it. We think that will address a lot of the independent channel where we think that we perhaps have fallen a little behind. That being said, we are still obviously growing very nicely. And it's a question of the disparate proportion between us and Red Bull.  But if you look at the rest of the category, we're doing well. If you look at Reign, it's growing at about the same rate as Red Bull. And we think that for some of our new innovation that we've just launched, have been really well received, the Ultra Watermelon. And the 2 juice products, we have some good innovation coming next year. Once things settle down, we think that we will get -- we'll be in a good position to attack that differential.
Operator: Our next question will come from Peter Galbo with Bank of America.
Peter Galbo: And maybe just to piggyback on Mark's question and talk a little bit about the innovation. I guess just with the introduction of Watermelon, a, has that shipped at this point? And maybe just talk to us a little bit about what you observed with seasonality with that product. And help us understand, I guess, in your own internal planning, how you're thinking about how big that line could be relative to, say, an Ultra Paradise or a Fiesta or a Rosa?
Rodney Sacks: It has shipped. It shipped at the beginning of October. And it's had a very good reception, both from our bottlers and from retailers. Very initial indications of sales per point in some of the retail chains are showing that it's really doing well. It's ahead of some of the others. I mean the Ultra Fiesta was a really good launch earlier this year and is continuing. Those are still new products, and that's continuing to grow.  But this is actually starting to outpace those ones after 3 to 4 weeks, we're actually seeing a higher rate of sale. But we've launched it now. We don't -- I think that like everything, it's -- it does get affected by the winter months, but we think that being a 0-calorie product, it will help the product. And we're quite optimistic for Watermelon as a really good opportunity. It's a really good product. And the whole Ultra line is continuing to perform really well. So any color on that, Hilton?
Hilton Schlosberg: Yes. The only thing I would add is that the energy drink category is not as seasonal, as for example, sodas and other soft drinks and beer. And it is 0-calorie. It's on trend. We're seeing higher rates of sales in some of our major retailers. So as we transition into the January's and the better-for-you months, it's really very much on trend.
Operator: And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks.
Rodney Sacks: Thanks. On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-08-05 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Company Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode [Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead sir.
Rodney Sacks: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I am Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President is on the call as is Tom Kelly, our Executive Vice President of Finance. Tom Kelly will now read our cautionary announcement.
Tom Kelly: Before we begin, I'd like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended and are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends, as well as the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's business and operations.

A copy of this information is also available on our Web site, www.monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. I would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks.
Rodney Sacks: Let me begin by stating that our thoughts and prayers are with all who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, our top priority has been the health, safety and well being of our employees. As mentioned on our previous call in early March 2020, we implemented global travel restrictions and work from home policies for employees who are able to work remotely. For those employees who are unable to work remotely safety precautions have been instituted, which were developed and adopted in line with guidance from public health authorities and professional consultants. Our offices have partially reopened in the United States and in certain countries and our field sales teams are operating in the field with our bottlers, distributors and retailers subject to safety protocols. We are incredibly proud of the teamwork exhibited by our employees, co-packers and bottlers and distributors around the world who are ensuring the integrity of our supply chain. Our flavor manufacturing facilities are co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities are all operating. Certain of our bottlers and distributors have implemented modifications to their coal points and service levels. But generally our products remain available to consumers. In limited countries, the operations of our bottlers and distributors have been more affected. The COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse impact on our net and gross sales for the 2020 second quarter, in part due to certain of our bottlers and distributors, reducing their inventory levels. However, we did see a sequential improvement in sales in the latter half of the quarter, as certain countries and states began to gradually reopen. Since mid-March 2020, the company has seen a shift in consumer channel preferences and package configurations, including an increase in at home consumption and a decrease in immediate consumption. Our sales in the second quarter were initially adversely affected as a result of a decrease in foot traffic in the convenience and gas channel, which is our largest channel, but improved sequentially throughout the quarter. Our ecommerce, clubs store, mass merchandiser, and grocery and related business continue to increase in the quarter while our food service on-premise business which is a small channel for us remains challenged. Currently, we do not foresee a material impact on the ability of our co-packers to manufacture and our bottlers and distributors to distribute our products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we are not experiencing raw material or finished product shortages in our supply chain. Monster Energy Cares, our philanthropic arm continues to be actively engaged in a number of philanthropic efforts, including donating products to individuals working on the front lines, such as first responders, healthcare workers, hospitals and the National Guard. Based on currently available information, we do not expect the COVID-19 pandemic to have a material impact on our liquidity. In the second quarter of 2020, net sales were $1.09 billion compared with $1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2019. Adjusting for foreign currency movements in itself for the 2020 second quarter would have been up approximately 1%. The COVID-19 pandemic's impact was more pronounced in EMEA during the quarter. In particular, the reduction in revenue from our strategic brands segment was significant as our larger revenue generating countries in EMEA experienced extended lockdowns. Operating income was 407.3 million, up from 379 million in the second quarter of 2019, due in part to lower sponsorship and endorsement costs of 19.8 million, as well as lower travel and entertainment expenses of 10.1 million. The cost for certain postponed or rescheduled events have been or maybe deferred to future periods. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, we are unable to estimate in which future periods if any such deferred sponsorship and endorsement costs will be recognized. Net income increased 6.5% to 311.4 million as compared to 292.5 million in the 2019 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2020 second quarter increased 9.9% to $0.59 from $0.53 in the second quarter of 2019. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through July 18 2020, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots increased by 7.6% versus the same period a year ago.

According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended July 18, 2020, sales in dollars in the coffee plus energy drink category, which includes our Java Monster line in the convenience and gas channel increased 10.2% over the same period the previous year. Sales of Java monster were 24.6% higher in the same period versus the previous year. Sales of Starbucks energy were 12.3% higher. Java Monster share of the coffee plus energy category which primarily includes Java Monster, Java Monster 300, Starbucks Double Shot and Triple Shot, Rockstar Roasted and Bang Keto Coffee for the four weeks ended July 18, 2020 was 51.1% up 5.9 points while Starbucks energy share was 47% up point 8 points. Cafe Monster and Espresso Monster have been discontinued in the United States. According to Stackline, which tracks energy drink sales by Amazon in the United States for the four week period ending July 18, 2020, sales in dollars in the energy category by Amazon, including energy shots increased 190% over the same period the previous year. Sales of Monster increased 269.4% and its share was 39.5% up 8.5 share points versus the same period a year ago. Red Bull sales increased 172.4% and its share was 14.5% down 0.9 of a point. Celsius sales increased 213% and its share increased 0.8 of a point to 11.3%. 5-Hour sales increased 50.5% and its share declined 3.8 points to 4.2%. VPX Bang sales increased 66.1% and its share declined 2.7 share points to 3.7%, Reign share was 5.5% and Rockstar share was 1.7%. According to Nielsen in all major channels in Canada for the 12 weeks ended June 30, 2020, the energy drink category increased 6.8% in dollars. Sales of the company's energy drink brands increased 6.9% versus a year ago. The market share of the company's energy drink brands was 37.8%, the same as in the previous year. Monster's market share increased 0.2 of a point to 34.9. NOS's sales increased 7.6% and its market share remained the same at 2.1%.

Rockstar sales decreased 5.2% and its market share decreased 2.1 points to 16%. [Group] [ph] sales increased 35.7% and its share increased 0.7 of a share point to 3.2%. According to Nielsen for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category declined 11.8% for the month of June 2020. Monster sales decreased 18.9%. Our market share in value decreased 2.4 points to 27.8% against the comparable period the previous year. Burn has been discontinued in Mexico; Red Bull sales decreased 30.3% and its market share decreased by 1.8 points to 6.8%. The Vive 100 sales decreased 32.6% and its market share decreased by 7 points to 22.5%. Volts sales increased 0.2 of a percent and its market share increased 2.2 share points to 18.8%. While Boost sales decreased 10.7% and its market share increased 0.1 of point to 7.4%. [Indiscernible] sales increased 269% and its market share increased 7.5 points to 13.6. Coca-Cola energy's market share was 0.9 of a percentage point. Predator which was launched in March 2020 achieved a market share of 1.4%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, subjectivities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen for the month of June 2020, compared to June 2019. Monsters retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 25.4% to 39.4%; in Brazil from 21.1% to 30.4%; and in Chile from 37.4% to 44.9%. Since the launch of Monster Energy in Argentina in the first quarter of 2018, Monster is now the leading energy brand in volume in Argentina. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ended mid-June 2020. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 22.1% to 25.6% in Denmark; grew from 20.8% to 24.8% in Great Britain; grew from 24.2% to 28.4% in Norway; grew from 21.9% to 24.9% in the Republic of Ireland; grew from 32.2% to 34.8% in Spain; and grew from 12.8% to 13.8% in Sweden, but declined from 13.1% to 12.5% in Belgium; from 27% to 25.9% in France; and from 7.4% to 6.3% in the Netherlands. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period to the end of May 2020, Monster's retail market sharing value is compared to the same period the previous year grew from 34.7% to 35.2% increase, from 13.7% to 17.7% in Poland, from 16.4% to 17.7% in South Africa, while it remained flat at 13.3% in the Czech Republic, and declined from 16% to 15.1% in Germany and from 18.5% to 16.8% in Italy. The Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channel is read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to IRI in Australia, Monster's market chain value for the four weeks ended July 5, 2020 increased from 9.4% to 11.9%. As compared to the same period the previous year, Mother's market share in value decreased from 13.9% to 13.3% during the same period. Market share of the company brands in Australia for the four weeks ended July 5, 2020, increased from 23.3% to 25.2%. According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the four weeks ended June 21, 2020 increased from 7.8% to 10.4%. As compared to the same period the previous year, Live+ market share in value decreased from 8.3% to 7.1%. And Mother's market share in value decreased from 6.5% to 6.4%. Market share of the company's brands in New Zealand for the four weeks ended June 21, 2020 increased from 22.6% to 23.8%. According to Nielsen in South Korea, Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined for the month ending June 2020 grew from 39.4% to 53.3% as compared to the same period in the previous year. According to INTAGE in Japan, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel for the month of June 2020 declined from 52.5% to 51.1% as compared to the same period in the previous year. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or four week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were 328.3 million, 30% of total net sales in the 2020 second quarter, compared to 343.3 million or 31.1% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2019. The decrease was largely due to the reduction of sales in EMEA during the quarter. Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately 18.2 2 million in the 2020 second quarter. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and trans-shipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA, net sales in the second quarter decreased 20.4% in dollars and decreased 15.9% in local currencies over the same period in 2019. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 38.1% compared to 39.5% in the same quarter in 2019. Gross profit percentage for the region was adversely impacted by foreign exchange rates, country and product mix. In local currencies gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 39.4%. The COVID-19 pandemics adverse impact on net sales was more pronounced in EMEA for the three months ended June 30, 2020 particularly in the strategic brands segment. Net sales in EMEA will also adversely impacted by the reduction in inventories by certain of our bottlers and distributors. In addition, to a lesser extent, the trading dispute between Coca-Cola bottlers and the European buying group primarily in Western Europe resulted in the temporary delisting of some Coca-Cola and Monster products, which had an adverse impact on itself in EMEA for the three months ended June 30, 2020. We are pleased that in the second quarter Monster gained market share in Denmark, Great Britain, Greece, Norway, Poland, Republic of Ireland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden. In Asia Pacific, net sales in the second quarter increased 30.4% in dollars and 30.9% in local currencies over the same period in 2019. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 43.3% versus 43.6% over the same period in 2019. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 41.8% in dollars and 37.5% in local currency. In South Korea, net sales increased 46.9% in dollars and 55.7% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2019. In China net sales increased 66.9% in dollars in the quarter and 74.4% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2019. In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales decreased 32.3% in dollars and 24.9% in local currencies, sales of the Monster brand decreased 25.6% in dollars and 17.9% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2019, while the strategic brands in this region decreased at a faster rate. Net sales in this region were adversely affected as a result of our bottlers' distributors, reducing their inventory levels in Latin America, which includes Mexico and the Caribbean. Net sales in the second quarter decreased 9.7% in dollars and increased 10.8% in local currencies. Gross profit of the same period in 2019, gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 41.2% compared to 43.3% of the same period in 2019. In Brazil, net sales in the quarter decreased by 1% in dollars, but increased 31.2% in local currency. Net sales in Chile increased 30.8% in dollars and 62.3% in local currency in the quarter. I will now briefly discuss our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc, VPX the maker of Bang energy drinks. Several proceedings are currently ongoing with VPX, including claims for false advertising and trademark and trade dress infringement, brought by the company against VPX and by VPX against the company. The company's lawsuit for unfair competition, false advertising and misappropriation of trade secrets, is scheduled for trial in April 2021. VPX's lawsuit against the company which VPX claims trademark infringement of the newly acquired Reign trademark and the company counter-claimed for cancellation of their trademark. The district court judge ruled in the company's favor in respect of the trademark infringement claims, finding that the company had superior rights to the Reign trademark in connection with energy drinks and cancelling the Reign trademark that VPX had purchased. VPX remains [indiscernible] from selling Reign branded energy drinks, VPX's trade dress infringement claims in these proceedings are scheduled for trial at the end of August 2020. As this litigation and other pending proceedings with VPX are subjugate, we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today's call. In the United States, our bottlers focused on relaunching our first quarter product innovation, which launch plans, were disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Canada, we did not launch any new items within the second quarter of 2020 and continue to grow our distribution of all first quarter 2020 innovations. In Honduras, we launched Fury, Gold Strike in the affordable energy category during April 2020 and in Salvador in early July 2020, initial results have been positive. In June 2020, we launched Ultra Paradise in Argentina and Puerto Rico. Additionally, in June 2020, we launched Monster Mango Loco in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. In New Zealand, we launched Monster Energy Mule and Mother Tropical Blast during April 2020. Despite a lockdown in majority of EMEA markets for most of the second quarter, we have still been able to introduce new products across EMEA. Juice Monster Pacific Punch was launched in Spain in June 2020 and is now available in 10 markets across EMEA and we plan to launch Juice Monster Pacific Punch in an additional two markets in 2020. Juice Monster Pipeline Punch was launched in Romania in May 2020 and is now available in 21 markets across EMEA and we plan to launch Juice Monster Pipeline Punch in an additional eight markets in 2020. Juice Monster Mango Loco was launched in Switzerland in June 2020 and is now available in 35 markets across EMEA. We plan to launch Juice Monster Mango Loco in an additional 10 markets in 2020. Monster Ultra Paradise was launched in Austria, the Baltics and Hungary in May 2020, in Denmark and Spain in June 2020, in Poland in July 2020, and is now available in 14 EMEA markets and we plan to launch Monster Ultra Paradise in an additional seven markets in 2020. Espresso Monster Milk and Vanilla variants are now available in 20 markets in EMEA and we plan to launch Espresso Monster Milk and Vanilla variants in an additional two markets in 2020. Monster Hydra Sport was launched in Spain in May 2020 and we plan to launch Monster Hydra Sport in an additional market in 2020. We are also pleased with the performance of Reign and we plan to launch Reign in an additional six markets in 2020. We launched Monster Mule in Poland in July 20 and plan to launch Monster Mule in an additional nine markets in 2020. We launched Predator a primary affordable energy brand in Nigeria in June 2020. Additionally, we are planning to launch Predator in Ethiopia in the third quarter of 2020. We are also planning to launch Predator in an additional six EMEA markets later in 2020, Bosnia, Croatia, Ghana, Romania, Russia and Slovenia. Currently innovation launches for all EMEA markets for the third and fourth quarters remain on track, despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, these launches will continue to be subject to developments in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic in individual countries. In Japan, we continued with the strong rollout of Pipeline Punch to 90% of the country, and in June launched Ultra Paradise with solid consumer acceptance. With strong innovation and continued growth of our core, we have further bolt-on our number one country share position in value. In South Korea, Monster Energy retained its Number 1 share position in value and in June began shipments for the summer 2020 launch of Ultra Paradise. In April 2020, we began distribution of our new Monster Energy Dragon tea in China, which is non-carbonated. Early feedback from consumers has been positive. During this quarter we began shipments for our summer on pack promotion and we expect to further build momentum with consumers in the retail trade. India remains mostly in national lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which took effect on March 25 2020. We have prepared a strong summer on pack promotion, which will help reestablish momentum as the market aims to reopen in the third quarter of 2020. During the 2020 second quarter, we purchased approximately 0.3 million shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of 52.88 per share, for a total amount of 15.6 million excluding broker commissions. As of August 4, 2020, approximately 441.5 million remained available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase program. We estimate July 2020 gross sales to be approximately 15.8% higher than in July 2019. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, July 2020, gross sales would have been approximately 17.1% higher than comparable July 2019 gross sales. July 2020 had the same number of selling days as July 2019. In this regard, we cautioned again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers, as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they also unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic remains a serious concern. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related and unfavorable economic conditions continue to intensify, the negative impact on ourselves including our new product innovation launches could be prolonged and may become more severe. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. One, the company's priority has been and remains the health and safety of our employees. Two, currently the company's flavor manufacturing facility, its co-packers, warehouses and shipping facilities and bottlers and distributors are all operating. Three, we are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio. Four, we're encouraged by the prospects for our Reign Total Body Fuel high performance energy drinks and Reign Inferno thermogenic fuel high performance energy drinks. We are planning for future launches of our Reign Total Body Fuel high performance energy drinks in certain countries outside of the US. Five, we are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury and our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans for future launches of our affordable energy brands outside of the United States. Six, despite the obstacles of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are pleased with our performance for the quarter and for the first half of the year. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Andrea Teixeira: Congrats on the results. So I remember you spoke to potentially answer the alcoholic segment, the last time we were there at your headquarters in June last year. And since then, we have heard you're planning to launch a Hard Seltzer. So I understand that you have postponed some of these launches. So the question is, if you are indeed looking to launch a Hard Seltzer and then if so, when are you hoping to be able to share more news with us. Thank you.
Rodney Sacks: Andrea, I think the issue is -- there's been a lot of speculation about what we are going to do both in the non-alcoholic and alcoholic spaces. We are looking at a number of alternatives and opportunities. And we may well do something in both of those spaces and/or one or the other. But we've not had made any final decisions. We are actually, you analyzing it, we were looking at developing some products in both non-alcoholic and alcoholic spaces, we are testing products. But we haven't yet decided on which of those we're going to go into. We have for example, I know that some of the analysts have picked up that we register different names of products, some of those names may be appropriate for one or more of these lines or may not be we are looking obviously as part of our planning, we are looking at availability of names that we think may be appropriate for lines or line extensions outside of the energy category. And in some cases, some of those names may well be used by us for an alternative brand within the energy space. I mean, it's a very broad spectrum that we are currently investigating. We've got the right to do quite a lot. We are looking at how do we do it? What's best, what do we think will have the most impact for the company in the short-term, both in the U.S. and as well as internationally? So, there's been a lot of speculation, and we are definitely looking at it and evaluating it, but we've not made any decision. So at this point, it is premature for us to give any indication to the market of what our plans are because we have not firmed up our plans internally ourselves yet. There's been no definitive decision on when to launch, what to launch and under what brand names. Obviously, we're getting there. We're quite close, but we haven't gotten to that position, yet. So I really can't give you an update other than to tell you that we are seriously looking at all those options. As we, as I said, there's a lot of speculation about what we're going to do because of the names and the trademarks we've applied to register under different clauses, but that is something that we are currently evaluating.
Hilton Schlosberg: So Andrea, the only thing I would add to that is that we have a very strong innovation pipeline with our existing business. So whatever we do, in addition to that, please rest assured that the company has a very interesting and very strong innovation pipeline.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Nik Modi: So I guess kind of one and a half question. One question is on innovation. Just given how the resets have been kind of thrown off [indiscernible] and just inactive now cancelled. I'm just curious on how you're thinking about communicating new product ideas and how you think that flow will work as we kind of work into the fall and into the spring of next year. So that's just kind of some general perspective. The real question is on CBD, what's the company's stance right now on that? I mean, is it -- you don't have enough clarity, so really don't want to enter that category? Or do you feel more comfortable now? I mean just any perspective around that would be helpful.
Hilton Schlosberg: Okay. So on the first question, we have a sales organization who in the U.S. call on every single major customer and that's how we go about presenting new product ideas on a one-to-one basis. So rest assured that innovation can be handled within the framework of our existing organization. Outside in particular, in Europe and in other parts of the world, the Coca-Cola bottle is present to customers with our attendance and they're very capable and they do display new products and new product innovations. On your second point, the environment is actually not clear as to where we are and where we should be with CBD. So at this time, we have products in development, but it's something that we're looking at from the sidelines and if things clear up and the opportunities that will present themselves that's something that we definitely will look at going forward, but not right now.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Peter Galbo of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Peter Galbo: Just wanted to ask you on the July sales increase, Rodney, you mentioned that bottlers had taken down inventory pretty low in the second quarter just, how should we look at that July increase, I guess from an organic demand, improvement standpoint versus bottlers maybe refilling some of the pipeline after getting inventory down to low? Thanks.
Rodney Sacks: I don't think we've really had a good read yet on where the bottlers -- when they're going to sort of get their inventory levels back to previous or pre-COVID levels. If they do, I mean, people are obviously looking at managing their inventory levels as tightly as they can and by taking things down. They may end up being a little more aggressive; obviously, we would like them to take some inventory levels up so that they just have more ability to react in the market and because of the lead time reasons. I don't think that we've seen a major restocking in July. We've just, again, I think people are still cautious and they're trying to manage inventories and in some cases, they're trying to manage or reduce some of the focus on -- better way to put it on their main SKUs. And so some of the smaller SKUs have perhaps suffered a little bit as well during this period, but we think those things will get back to normalizing. But I don't believe we've seen a substantial jump back in inventory levels in July. I think that sort of reasonably normal trading for us and Hilton, if you'd like to add something on that.
Hilton Schlosberg: Yes. What I'd like to add is that, depletions are tracking positive through July. So sales that are bottlers make to retailers are tracking positively and sure there will come a time when bottlers will revert to the prior inventories. But remember, they look at for us. Some bottlers have cash issues, the bigger bottlers look at sales forecasts that are generated both by their own forecasts and by the computer forecasting models. So they order inventories in accordance with those models. So, you remember when we spoke about on the last call, we spoke -- April was down. And we had a long and a robust discussion about that and we spoke about the patients. And looking at this quarter, we've had a strong July, which is consistent with what's happened in the sequential improvement through May. So April, we had that dip that we spoke about on our call. And in May and June, we've had a sequential improvement and we've seen that sequential improvement through July as well.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Mark Astrachan: I guess I'm curious on U.S. I don't know how to diplomatically ask the question but maybe, if you could touch on the engagement of the coke system both in terms of selling your legacy product and the new product innovation including the shelf space for those obviously it was a little bit of a slower start. And we've seen Red Bull do very well. So maybe just touch on kind of where we are with reengagement both in legacy as well as innovation and how you think that should play out if things get back from blocking and tackling standpoint, if the share trends potentially improve and you kind of how you think about that?
Hilton Schlosberg: So Mark, remember we coming out of 100-year pandemic. And there's been -- the bottlers have all been operating and in some cases, the bottlers have been focused on sending the faster sending items, I think Rodney mentioned that earlier in the call. And they did not focus on the innovation and the SKUs that not move as fast as the faster sending items. So, we've seen that. We've seen some of the bottlers being affected by the employees by COVID; our people remember who are out of the field until the last month so they now are back in the field with the appropriate safety protocols. And our people are working; our field people are working with the bottlers and the retailers to restore the innovation that had not been taken place. So, Red Bull, it's interesting -- we've been watching the growth of Red Bull as well. And, once it's paying, you've seen the numbers and we've spoken about the numbers today. I've heard about the numbers in Nielsen. We are growing much faster than Red Bull in for example, Amazon. They have their own sales force and the distribution network. They've been able to execute pretty well in the trade they had a really good innovation the CEO called watermelon, which is pretty popular. So, in balance I think they probably distributed us in terms of displays and other points of purchase on store shelves and on the floors of the stores. And that's something that we are working to pretty aggressively without fuel people back in the stores to regain. So that's my kind of summary on where we are and the issue with Red Bull.
Rodney Sacks: Perhaps I could just, again also just have a little bit of color too, because I think it's obviously, you're focused on it and some people have been seeing the numbers. I think it comes down to during this period of time; Red Bull really managed their own distribution system. And they have dedicated and very focused personnel. I think when most of the big companies took a step back, particularly with their personnel in the field and their core points and being active in the market in the smaller markets, convenience and gas, et cetera and independent. I think all the bigger companies took their foot off the pedal and looked at protecting their employees and trying to handle the situation. I'll believe is that Red Bull literally was probably the only company that didn't do that and actually had their teams in the field, merchandising and promoting. And when you combine that focus together and they adjust their approach to the COVID pandemic, as well as together with the fact that they did have a flavor that resonated and it was really well executed the introduction of it, and it has really given them that boost. That's really what we think has been the real difference. But those are things that with a bigger company, like the Coke system where I think they just step back as most other consumer product companies did. I think that will start reversing and that they are getting back into the field. Now we're getting out into the field. We also pulled some of our team out as Hilton said. We've got a really understand that and that's what I think has been one of the big reasons. We've got some innovation lined up for the second half of this year, including something in response to the watermelon product and we will be launching that within the next few weeks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
Laurent Grandet: So last time we spoke I mean, you mentioned that because of COVID-19, I mean retailers and specifically I mean the convenience store retailers then reset for most part I mean [indiscernible] for the summer. There was a clear focus for you; I mean to make sure that you were able to implement your new innovation. So just curious, I mean, in all your retailers and the convenience store retailers, I mean, are they all reset them in their shelves? And did you gain shelf space for the energy category or the performance energy, and/or either I mean any additional retailers that need to convert to a larger shelf. I know it's late in the summer but because of COVID-19 I mean, there was some delays. So want to have you taken these. Thanks.
Hilton Schlosberg: A lot of the retailers are merchandised by the bottlers. So even though the space was allocated, they may not have got to merchandise the product at the start of the resets. So where we're at now, as I mentioned, learn that guys are back in the field. And they're working with the bottlers to ensure that all of our innovation get the space that has been contractually allocated and just getting away from where we were in the early part of the pandemic where -- it was hands off. And if you look at how the convenience channel has grown and is continuing to grow, I think it's a far cry from where we were in March and April when all of this started.
Rodney Sacks: But that being said, I think that, it really is a work in progress. I don't think we've got to a point where we could say that it's all -- everything that was planned is back in line and everything was achieved. I think it's because it's out of cycle and because of the difficulties just still being faced, generally. It is a slower effort, it's being done, it's slow, but it is improving all the time. But I think it's still not where we would like to see it. But hopefully we will continue to improve as we go through the next few months.
Hilton Schlosberg: Yes. Sets are done for the most part, but it's the distribution actual physical distribution of the products on the sets on the shelves that our field teams are working on.
Operator: And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks for his final remarks.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. And in particular, expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottler system internationally. We believe that we will be able to navigate through the challenges ahead as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and hope that this unfortunate situation will resolve itself in the not too distant future. We believe that we are well positioned in the energy drink category and continue to be optimistic about our total portfolio of energy drink brands. We hope that you will stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: Thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-08 17:00:00) =====

Please note this event is being recorded.I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead.
Rodney Sacks: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I am Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President is on the call as is Tom Kelly, our Executive Vice President of Finance. Tom Kelly will now read our cautionary statement.

A copy of this information is also available on our Web site, www.monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section.I would now like to hand the call over the call over to Rodney Sacks.
Rodney Sacks: Let me begin by stating that our thoughts and prayers are with all who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has affected the health of so many individuals around the globe, including some of our team members. This includes myself. In mid-March, I began to experience flu like symptoms, tested positive for COVID-19 and thankfully made a good recovery. I'm feeling good but for an occasional cough. For this, I'm very grateful. And we are fortunate that everyone at our company who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 is doing well and has been making good progress. The company has always operated with co-leaders. And I would like to thank Hilton and the leadership team for their leadership and support during this difficult period. To everyone at Monster, my sincere thanks and appreciation for all your efforts.From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, our top priority has been the health, safety and well being of our employees. Early in March 2020, we implemented global travel restrictions and work from home policies for employees who are able to work remotely. For those employees who are unable to work remotely, safety precautions have been instituted, which were developed and adopted in line with guidance from public health authorities and professional consultants. We are incredibly proud of the teamwork exhibited by our employees, co-packers and bottlers distributors around the world, who are ensuring the integrity of our supply chain. Our flavor manufacturing facilities, our co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities are all operating.Certain of our bottlers distributors have implemented modifications to their core points and service levels, but generally our products remain available to consumers. In limited countries, which are smaller markets for us, the operations of our bottlers and distributors have been more affected. Since March 2020, while various markets have faced governmental measures, restrictions and guidance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the sales and merchandising activities of certain of our bottlers and distributors have been modified.The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our net and gross sales for the 2020 first quarter was not material. The company's April sales were materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, bottler and distributor sales of the company's product to retail in the United States were markedly less adversely impacted. Since mid-March 2020, the company has seen a shift in consumer channel preferences and package configurations, including an increase in at home consumption and a decrease in immediate consumption.To-date, our sales in the second quarter have been adversely affected as a result of a decrease in foot traffic in the convenience and gas channel, which is our largest channel and food service on premise, while our e-commerce, club store, mass merchandise and grocery and related business remain stable. Currently, we do not foresee a material impact on the ability of our co-packers to manufacture and our bottlers and distributors to distribute our products as a result of COVID-19 pandemic.In addition, we are not experiencing raw material or finished product shortages in our supply chain. Monster Energy case our philanthropic arm is actively engaged in a number of philanthropic efforts, including donating products to individuals, working on the front lines, such as first responders, healthcare workers, hospitals and the National Guard. Based on currently available information, we do not expect the COVID-19 pandemic to have material impact on our liquidity. In the first quarter of 2020, net sales were $1.06 billion, up 12.3% from $946 million in the first quarter of 2019. Adjusting for foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2020 first quarter would have been up 13.4%.Operating income was $365 million, up from $311.5 million in the first quarter of 2019. The increase in net income was 6.6%. The lower percentage increase in net income was primarily due to our higher effective tax rate in the quarter compared to the same quarter in 2019, primarily attributable to a decrease in the equity compensation deduction. Diluted earnings per share for the 2020 first quarter increased 8.2% to $0.52 a share from $0.48 in the first quarter of 2019.According to Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through April 25, 2020, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandises, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, decreased by 1.2% versus the same period a year ago.

Celsius sales increased 75% and its share increased 1.5 share points to 3.7%.We're verified the Nielsen that the data for Mexico for the month of March 2020 did not fully capture all of Monster sales. As a result, the Nielsen data is inaccurate and will not be covered on this call. We will resume reporting Nielsen data for Mexico once its data has been corrected. According to Nielsen for the month of March 2020 compared to March 2019, Monsters' retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 23.7% to 37.1%, in Brazil from 19.2% to 25.7% and in Chile, from 35.9% to 41.4%. I'd like to point out the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country, and are reported on varying base within the month referred to from country to country.According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ended April 17, 2020, Monster’s retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 31.7% to 34.4% in Spain. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ended March 31, 2020, Monster’s retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 12% to 12.6% in the Czech Republic from 12.3% to 15.2% in Poland, from 19.4% and 23.8% in the Republic of Ireland and from 16.3% to 17.7% in South Africa.

According to INTAGE in Japan, Monster’s market share in value in the convenience store channel for the 13-week period ending March 2020, grew from 49.3% to 58.4% as compared to the same period in the previous year.During the latest four-week period ending March 2020, Monster’s share in Japan grew from 49.5% to 61.6% as compared to the same period in the previous year. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or four-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions and/or other trading factors during those periods.Net sales to customers outside the U.S., was 356.8 million, 33.6% of total net sales in the 2020 first quarter compared to 284.1 million, which is 30% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2019. Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately 10.4 million in the 2020 first quarter. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and trans-shipped to the military and their customers overseas.In EMEA, net sales in the first quarter increased 26.3% in dollars and increased 28.5% in local currencies over the same period in 2019. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 41.3% compared to 43.2% in the same quarter in 2019. Gross profit percentage for the region was impacted by country and product mix. We’re also plased that in the first quarter, Monster gained market share in the Czech Republic, France, Great Britain, Italy Norway, Poland, Republic of Ireland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden. In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the first quarter increased 32.8% in dollars and 33.7% in local currencies over the same period in 2019.Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sale was 42% versus 42.2% over the same period in 2019, as a result of country and product mix. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 61.7% in dollars and 60.1% in local currency. In South Korea, net sales increased 40.6% in dollars and 48% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2019.

Sales of the Monster brand increased 18.5% in dollars and 24.3% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2019.In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the first quarter increased 29.1% in dollars and 45.7% in local currencies over the same period in 2019. Gross profit in this region, as a percentage of net sales, was 42.5% compared to 43.6% over the same period in 2019. In Brazil, net sales in the quarter increased by 114.7% in dollars and increased 138.1% in local currency. Net sales in Chile, decreased 16.8% in dollars and 3.2% in local currency in the quarter. This was due to timing of shipments and our retail market share depletions remained strong.In the 2020 first quarter, we transitioned to Trinidad and Tobago to the Coca Cola bottler. In addition, we began production with our bottler in Trinidad, which will allow us to supply other islands and countries in this region on a tax efficient basis. In January 2020, Monster Energy was launched by the Coca Cola bottler in Israel.I will now briefly discuss our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals Inc, VPX the maker of Bang Energy drinks. A number of proceedings are currently ongoing to adjudicate claims, including claims for false advertising and trademark infringement, brought by the company against VPX and by VPX against the company. These proceedings are ongoing. Our only update since our last earnings call is in relation to the lawsuit against VPX over its intention to launch its own line of Reign branded energy drinks in 16 ounce cans to be sold in convenience stores.On May 1, 2020, a district court judge granted a preliminary injunction in joining the VPX from using the Reign mark in connection with any ready to drink beverage. A motion for summary judgment has been filed by Monster in this proceeding against all of VPX's claims in the suit, with a hearing on that motion set for later in May this year. In the event that summary judgment is not granted against all claims in the suit, the matter is scheduled for trial in August 2020. As with litigation and other pending proceedings with VPX are subjudicate, we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today's call.We are working closely with our China team to follow the rules implemented by local authorities and we have reopened office in China. Monster shipments and distribution in the first quarter in China were negatively affected by the lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This resulted in a volume decrease in the first quarter in China. But beginning in late March, early April, we have seen an increase in shipments and depletions.In April, we began distribution of our new Monster Energy Dragon Tea, which is non-carbonated and which has received early positive feedback. In addition, certain globally supplied ingredients are sourced from third party manufacturers in Wuhan and other parts of China have recommended shipping to our network of copackers. During the 2020 first quarter in the United States, we launched a number of new exciting products, including a line of Reign Inferno, Thermogenic Fuel, two new energy drinks in the Monster Ultraline, a line of Java Monster 300 and a line of Monster Hydro Super Sport, as well as NOS Turbo.These launches were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we did not achieve planned distribution levels, in part due to certain retailers postponing implementation of their new plan schematics, which included our innovation products. We are developing plans with our bottlers and distributors to re-prioritize these recent innovation launches to ensure that we are able to maximize their distribution as soon as normalcy returns, particularly to the convenience and gas channel.In Canada, our Monster Energy portfolio was extended in January 2020 with the launch of Monster Ultra Paradise, Java Monster Swiss Chocolate, Monster Hydra Blue Ice, Monster Dragon Green Tea and Yerba Mate. We also added an additional flavor to our NOS energy lineup with NOS Sonic Sour.In Mexico, we launched Predator as our first entry in the country in the value segment. And in Brazil, we launched our non-carbonated Monster Energy Dragon Tea lemon tea during March 2020. In Australia, we launched Monster Energy Neo nationally and rolled up Mother Epics roll nationally in January off an exclusive with the select convenience and guest chain launch in the fourth quarter of 2019.Juice Monster Pacific Punch was launched in Germany and the Netherlands in March 2020, and in France and Sweden in April 2020 and is now available in nine EMEA markets. And is planned to be launched into a further three markets in 2020. Black Monster Manga Logo was launched in Russia in March 2020. Manga Logo is now available in 34 EMEA markets. Juice Monster Pipeline Punch was launched in Iceland, Malta and Norway in February 2020 and the Baltics, Denmark and Hungary in March 2020, and is now available in 20 markets across EMEA.Monster Ultra Paradise was launched in Germany and the Netherlands in March and in Belgium, Italy and Norway in April and is now available in eight EMEA markets. We are planning to launch Ultra Paradise into further 14 markets in 2020 in EMEA. Espresso Monster was launched in Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece and Switzerland in March 2020, and in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in April 2020, in both milk and vanilla variants. Espresso Monster milk and vanilla variants are now available in 20 markets in EMEA.We are planning to launch two flavors of Espresso Monster into further two markets in 2020. Additionally, we launched Espresso Monster Salted Caramel in Norway in February 2020 and in Sweden in April 2020. We are planning to launch this product in the further three EMEA markets in 2020. Reign was launched in Germany in February 2020 and in Spain in April 2020. Additionally, we are planning to launch Reign into a further six markets in 2020.Once the HydroSport was launched in Norway and Sweden in February 2020, and we are planning to launch Monster HydroSport in Spain late in the second quarter. Burn Dark Energy, our new citrus burn variant was launched in Russia in March 2020. Two SKUs of the new Nalu Energy tea line, green tea and ginger and black tea and passionfruit, were launched in Belgium in April 2020.We launched Predator, our affordable energy brand in the Czech Republic and Hungry in February 2020, Afghanistan and North Macedonia in March 2020. Additionally, we are planning to launch Predator in Ethiopia, Ghana and Nigeria in the second quarter of 2020. We're also planning to launch predator into a further five EMEA markets later in 2020, Bosnia, Croatia, Romania, Russia and Slovenia.Similar to the United States in a number of markets, our recent new product launches were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we are implementing plans to re-prioritize certain launches. In Japan, we successful relaunched Pipeline Punch with strong results that builds our number one country share positioning value. In South Korea, we further expanded Pipeline Punch to 90% of convenience stores with positive results that also took Monster to a number one share position in value.The Monster portfolio grew strongly in both countries. We are planning to launch Ultra Paradise in both Japan and South Korea later this year. India followed up on the December 2019 Mango Loco launch and extended distribution nationally early in the first quarter before a national lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which took effect on March 25, 2020. We estimate April 2020 gross sales to be approximately 22.2% lower than in April 2019. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, April 2020 gross sales would have been approximately 20.8% lower than comparable April 2019 gross sales. However, bottler and distributor sales of the company's products to retail in the United States were markedly less adversely impacted.April 2020 has the same number of selling days as April 2019. April sales were materially and adversely impacted by the COVID pandemic to deferring degrees from country to country. We're optimistic for improvement once the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. Indeed, a number of U. S. states have recently begun to partially reopen and certain countries internationally are starting to do likewise. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers, as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they also unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales average for periods, such as a single month or even two months, should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points; one, the company's priority has been and remains the health and safety of our employees, customers, consumers and our communities; two, currently the company's flavor manufacturing facilities, its copackers, warehouses and shipping facilities and bottlers and distributors are all operating; three, we are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio; four, we are encouraged by the prospects for our Reign Total Body Fuel high performance energy drinks and Reign Inferno thermogenic fuel high performance energy drinks, not only within the U.S. but also internationally; five we are pleased with our growth and performance, both domestically and internationally during the first quarter. We reiterate the growth potential for us in India when the country reopens as well as in China; six, we are proceeding with planning for future launches of our affordable energy brands, as well as Reign Total Body Fuel high performance energy drinks in certain countries outside of the U.S.; seven this year in light of the public health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we will conduct our annual meeting on June 3, 2020 exclusively as a virtual meeting via live webcast.You will not be able to attend the annual meeting in person but during the virtual meeting, you may ask questions and we'll be able to vote your shares electronically. Additional information regarding attending the annual meeting, voting your shares and submitting questions, can be found in the company's proxy statement. I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you and good afternoon, everybody. And Rodney, I'm glad to hear you’re well and wish you good health to all on this call. So how much has traditional channels and convenience and gas impacted the 20.8% FX neutral decline globally in April? And if we can break down the U.S., I guess we’ll appreciate the figure you gave, saying that U.S. was largely impacted. It will be helpful for investors to figure out when the timing of COVID passes. And then the other thing I would like to clarify on the e-commerce performance. How much -- you gave and we appreciate that. How much would that represent now as a percentage of total sales? Thank you very much.
Rodney Sacks: Okay, Andrea, good afternoon. Maybe I should deal with that question. So what we saw in April was a decline in sales, which we indicated. If you look at the Nielsen for all major channels, we on these calls traditionally give the Nielsen for convenience. But if you look at the Nielsen for all major channels that show the decline of 10.2%. Not only do we measure shipments, we also measure depletions. And depletions are the sales that the bottlers and distributors sell to the various retailers.Depletion were largely in line with the Nielsen numbers for all major channels. In fact, they were a little bit better. So I think what you’ve seen and I'm only talking to U.S. and I'll talk about EMEA, which is our next biggest market in a while. So in the U.S., what we saw was, I believe and the numbers appear to verify that there was a reduction in inventories in the bottler network, because shipments declined much faster than depletions and in fact the Nielsen numbers. So that's where we are in the U.S. with our bottler and distributor business.With our direct business, we have some direct business, the clubs, e-commerce, et cetera that business was largely intact. So we didn't see declines in that part of the business. Also, what happened in April is that there was a lot of stock building and pantry loading that seem to culminate in the last week in March. And in April and if you look at April sales week by week, our sales have improved week by week. And that's also true in EMEA, which is our next biggest market. So in EMEA, they didn't see the same degree of stock reduction by the bottles distributors. But what we have seen in the EMEA, as the countries have opened sequentially better performance week on week.For the rest of business, Asia Pacific was up on last year marginally and LATAM -- well, I should say margin was actually it was up to a nice degree over last year and LATAM was in line with last year. So that's the issue from the U.S. and from EMEA, and I hope that answered your question.So regarding the second question and you kind of not -- out one question, but on the second question about e-commerce. We don't disclose those numbers. The numbers are available on stat line. We don't disclose those numbers. The debt market is becoming a very big market for us. And you could see from the indication on the call that our market share with Amazon is growing pretty significantly.
Operator: And our next question will come from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Mark Astrachan: Hey, afternoon, everybody. First of all, by the way, I'm making dinner for the kids while listening. So you guys are very fortunate. I guess I just wanted to talk a bit about some of the cost controls that seem to have occurred in the quarter. Maybe talk a bit about how to think about selling and G&A expenses. In terms of with some of shift response to what you've seen in the quarter and some of this because you didn't have NASCAR recurring and selling expenses, while G&A up a little bit less than we've seen. And I know you don't want to give guidance, but any sort of direction that you can give us in terms of how to think about those numbers for 2020 that would be helpful. Thanks.
Rodney Sacks: So as we look at the year, particularly with sponsorships and endorsement. Yes, NASCAR has fallen away and we have other sponsorships and endorsements that may not cost the same this year as they did last year, because a number of events have been canceled. So we don't give guidance. But I think as one reflects on the year, we can see a change in pattern in our spending. We've been spending a lot more on social media, which we believe is very important, particularly in this market that we're in. And we'll continue to spend in the markets as we deem appropriate.
Operator: Our next question will come from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Peter Galbo: I guess Rodney, as you mentioned, some of the states are starting to reopen. What have you seen kind of from the core Monster consumer in a more restrictive states in New York or California where we're expecting kind of manufacturing and construction to come back online sooner. That I would think will also kind of play more in your core consumer. Just anything you're hearing on the ground as they start to reopen more. Thanks.
Rodney Sacks: I think that that's drilling down to a level that I don't think is appropriate. And I don't think it's something we should be doing, because there are so many variances from state to state and so many factors. I think you've got to look at it on a broader basis across the U.S. and also across the world, because you look at individual countries. And we're really not in a position to have analyse each and every country and giving you percentage up or the percentage back to normal. I think it's just more anecdotal of a trend that we are seeing, and it's starting to open. And we just say, we feel that when you look at the weekly numbers, Hilton referred to earlier, you can see that there seems to be a trend that those numbers are improving on a weekly basis.
Operator: Thank you. Next question will come from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
Laurent Grandet: Good morning, everyone. And Rodney I’m very glad to hear that you’re recovering from COVID, so keep safe. So, I like to question you about the renewed competition in the space. And Pepsico in the quarter became a much stronger competitor with, first the acquisition of Rockstar, and that's with the announcement of distribution agreements with them in the U.S. Any comments on the move and how you are planning to adjust maybe to this new landscape. And also mean, should that change the way you and the Coca-Cola company and its populous partner? Thank you.
Rodney Sacks: Well, I think it's difficult to comment on Coca Cola, because we've always maintained a good relationship with the Coca-Cola company even during the arbitration proceedings that we had. We know that transitions generally are very disruptive. We've been through a number and we know how disruptive they can be. So that's we believe in a short term is an opportunity for us. In the long term, it's difficult to comment, because Pepsi Cola has never really had success in the energy category historically, although, they now have brands that are a lot more powerful than they had before.Rockstar has declined 50% since the market share, since the distribution agreement began in 2009. So it's really difficult to say. I think that the short term will be disruptive and we've got plans, both for the short term and for the long term. And I think it will be inappropriate for us to disclose what those plans are. But rest assured we do have plans and we believe we've got very strong brands and that we’ve got good marketing prowess and that that advantage will prevail in the long term.
Operator: Our next question will come from Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Bill Chappell: Just following up on the -- and glad to hear you're doing well Rodney. Just following up on the Pepsi side, less from what you were seeing, be it from Rockstar or Bang, because I think you've kind of already seen that. Are you expecting anything new out of Mountain Dew or seeing anything from that front? Now that it seems that Pepsi is a little more unleashed and what it can do on the energy sector?
Hilton Schlosberg: Well, we haven't seen anything yet. But we are anticipating that yes, that reporting in the press that they were kind of hamstrung with utilizing the word energy on some of the other brands. And we believe that that’s something that will happen in time but honestly, we shouldn't conjecture on what they may or may not do.
Rodney Sacks: Yes, I’d just like to add that a lot of these things are not new. They have endeavour to play in that space through Kickstart and in the Mountain Dew range, and -- as an extension. And so there will be a little bit of a divergence, tweak to that. They have already been building on what Hilton said, they've been distributing Rockstar for the last 10 years. So at the end of the day, I don't think there's going to be much change. But again, we can't speculate to whatever they will put behind and for how long. But we do think that the Rockstar brand has some challenges, and we think that we're in a strong position to address that. And to address the the Bang position, I think that you've seen the market shares of Bang over the past 12 months. And we think we're in a good position to continue to compete with them, regardless of the distribution system change. There are benefits but there are also some negatives in that that come with that change.
Hilton Schlosberg: So the one thing I would add, actually, to what we've all just said, is that this results with Pepsico, I think will galvanize us, Coca-Cola and a whole bottling system against the common enemy. And I think that's a very positive factor as well.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks and Mr. Hilton Schlosberg.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I would like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy, and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company, both at home and abroad and in particular, expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally.We believe that we will be able to navigate through the challenges ahead as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. And hope that this unfortunate situation will resolve itself in the not too distant future. We believe that we are well positioned in the energy drink category and continue to be optimistic about our total portfolio of energy drink brands. We hope that you will stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: And thank you, sir. The conference has not concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-28 17:00:00) =====

With that in mind, we will not repeat many of the numbers covered in our earnings release.Consumer Beverage preferences and tastes continue to evolve at an increasing pace and we are endeavoring to address them through our ongoing innovation of new products. In the fourth quarter of 2019 net sales were at $1.02 billion, up 10.1% from $924.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, adjusting the 2018 fourth quarter for advanced purchases made following our November 1, 2018 cost increase in the U.S., as well as foreign currency movements.

Coca-Cola energy market share was 3.5% in the month of December 2019.The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that maybe undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.According to Nielsen, for the month of December 2019 compared to December 2018, Monster’s regional market share in value increased in Argentina from 16.9% to 33.5%; in Brazil from 19.6% to 27.4%, and in Chile from 34.9% to 39.8%.I’d like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country-to-country.According to Nielsen, in the 13 week period ended January 55, 2020, Monster’s retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 12.7% to 12.8% in Belgium, from 24.8% to 28.2% in France, from 16.4% to 17% in Germany, from 20.3% to 21.9% in Great Britain, from 17.8% to 24.9% in Norway, from 31.7% to 34.5% in Spain, but declined from 7.3% to 6.1% in Netherlands and from 13.8% to 12.8% in Sweden.According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended in December 2019, Monster’s retail market share and value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 13.3% to 13.6% in the Czech Republic, from 33.6% to 34.7% in Greece, from 18.8% to 23% in the Republic of Ireland, from 18.1% to 20.6% in Italy, and from 10.9% to 14.5% in Poland and from 15.8% to 17.4% in South Africa.According to IRI in Australia, Monster’s market share in value for the four weeks ended December 29, 2019, increased from 7.5% to 9.3% as compared to the same period the previous year.

We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or four-week period may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods.Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $319.6 million, 31.4% of total net sales in the 2019 fourth quarter compared with $274.3 million or 29.7% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2018. Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $9.1 million.Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company’s military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and trans-shipped to the military and their customers overseas.In EMEA supply chain and production issues have largely been resolved. In EMEA net sales in the fourth quarter increased 8.6% in dollars and it increased 12.8% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 38.7%, compared to 42.1% in the same quarter in 2018. Gross profit percentage for the region was impacted by country and product mix.We are also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gain market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, Norway, Poland, Republic of Island, South Africa and Spain.In Asia-Pacific net sales in the fourth quarter increased 49.9% in dollars and 47.9% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 40.2% versus 46.1% over the same period in 2018 as a result of country and product mix.In Japan net sales in the quarter increased 84.2% in dollars and 76.8% in local currency.

Although I would like to point out that sales of the Monster brand increased 18.4% in dollars and 24.5% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2018.In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 6.9% in dollars and 16.2% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 42.6% compared to 44.7% over the same period in 2018.In Brazil, net sales in the quarter increased by 35.8% in dollars and increased 44% in local currency. Net sales in Chile decrease 14.8% in dollars and 7.6% in local current in the quarter.In January 2020 Monster Energy was launched by the Coco-Cola bottler in Israel. We continued the rollout of Monster across India and began the launch of Mango Loco in December. We also continued Ultra Violet’s expansion from Septembers launch to further provide a broad portfolio with strong taste experiences for Indian consumers.The Monster range continues to build significant active distribution increases across China in the 2019 fourth quarter versus a year ago, but the situation in China is currently challenging. I wanted to provide an updated regarding the recent coronavirus or COVID-19 outbreak.First of all, our number one priority is the safety of our employees in China. We are thinking of everyone who has been affected by coronavirus and we continue to monitor the situation closely. In addition to having employees in China, we and our suppliers currently globally source certain ingredients from third party manufacturers in Wuhan and other parts of China. We also manufacture finished goods through third party bottlers and co-packers in China.The coronavirus outbreak could adversely affect our business and cause disruptions internationally due to the closure or suspension of activities at such third party manufacturers, as well as within China at our co-packing facilities and our china office. Ingredient sourcing delay could also interfere with, and would delay production of certain of our products internationally.In addition, the outbreak tougher with the accompanying special government measures could adversely affect the growth of our business in China and affect demand for our products. However, it's too early to determine what impact it will have on our global supply chain and our operations. As I said before, our first priority is employee safety and we are continuing to monitor the situation closely.I will now briefly discuss our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals Inc., VPX, the maker of Bang energy drinks. Monster filed a lawsuit against VPX in September 2018 for false advertising. VPX filed a trademark lawsuit in March 2019 against Monster in relation to our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks and another lawsuit in August 2019 against Monster alleging a host of legal challenges, including many similar to the claims Monster alleged against VPX. These proceeding are ongoing.In October 2019, the U.S. District Court denied VPX’s motion for a preliminary injunction against our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in its trademark lawsuit. In his decision, the Court ruled that VPX failed to meet any of the elements of a preliminary injunction and failed to establish that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its claims.In October 2019 VPX announced its intention to launch its own line of Reign branded energy drinks in 16 ounce cans to be sold in convenience stores. Later that month we filed an expedited motion for a preliminary injunction asking the court to stop this product launch and to prevent VPX from infringing Monster’s trademark rights in this way.In November 2019 VPX stipulated that it would refrain from launching such products until the District Judge entered the final order on the preliminary injunction motion. In January 2020 the Magistrate Judge issued a report in recommendation that an injunction be drawn in Monster favor. Motions for some rejudgment had been filled by Monster in this proceeding and which are currently pending.In the event that some rejudgment is not granted, the matter is rescheduled for trial in May 2020. As our litigation and other pending proceedings with VPX are subjugated, we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today’s call.In October we launched Java Monster Farmers Oats, which contains Oatmilk is our first plant based coffee product being non-dairy and vegan, as well as two new flavors in the Reign brand family, Strawberry Sublime and Mango Magic to supplement out Reign Orange Creamsicle line extension which was launched at the end of the third quarter. During the fourth quarter 2019 we also extended Ultra Paradise, Reign Melon Mania and Reign Razzle Berry in multipacks.In 2020 in the United States we will be discontinuing our Cafe Monster line of products and repositioning our Espresso Monster line. We launched Reign Inferno™ thermogenic fuel in Jalapeno Strawberry, Red Dragon and True Blue at the end of January 2020.We launched Mango Loco in Argentina during the fourth quarter of 2019. In Porto Rico in January 2020 we launched Reign Strawberry Sublime and Mango Magic, as well as Muscle Monster, vanilla and chocolate.We launched Monster Energy, Monster Energy Absolutely Zero and Monster Energy Valentino Rossi in Israel in January 2020. Monster Pacific Punch was launched in Belgium, Great Britain, Northern Island, the Republic of Ireland in January 2020 and is planned to be launched in to a further seven markets in 2020.Monster Pipeline Punch will be launched in the Baltics in Norway this year and will then be available in 17 markets across EMEA. Monster Ultra Paradise was launched in Great Britain, Northern Island and the Republic of Island in January in 2020 and in Sweden in February in 2020 and is planned to be launched into a further 18 markets throughout 2020.Espresso Monster was launched in Belgium, the Republic of Island and Poland in the fourth quarter of 2019, in both milk and Vanilla variance. We also launched both variances in the Baltics, the Netherland and Portugal in January 2020 and in Austria in February 2020. Espresso Monster Milk and Vanilla variance are now available in 14 markets in the EMEA. We are planning to rollout two flavors of Espresso Monster in a further nine markets throughout 2020.Additionally, we have launched Espresso Monster Salted Caramel in Germany and Great Britain in December 2019. We are planning to rollout out Salted Caramel Espresso variance in the further five EMEA markets throughout 2020.Reign was launched in Great Britain, Northern Island and the Republic of Island in the fourth quarter of 2019, and we are planning to launch Reign in Germany by the end of the first quarter of 2020. Additionally, we are planning to launch into a further seven markets throughout 2020.Monster HydroSport was launched to Germany, Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in the fourth quarter of 2019 any in France in January 2020. We are planning to launch HydroSport in Norway and Sweden by the end of the first quarter of 2020.We launched Predator, our affordable energy brand in Kenya and Uganda in the fourth quarter of 2019. Additionally we launched Predator in Poland in January 2020 and are planning to launch Predator in Afghanistan, Czech Republic, Ghana and Hungary in the first quarter of 2020.We are also planning to launch Predator into a further 11 EMEA markets throughout 2020; Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia, Croatia, Ethiopia, Iraq, Russia, Slovenia, Nigeria, the Netherlands and the UAE.We launched Mother Epic Swell in Australia during the fourth quarter of 2019, with a convenience customer before a national launch in January 2020. Monster Mule also launched in Australia in January 2020.In South Korea we further expanded Pipeline Punch to 90% of convenience stores with initial positive results. We launched Mango Loco in India during December and completed the Ultra White rolled out in India, Vietnam and Malaysia during the 2019 fourth quarter.We are planning to launch a number of products in Asia Pacific over the upcoming months, including a full country relaunch of Pipeline Punch in Japan in March 2020, and the Ultra Paradise in South Korea and Japan later this year.We estimate January 2020 gross sales to be approximately 15.3% higher than in January 2019. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, January 2020 gross sales would have been approximately 15.7% higher than comparable January 2019 gross sales. January 2020 had the same number of selling days than in January 2019.In this regard we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as for example selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers, as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even two months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Retail sales statistics for many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally going ahead of the category in line with the earlier periods.New additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company’s sales. We are excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches this year, as well as our innovation pipeline in 2020.We are encouraged by the prospects for our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks, and Reign Inferno™ thermogenic fuel high performance energy drinks, not only within the U.S., but also internationally.We are pleased with our growth and performance in our international markets. Net sales in the fourth quarter in EMEA increased 12.8% in local currency, in Asia Pacific increased 47.9% in local currency and in Latin America and the Caribbean increased 16.2% in local currency.We reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. We are proceeding with our plans for future launches of our affordable energy brands internationally. We are also proceeding with our plans for the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel, high performance energy drinks in certain countries outside of the USA.I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Dara Mohsenian: Hey guys.
Rodney Sacks: Hi Dara.
Hilton Schlosberg: Hey Dara.
Dara Mohsenian: Gross margins returned to year-over-year expansion in the quarter after fairly significant compression, generally in the last couple of years. So can you just tell us some of the key factors that drove that sequential year-over-year improvement in Q4, and if you think those factors are more sustainable as we look to 2020?And then just on the U.S. front, can you discuss your shelf space outlook, particularly with the Coke Energy launch and if you think you've seen any market impact from the Coke Energy launch so far. Thanks.
Hilton Schlosberg: So maybe I can address the gross profit issues that you referred to. So if you look at worldwide, what the positive effect is worldwide – well obviously the price increase in U.S. and Canada and then product mix, particularly with Reign, which is an alternative gross margin for some of our juice and coffee products. We also had benefits in [Inaudible] because we were manufacturing our Java Monsters domestically and we weren’t importing from the U.S. and aluminum and other raw materials were a positive factor, so that was the positives.Against that, we continued to have and you’ll see the gross margins that we referred to on this call. Against that, you'll continually see a change in the strategic brands versus the Monster products and the strategic brands, because they are concentrates and they have higher margins than the finished goods product, so that you'll continue to see that as an offset.You'll continue to see geographic mix as an issue, because obviously in the U.S. our margins are strong. They are less strong in other parts of the world for all the reasons we've spoken to in the past and you'll see the same trend with regard to product mix as we sell internationally, as we sell more juice products and more coffee products, they have a lower margin than the traditional Monster products and Reign products. So that's in a nutshell where we are with margin.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Andrea Teixeira: Hi, thank you for taking my question. If you can comment on how the allowances in particular in Reign Inferno and how incremental it has been to your quarter-to-date update. And as a follow-up to your Coronavirus commentary, obviously safety is the most important at this point, but what is your view on the monitoring California and overall changes in mobility? Have you seen any greater impact in convenience stores so far against other channels? Thank you.
Rodney Sacks: Perhaps I’ll just take the – Inferno has been really well received. In the initial you know it's very new to tell, but the sales have been good. The line extensions that we introduced into the Reign line, including particular Orange Creamsicle have also been well received. So the numbers are looking really positive for Orange Creamsicle and the other new products, as well as Reign. So anecdotally we’ve had some good response, both to the concept of the thermogenic Inferno product, as well as to the actual flavors.
Hilton Schlosberg: So Adex [ph] , if you look at for example what's happening in China, we are seeing obviously significant foot traffic decreasing in the biggest stores and the convenience stores, they have an all suffering, but not to the same degree.So if you translate that back to California, we haven't seen any implications yet, but you know the whole idea of this situation in China is that they limit the number of shoppers in particular stores. So that's why you'll see you know reduced foot traffic in the bigger stores and more concentrated foot traffic in the convenience stores. But we haven't seen any implications of that at this time.And then you know, if I could just talk about the Coronavirus for one second, I've been asked and I haven’t really answered it, because I was waiting to answer it on the call and we don't normally give numbers, sales in various countries. But what I can tell you is that our sales in China in 2019 were less than 1% of our consolidated net sales for the company, so that puts a little bit in perspective, because there was a little bit of nervousness, but it's less than 1%.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Steve Powers: Yes, hey thanks. So Hilton, last month in New York your acknowledged substantial – I think – you think you framed those issues of focus as coke bottlers were taken on Coke Energy and bringing it to the market in the U.S. I guess just some update there on how you're feeling about those bottlers execution on your brand's now that we’re a couple of months into the year, but January numbers imply that you've had some good uptake of that innovation, but just any color around that and around the in-market execution that you're seeing would be great.And then just to give voice to a question Dara had asked, I think we might have lost sight of just any additional color on the cooler and shelf set redesigns as they are shaping up in the U.S. Are you getting the positioning that you thought you would? Is Coke Energy getting the position that you thought it would relative to yourselves and Red Bull and others, that too would be great? Thank you.
Hilton Schlosberg: Okay so, you know the situation without our bottlers is always going to be a challenge now and we know that and working with all of our bottlers and our field teams and our guards on the street are working very closely to ensure that we get the rock top of representation on shelves.The anecdotal information that I've seen is that Coca Cola Energy took off and unfortunately or fortunately there doesn't seem to be a very strong amount of repeat purchases. However, you know they will continue we believe to spend significant amounts of dollars on their products and what we have to do is what I'll probably said in New York and I’ll say it gain, we have to still stay true to our last and ensure that our products get the right representation is the store, and that we don't suffer the issues of shelf space that for example we experienced in Australia, and we alluded to this in our presentation as well. But the news of today is that Coca Cola Energy has been – in its current form has been discontinued from the two major retailers in Australia.
Hilton Schlosberg: If I could just perhaps just add a little bit on that, on color, we've looked at some of the schematics that have come out for this year. In the U.S., which is obviously the place Coke Energy has recently been launched and if you look at the schematics, for that plus obviously the performance energy products, by and large we are getting increased shelf price, both for our general products, as well as our Reign products and Inferno, including our innovation.And perhaps if you look back on ’19, some of the innovation that we introduced didn't quite get the real estate and distribution levels that we had hoped for and that probably you know was – affected us a little bit in the 2019 year, but if you look at the new products, we have a really robust pipeline of new products.We have you know new Reign product, Inferno; we've got Ultra Fiesta and Ultra Rosa in the Ultra line that are two really good products; we have NOS Turbo, which is sort of a performance energy product to help boost the NOS line; we've got our new Hydro Sport SKUs; we have a new Java 300 line which has a higher caffeine content to compete with the Starbucks triple shot and I’m looking at the SKU’s and we’re getting a lot of good listings for the innovation.So hopefully you know the execution of our bottlers and distribution partners this year, particularly on innovation will be better and we are getting extra innovative. In many cases we are getting the performance products on to an additional separate shelf. In some cases it's simply an expansion of and within the Energy set.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Kevin Grundy: Thanks, good evening guys.
Rodney Sacks: Good evening.
Kevin Grundy: Two very quick ones; first one for Hilton. The G&A in the quarter, this one 's a bit granular, but I think it needs to be asked and sort of explained. Some of the profit margin pressure in the quarter, so gross margin better, but G&A was quite a bit higher, even excluding the intellectual property claim. Can you talk a little bit about some of the drivers there and I know you don't like to guide, but should we expect sort of normalization on that line item looking out for the balance of the year.And then Hilton, just on the performance segment, understanding your comments are right in the shelf space reset, but can we get updated thoughts there. So Bang obviously made a lot of noise, but the market share on that product is down about a point sequentially from where it was around the time of the launch of Reign, and when we look at the combined market share of those two brands being Bang and Reign, it's kind of hanging around this 11% sort of area.So your updated thoughts on the outlook for performance for the balance of ‘20 and sort of beyond that; are we sort of at of place where this 11% market share is kind of the right number or you think it goes beyond that, and if so why? So thanks for all that guys.
Rodney Sacks: Okay, well that’s quite an amount. That’s about 24 questions in one. If we talk a little bit about G&A, I think we were satisfied with the G&A that was spent in the quarter. You know we were running off the NASCAR program and we have a big push into social media and that was one of the big factors that we kind of were duplicating, some of the social media costs in the quarter as we roll off the NASCAR program. So you won’t see that NASCAR program to the same degree in 2020.And then when I look at you know the rest of the G&A, payroll is obviously increasing higher than ordinarily we would like, but you know we’re running an international business today that’s growing and developing and you can see from the sales and the number of countries we’re in, that we have to support the organization.So quite apart from you know other small issues which all – not small issues, but other issues which we’ll pick up in the K, I don't want to go into them now. All I can tell you is that I think that apart from that litigation, which obviously we were very really unhappy about that it's you know the effect of doing business in the U.S. and I always tell everyone, I'm not a lawyer, but you know I listen to these juries and it’s like – you know it is what it is. But I'm satisfied that our G&A is under control.So sorry, the next question you asked was about the percentage of the performance energy products in the U.S. and where that… [Cross Talk] Yeah, sorry.
Kevin Grundy: Yeah, I’m sorry. It was just basically broadly outlook for performance segment, which of course has made a lot of noise in the past year or two, but Bang’s market share is now down about a point; Reign is 3, 3.5, it's in that range and when you look at the combined market share of those two brands, it's been sort of bouncing around this 11% sort of area. So where does that leave us? What’s your outlook for performance energy and what’s its role in the category going forward? Thank you guys?
Hilton Schlosberg: I think Rodney put up his hands. So I'm happy for him to take over.
Rodney Sacks: Alright, just looking at that section. I think this section, that’s you know again, we call it the performance section, but really it’s part of the energy category and it's really energy. It’s a question of whether we can call that additional space with retailers to look at it, correcting you know increased bias into the categories.And so I think that you all – we all see some increased buyers coming into the category, and the set is sort of starting to settle down now. You're getting space allocated to banks, space allocated to Reign including Inferno. We are seeing a little bit of space being allocated to some of the competitors. You've got Rockstar with their sort of line and they’ve come out with a thermogenic line as well and then you’ve Adrenaline Shoc and then some of the smaller guys who are trying to get space, but don’t have the distribution depth, CELSIUS and C4.But we think it is panning out. So it’s sort of starting to settle down. It may grow a little bit, but we certainly don’t know. We think that there is an appetite, there is an increased consumer base through the different type of products that we've introduced now for example though Inferno.But, we don't give as I said guidance, I think you know that, and we certainly don’t have a crystal ball. But we think that there is some positive growth that will be achieved in energy generally and I think that this subset of types of products within the energy category will grow a little bit.We are launching for example HydroSport and that again is sort of an advanced hydration, but it does have BCAAs and higher caffeine. So a lot of products like that, Turbo, are starting to play into this area. It’s just really dividing up the attributes that consumers are looking for. Some consumers are looking for higher caffeine or BCAs and we think that that will help the whole category grow, as well as these specific products within the category.
Rodney Sacks: Yeah, I can just add to that it Kevin. I'm a consumer of these products and I honestly believe the category is here to stay. But where it will go, I don't think anybody knows. I think the main thing is that we have a number of SKUs that are addressing the category. We have some new product innovation that's coming in terms of the flavors and we are pretty excited about that whole performance energy part of the energy category, but its one part; there is lots of other parts to it as well.
Kevin Grundy: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Mark Astrachan: Wow! That was a pronunciation. Hey guys, how are you?
Rodney Sacks: Alright and you?
Mark Astrachan: I am good, I'm good other than the stock market. So Hilton, I wanted to go back to gross margin, I know I seem to ask this question a lot on calls. But international in particular, I guess how should we think about that going forward? I’m not asking guidance, but I guess it seems like the pressure on the strategic brands is having an outsized impact on that number.So as you go to the back half of ’20, you start laughing at these low double digit declines that you had in 3Q and 4Q. You are obviously launching Predator now, I guess that’s not – you are launching Predator now, it’s a concentrate model, so that should help. How should we be thinking about kind of those moving parts, meaning as you lap easier comparisons you get the benefit from Predator. Should that help stabilize international gross margins? Can they move a little bit higher if Predator works in these markets. And maybe just a bit more color there in terms of puts and takes. I’m thinking about international margins would be helpful.
Hilton Schlosberg: Yeah, I think that as we look at the international business, we've spoken about the way the processing structure works in those markets, that we try and price ourselves close to where Red Bull is and that we have different models with the bottlers internationally that kind of force us into a different gross margin computation than we have in the U.S.Having said that, if I look for example at the EMEA margin, which we discussed earlier on the call, and the margins there fell from 42% to 38.7%, but there were a number of factors that went into – you know that went into that result. Firstly, and we’ve spoken about this before, we have country mix, we have brand mix, we have product mix. So we have a very extensive project now to reduce the juice content in a number of our juice products to enhance margin.We have other projects – and I just came back from the UK about two weeks ago, where the whole meeting was just focused on margin, focused on freight-in, focused on co-packers, focused on where best to allocate our resources to try and improve the gross margins, and we have this concentrate and Monster Progression that of course will be resolved in part when we are able to get Predator up and running. So there were a number of factors and then you always have one-offs in the quarter. So in the fourth quarter we had about a 1% hit to gross margin in EMEA through one off costs.So you know I think we are very well aware from this office, of the need to improve margins and we are working on improving the margins within the constraints of the strategic brands having higher margins than the Monster brands and Reign brands. Obviously our objective is to sell more Monster and so more Reign and if that takes away from the strategic brands, then so be it, because you know this is a Monster Beverage Corporation. This is what – our mission is to sell Monster and Reign products.So if the strategy brands will in fact, over time they may get hit. We are doing the best we can to keep them at their current levels and improve on them. But you know it's a mix and it will continue to be a mix and I'm not sure there’s anything more I can say. I probably said too much.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Sacks and Mr. Schlosberg for any closing remarks.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I would like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy, and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad, and in particular to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottler system internationally.We are particularly excited about the new opportunities we have going forward, with the portfolio of energy drinks throughout the world comprised of our Monster Energy brand, together with the strategic brands, as well as Hydro, Predator and Reign and the pretty extensive new innovation that we have. It’s recently introduced and are planning to continue to introduce throughout the rest of 2020. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-11-08 17:00:00) =====
Rodney Sacks: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I am Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President is with me; as is Tom Kelly, our Executive Vice President of Finance.As you may have already noticed, my voice is soft today. That’s because I recently had a benign polyp removed from my larynx. The good news is that I am fine. But I have been advised to use my voice sparingly.

Hilton Schlosberg: Thank you, Tom. We again to turn out to the quarter and we will move on from there. Consumer beverage preferences and tastes continue to evolve at an increasing pace. And we are endeavoring to address them through our ongoing innovation of new products.In the third quarter of 2019 net sales were $1.13 billion up 11.6% from $1.02 billion in the third quarter of 2018. Net sales for the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $12.2 million of foreign currency movements. Without these foreign currency movements, net sales for the quarter would have been up 12.8%.The comparative net sales in the 2018 third quarter included approximately $16 million in net sales of advanced purchases as a result of the price increase in the United States in of our products effective November 1, 2018. Adjusting for these advanced purchases and foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2019 third quarter would have been up 14.6%.Turning now to gross profit, gross profit as a percentage of sales for the 2019 third quarter was 59.4%, compared with 59.8% in the 2018 third quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2019 third quarter was primarily the result of geographical and product sales mix. Such decrease was partially offset by price increases, as well as reduced input costs.Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.3% for the 2019 third quarter, as compared to 4.1% in the 2018 third quarter.Selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.1% for the 2019 third quarter, as compared to 11.2% in the same quarter in 2018.General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 10.1% for the 2019 third quarter, as compared to 11.1% in the same quarter in 2018.In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales was 6.5%, compared to 6.2% in the same period in 2018. Payroll costs increased $10.4 million, primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally. Stock-based compensation and non-cash item were $16 million in the third quarter of 2019, compared to $14.1 million in the same quarter in 2018.Our effective tax rate increased from 21.8% in 2018 third quarter to 25% in the 2019 third quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions, as well as the decrease in the equity compensation deduction. In addition, the comparative effective tax rate for the 2018 third quarter included a non-recurring tax benefit.Net income was $298.9 million in the 2019 third quarter, compared to net income of $267.7 million in the 2018 third quarter, an increase of 11.6%.Diluted earnings per share for the 2019 third quarter increased 14% to $0.55 from $0.48 in the third quarter of 2018.Now we turn to The Coca-Cola Company transition update. In the third quarter of 2019 Monster Energy was launched by or transition to coke bottlers in the Dominican Republic, El Salvador and Honduras. We are planning further international launches later this year.We launched Predator, our affordable energy brand in the third quarter of 2019 in Botswana and in Slovakia. We are planning to launch Predator in selected additional markets in Eastern Europe and Africa in the fourth quarter of 2019.In China, we completed the rollout of both Monster Ultra Violet and Monster Mango in the third quarter. We have significantly expanded our shelf space for Monster with these three SKUs in our targeted top 40 cities and key accounts.We continue to roll out a Monster across India and began the launch of Ultra Violet into approximately 20% of our accounts in September. We will continue Ultra’s expansion into the fourth quarter, as well as commencing the launch Mango Loco to leverage consumer taste preferences in India.I will now briefly discuss a litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, VPX, the maker of Bang energy drinks. Monster filed a lawsuit against VPX in September 2018 for false advertising and VPX filed a trademark lawsuit against Monster in relation to our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in March 2019. Both proceedings are ongoing.In August 2019, VPX filed another lawsuit in the Southern District of Florida, alleging a host of legal challenges, including many similar to the claims Monster alleged against VPX. Monster will seek the dismissal of VPX’s most recent lawsuit.In October 2019, U.S. Court, the US District Court for the Southern District denied VPX’s motion for preliminary injunction against Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in its trademark lawsuit. In his decision, the Court ruled that VPX fail to meet any of the elements of a preliminary injunction and failed to establish that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its claims.The VPX recently announced an intention to launch its own Reign -- own line of Reign branded energy drinks in 16 ounce cans to be sold in convenience stores. We recently filed an expedited motion for preliminary injunction asking the court to stop this product launch and to prevent VPX from infringing Monster’s trademark rights in this way.In one of the Court findings in May 2019, we stated that sales of Reign beverages from June to December 2019 were projected to exceed $235 million. Our sales of Reign through October was solid, as illustrated by the Nielsen numbers were lower than our initial expectations.As with any new product launches, sales may be affected by many factors, including retail authorizations, the dates on which listings are secured for products with major retailers and introductions of new flavors. The company has not changed its practice with respect to projections and will not be providing projections with respect to Reign or any other products.As our litigation with VPX is subjugated, we will not be answering questions on this matter on today’s call.Now we are going to turn to the Nielsen reports in North America. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through October 26, 2019 all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots increased by 9.1% versus the same period a year ago.Sales of the company’s energy brands including Reign grew 4.6% in a 13-week period. Sales of Monster were down 2.4%. Sale of NOS decreased 1.8% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 12.8%. Sales of Red Bull increased 6.4%. Sales of Rockstar decreased by 10.8%. Sales of 5-Hour decreased 9% and sales of Amp decreased 42.4%.

Amp and affordable energy brand launched in March increased its market share to 8.7% in the month of September 2019.The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that maybe undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.Now I would turn to EMEA, I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be use as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country-to-country.According to Nielsen the 13 weeks ended October 5, 2019, Monster’s retail market share in value as compared to the same period of previous year grew from 12.3% to 12.9% in Belgium, from 23.3% to 27.6% in France, from 20.9% to 21.5% in Great Britain, from 7.1% to 7.2% in the Netherlands, from 18.0% to 23.7% in Norway, and from 30.3% to 33.4% in Spain.

We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or four-week period may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods.So, now we are going to turn to sales and the segments. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the third quarter of 2019, which include Reign increased 13.5% from $935.1 million to $1.06 billion from the comparable period in 2018.Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the third quarter of 2019 were negatively impacted by approximately $10.8 million of foreign currency movements. Without these foreign currency movements net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the quarter would have been up 14.7%.The comparative net sales in the 2018 third quarter included approximately $16 million in net sales with advanced purchases as a result of the price increase in the United States by uncertain about products effective November 1, 2018. Adjusting for these advanced purchases and foreign currency movement net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the 2019 third quarter would have been up 16.6%.Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment which includes Predator Affordable Energy brand was $66.3 million for the third quarter as compared to $74.4 million in the same quarter in 2018. Net sales for the company’s Strategic Brands segment in the third quarter of 2019 were negatively impacted by approximately $1.4 million of foreign currency movement.Net sales for the Other segments, which includes third-party sales made by AFF were $5.9 million in the third quarter, as compared to $6.6 million in the same quarter in 2018.Net sales to customers outside the United States were $379.8 million, that’s 32.5% of total net sales in the 2019 third quarter, compared to $283 million or 28.6% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2018. Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $12.2 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company’s military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and trans-shipped to the military and their customers overseas.Now, we turn to sales in EMEA, in EMEA supply chain and production issues have largely been resolved. In EMEA net sales in the third quarter increased 34.1% in dollars and increased 40.1% in local currencies over the same period in 2018.Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 39.3%, compared to 41.3% in the same quarter in 2018. Gross profit percentage for the region was impacted by country and product mix, as well as increases in manufacturing costs.We are also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gain market share in Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, South Africa and Spain.Now turning to Asia-Pacific, in Asia-Pacific net sales in the third quarter increased 43.6% in dollars and 43.4%in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 40.5% versus 44.1% over the same period in 2018 as a result of country and product mix.

In Brazil net sales in the quarter increased by 80.2% in dollars and increased 82.3% in local currency. Net sales in Chile increased 70.9% in dollars and increased 84.2% in local currency in the quarter.So now turning to new products in North America, in United States, we launched Monster Mule Ginger Brew nationally, Reign Orange Creamsicle, Monster MAXX, Mango Magic and Monster MAXX Red-Red extra strength with zero sugar at the end of September. In October, we launched Java Monster Farmers Oats, which contains Oatmilk and is non-dairy and vegan, as well as two new flavors in the Reign brand family, Strawberry Sublime and Mango Magic. In 2020 in United States we will be discontinuing our Cafe Monster line of products and repositioning our Espresso Monster line.In Canada in the third quarter of 2019 we launched Monster Pacific Punch nationally in July, as well as Monster Mule nationally in September. During the third quarter of 2019 in Mexico we launched Pipeline Punch. During the third quarter of 2019 in Brazil, we launched Absolutely Zero, Ultra Violet, as well as Mango Loco,Now turning to new products in EMEA, Monster Pipeline Punch was launched in Bosnia, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia, Greece, Poland and Slovenia in the third quarter of 2019, and is now available in 15 markets across EMEA. Espresso Monster was made available in six markets in EMEA, France, Great Britain, Germany, Norway, Spain and Sweden in both milk and vanilla variants during the 2019 third quarter. We also recently launched both variants in Belgium and Ireland in October 2019 and will launch both in Poland this month. We are pleased with the performance of Espresso Monster in EMEA.We are planning to rollout two flavors of Espresso Monster into further 12 markets in the fourth quarter of 2019 and throughout 2020. Additionally, we are looking to launch our new Salted Caramel Espresso variant in eight EMEA markets over the course of the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2020.Reign has launched in Sweden in the third quarter of 2019 and we are planning to launch Reign in the further two markets by the end of 2019. We are planning to launch Monster in Israel in the fourth quarter of 2019. We are planning to launch Predator, our affordable energy brand in Ethiopia, Kenya, Poland, Uganda and Zambia in the 2019 fourth quarter.Turning to new products in Asia-Pacific, we launched Monster Green in 500 milliliter resealable aluminum bottles in Japan during the 2019 third quarter. In Korea, we launched Pipeline Punch with initial positive results. We launched Ultra White in India and competed its rollout in Vietnam during the 2019 quarter. Ultra Paradise launched in Australia in July and in New Zealand in September, and Mango Loco was successfully relaunched in July after resolution of local production capabilities. We are planning to launch a number of products in Asia-Pacific over the upcoming months, including a full relaunch of Pipeline Punch in Japan in the spring of 2020.Now turning to balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $717.6 million at September 30, 2019, compared to $637.5 million at December 31, 2018. Short-term investments were $597.4 million at September 30, 2019, compared to $320.7 million at December 31, 2018. Net accounts receivable increased to $648 million at September 30, 2019 from $484.6 million at December 31, 2018.Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 44.6 days at September 30, 2019, compared to 41.4 days at December 31, 2018. Inventories increased to $317.7 million at September 30, 2019 from $277.7 million at December 31, 2018. Average days of inventory were 62.1 days at September 30, 2019, compared to 67.2 days at December 31, 2018.Now we can talk a little about October 2019 gross sales. We estimate October 2019 gross sales to be approximately 7.3% higher than in October 2018. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, October 2019 gross sales would have been approximately 8.6% higher than comparable October 2018 gross sales.The comparative gross sales in October 2018 included advanced purchases as a result of the price increase in the United States on certain of our products effective November 1, 2018. Adjusting for these advanced purchases and foreign currency movements, we estimate gross sales for the month of October 2019 would have been approximately 14.6% higher than in October 2018.In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period, often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distribute incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances, where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers, as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even two months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.Share repurchase programs, during the 2019 third quarter the company purchased approximately 4.3 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $58.60 per share, for a total of $254.3 million excluding broker commissions.As of November 6, 2019, approximately $36.6 million remains available for -- US$36.6 million remains available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase program. On November 6, 2019, the company’s Board of Directors authorize a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional $500 million of the company’s outstanding common stock.In conclusion, I’d like to summarize some recent positive points. Retail sales statistics for many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and then Monster is generally going ahead of the category in line with the earlier periods.Number two, the new additions to the Monster family continue to add the company’s sales.Number three, we are excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches this year, as well as our innovation pipeline in 2024.Fourthly, we are encouraged by the prospects for Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks, not only within the U.S. but looking further abroad.Number five, we are pleased with our growth and performance in our international markets. Net sales in the third quarter in EMEA increased 40.1% in local currency, in Asia-Pacific increased 43.4% in local currency and in Latin America and the Caribbean increased 51% in local currency. We reiterated the growth potential for us in China and India.And lastly, we are proceeding with our plans for future launches of Affordable Energy Drink brands internationally. We also proceeding with our plans for the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in certain countries outside of the U.S.I’d like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you all, and Rodney, I wish you a fast recovery. And so you can help us with the positioning of the core Monster, which I understand correct, if I understand correctly was down 2.4% in all outlets and declined 5% in convenience. Do you believe that is related to the promotional environment of your main competitor or just a function of Reign gaining more shelf space? And how are you planning to react to that? Will you feel the need for more promotion for to become more promotion as well or you are just happy with the total performance? Thank you.
Rodney Sacks: Well, I will take that. Forgive of my vocal. Just I think that if you look at the category, what we have noticed is you have had an impact on all of the -- pretty much on all of the SKUs that are had been existing in the market over the past couple of months. You are seeing the increases coming from us and our main competitor coming from new products.So -- but -- if you look at the total category, the total category remains healthy. It’s up 9%, which is really good growth. So the category is growing. It’s been a shift within the category. We -- you have got to look at brands and whatever we have in the category. So you look at the fact that we are down or some of the individually SKUs are down. But overall, the category is growing, our overall corporate sales are growing, we would address obviously individual SKUs.And I think this is an experience that’s being experienced by general consumer products for established brands. There is a movement generally on consumers to want to try new products, new flavors, new innovation. And we do have a new innovation, which we -- some of that we have announced we recently launched. We have plans to launch quite a lot of new innovation. I think that in some cases, some of our new innovation that we launched earlier this year, perhaps, didn’t get enough shelf space or there have been some shelf space taken from our existing product, which I think has affected sales.So looking at one of the sort of main things I think we will look at going forward is improving the quality of our distribution, getting out innovation more efficiently and more effectively on the shelves And as we go forward, we believe there will be additional space allocated to the performance energy category, which will relieve pressure on the space we are looking for our existing energy brands and the innovation under the Monster line.
Hilton Schlosberg: So just to add to what Rodney is saying, if you asked, if we are happy with the way things are, and obviously, we are not. We want to see the Monster brand growing. What we have evidence of is that the price increase has stuck. And when you will get our Q tomorrow and you can even see it, I think, in the release, that the promotional allowances are very much in line with where they should be and we are not over promoting.Having said that, I just want to reiterate that the category if you look back 52 weeks, the energy category has shown incremental growth per Nielsen of $1.3 billion. So this is a growing category and it’s a category that now has a new segment, which is performance energy and performance energy is growing within that category.And, as I look at some of our other competitors, and this is no defense, but as we look for example, even at Red Bull, which is growing and we mentioned on the call that it’s growing. The Red Bull core brands also not showing growth. The diet SKUs are and their additions are, but in general the Red Bull core brands are also not showing growth and are in decline. Having said that, we have got plans with our distribution, which has been a challenge to dramatically improve distribution and distribution on shelf and in the coolers.
Rodney Sacks: Perhaps there’s just one other aspect I’d like to add to that, this is sort of broad view. These comments we have made really focus on the U.S. and the US has been our major market. But as we develop as a company, the opportunity for us for our energy brands Monster in particular plus our other brands is international.And if you look at the information we just gave on this call about how we have accelerated international growth in existing international markets and new markets, that’s where we look to in the future for the company.Our sales as we -- U.S. was about 72% of our sales last year this quarter and it’s now down to 67. So if you take that with as a growth position, it’s going to continue to grow. So we see a lot of run way to grow internationally, to grow the brand and these markets are continuing to grow and are very healthy.So, we need to address challenges we have in the U.S. at the moment. But, overall, we still believe in the health and we still believe in the growth of the brand both internationally and even in -- within the U.S. as well in our other energy brands.
Hilton Schlosberg: And then one thing we really should -- turning back a few years for a moment, sorry. The one thing we really should not forget about is the unmeasured channels, which we have been absolutely emphatic about, our Food Service is unmeasured, Amazon is unmeasured, Costco is unmeasured, and a slew of other Home Depot and Lowes all of those channels are unmeasured. And the amount of sales that are going through those channels is really -- is a significant number.
Rodney Sacks: Thanks.
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you both.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Steve Powers: Yes. Thank you. Maybe a little bit more on the U.S. Can you talk about growth in the quarter coming in a touch below 3% versus the Nielsen data over the course of the quarter pointing closer to 6%? I think we all know you had tough comparisons in the year ago quarter, but at the same time, there was an extra selling day this quarter. And so just how do you think about that 3% number in light of those factors, building on Andrea’s question? And then if I could related question, building on what you just said, but in the context of Coke Energy, and I think, that we all appreciate what you and Coke have each said about the intended interplay between Monster and really Monster and Reign and Coke energy and that they are targeted different consumers and designed to minimize cannibalization risk, but given that they will be going through common distributors, just how confident are you that those new Coke SKUs won’t take away from some of your smaller SKU use whether Monster Reign, NOS, Full Throttle or otherwise, rather than having them successfully fine incremental space in the cooler or take away from competition distributed by others? Thanks.
Hilton Schlosberg: So let me start with your first question. When you look at Nielsen and you look at our own financial numbers, you cannot draw an exact interpolation from one to the other. Nielsen sales out, our sales are sells to the distributors, the bottlers. We have a SKU of unmeasured channels that I mentioned. And while it’s a good indication of what’s of the movement of sales, it’s not an absolute science and one has to be very wary, but we have said this on many calls in the past, I am going to be very careful trying to balance our sales to our bottlers and our distributors with sales out to the consumer.Nielsen read a sample. They don’t read all the channels. They don’t read, as I said, the Food Service, they don’t read Amazon, they don’t read Costco. They don’t read the Home Depot’s and the Lowe’s and all the other channels where our products are distributed. So it’s difficult to draw a comparison from one to the other. All we can do is give you the facts and you guys make your own assessments from there.
Rodney Sacks: Now as regards to Coke Energy. I think that most of the analysts are very up-to-date and astute on analyzing Nielsen well. They should be looking and analyzing Nielsen around the world and that would give everybody their own view on what’s been happening with the rollout of Coke Energy around the world.We have seen the brand rollout and we have also seen the rate of sale, not keeping pace with initial sales, the percentage market share has been small and hasn’t really had an impact on us. The main impact that I think we will repeatedly said is that we did have concerns or is the sort of noise and in the market and focus from divergence of focus. But ultimately, in Europe, things are settling down, our growth rates of our brands are on track and have continued.And I think that by and large, the Coke system has pretty much focused on not trying to cannibalize our existing products and take pricing from us and it has worked reasonably well. There have been a few countries where there have been some challenges and we have addressed them.So, again, we don’t know, we can’t tell what Coke Energy will be in the United States. It’s formulated little differently. It’s a little different in sizes. There are two variants. But, ultimately, we think that, we just need to manage the lack of focus or conflict of focusing from to bottlers. Ultimately, we don’t think it will have a major impact on our brand and we will manage it and going forward how you feel.
Hilton Schlosberg: Yeah. I mean, what I would do if I were an analyst, I would get the information from the markets in which they have launched and there are a number of them. And frankly, they have not -- the numbers that I have seen and I can’t talk for numbers that other people may have seen. The numbers that I have seen are showing that they have not performed particularly well and that our brands have continued to grow and our brands have continued to develop in those markets. But get the homework.
Rodney Sacks: We don’t know what the U.S. will be, it’s own market. And so we will see how things go and we will manage it.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel. Your line is now open.
Mark Astrachan: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. And Tom, good to hear from you on the call today.
Tom Kelly: Thank you, Mark.
Mark Astrachan: There it is again. So, I guess, I wanted to ask about gross margin. International continues to be a bit of a sore spot there. U.S. again continued to be pretty good. So you touched on some of the supply chain issues and EMEA having been resolved and kind of talking directionally to stabilization or at least that’s maybe my interpretation of it. LatAm was obviously flat in gross margin. So is the worst behind you at this point. You have anymore visibility on that, I am not asking for guidance. I love a personal point of view, kind of how we should all think about that since I think it’s one of those areas that is a bit more of a black box than others. So any help there would be a appreciate it?
Hilton Schlosberg: It’s not really a black box. I mean, we sell concentrates at high margins and through the strategic brands. And we sell finished products at different margins that really are a base for a number of factors on the relationships we have developed with the bottlers and distributors in various countries and the cost of production.So it’s always every quarter the issue is how much do we sell internationally, which has low margins and I will get on to that, and I think, I have discussed it on a previous call. And how much strategic brands did we sell as a cooperation versus finished goods at Monster Energy.So when we established a model in the United States, the distributors were allocated on margin, which was satisfactory to them and we had the lion’s share of the margin. As we have grown internationally in more virgin territories, the bottles in the Coke system where we have transitioned or launched with, they have demanded a highest share of the value chain.And this is something that we have had to deal with, understanding that if we want to launch in various countries internationally, that’s going to cost us more in margin than in the U.S., where we had a very established business and the Coca-Cola bottlers segued into this establish business with the same margins. We also have different costs impacts around the world, which we try to manage as best as we can.And then one of the other issues that we are facing is that our juice products are doing very well. Our coffee products are doing very well and they themselves have lower margins than the traditional Monster beverages, which have, and of course, the diet has the best margin of all.So, you have this issue of competing margins. However, there are things we can do with the juice products, we can establish greater efficiencies. We had a big improvement this year in this quarter in the U.S. In fact in freight getting product and raw materials to our co-packers, that was big benefit -- the other benefit that we had in the U.S. was in aluminum.So there is a difficult range of factors that go into what the overall consolidated margin is. It is not just a simple one calculation. But we are working on it. And, as we have done in the U.S. and as we have done with freight in, we continue to look at our model internationally, and see where we can improve on our gross margin percentages. And as I have always said, Mark, we sell products and we make gross profit dollars. We don’t make gross profit percentages.
Rodney Sacks: I think that the only thing I would like to add to that is -- very briefly is that, in the international market, there are a lot of markets that we have had to traditionally shipped into many markets, so many countries from other countries.We have -- and as we continue to expand and have sufficient volumes in countries, we are all switching to local production in those countries. We have opened up quite a number of additional production facilities in Europe this year and have got a number -- a large number going forward, and as we go forward, we think that will certainly help our margins internationally as well. But, at this point we just don’t think there is any numbers we can point you to.
Hilton Schlosberg: And also the community knows that we purchased REFILE, the concentrate facility from the Coca-Cola Company with the intention of producing ingredients in EMEA, which will reduce our improving efficiencies, improve costs and reduce the huge distances that we shipping these ingredients right now.
Rodney Sacks: Yeah. We will also address some of the challenges we had last year and a little bit this year even in out of stocks and where we have increased demand for particular products, we had very long lead times in order to ship ingredients to pack us to try increased volumes this will obviously improve those efficiencies and will help us going forward. So that’s been a -- we think we are very excited about the fact that that will help us in the whole of the EMEA and Middle East and Africa.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Rodney Sacks and Mr. Hilton Schlosberg for further remarks.
Hilton Schlosberg: So thank you. You got my name right. We tested them before that, so well done on that. Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I’d like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in what we are doing in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continue to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and expand the company both at home and abroad, and in particularly expand distribution of our products to the Coca-Cola bottler system internationally. We always excited by the new opportunities that we have going forward with a portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world, comprised of our Monster Energy brand together with our strategic brands as well as Hydro, Predator and Reign and the new innovation plan for 2020.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-08-08 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Corporation Second Quarter 2019 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Sir, you may begin.
Rodney Sacks: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Executive Vice President of Finance.Before we begin, I'd like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance, and trends.Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the Company, that may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements made during this call.Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2019, and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed on May 3, 2019 including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements, for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated August 7, 2019.A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. Consumer beverage preferences and tastes are continuing to evolve, and we are endeavoring to address them through our ongoing innovation of new products.In the second quarter of 2019, net sales were $1.1 billion, up 8.7% from $1.02 billion in the second quarter of 2018. Net sales in the second quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $25.9 million of foreign currency movements. Without these foreign currency movements, net sales for the quarter would have been up 11.2%.Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2019 second quarter was 59.9% compared with 61.1% in the 2018 second quarter. For the quarter ended June 30, 2019, gross profit as a percentage of net sales was positively affected by increased sales prices of our products sold in the United States and Canada, as well as by reduced aluminum costs. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales were primarily negatively affected by geographical and product sales mix and increases in certain input costs.Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.4% for the 2019 second quarter as compared to 3.7% in the 2018 second quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.2% for the 2019 second quarter as compared to 11.4% in the same quarter in 2018. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 10.9% for the 2019 second quarter as compared to 10.7% in the same quarter in 2018. In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales were 6.6% compared to 6.5% in the same period in 2018.Payroll costs increased $7.4 million in dollars, primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally as well as an increase in payroll taxes. Stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash item, was $15.6 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $14.9 million in the same quarter in 2018.Our effective tax rate decreased from 24.6% in the 2018 second quarter to 23.4% in the 2019 second quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase in profits earned by certain foreign subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions than the United States.Net income was $292.5 million in the 2019 second quarter, compared to the net income of $270.1 million in the 2018 second quarter and increase of 8.3%. Diluted earnings per share for the 2019 second quarter increased 11.9% to $0.53 from $0.48 in the second quarter of 2018.We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers globally. We transitioned the distribution of Monster Energy drinks from Big Geyser's territory, which is located in New York metro markets to Liberty Coca-Cola in early April 2019. As of April 6, 2019, the United States has fully transitioned to Coca-Cola network bottlers. In the second quarter of 2019, Monster Energy was launched by Coke Bottlers in Azerbaijan, Paraguay, and Saudi Arabia.We are planning further international launches later this year. We launched Predator, our affordable energy brand in the second quarter of 2019 in certain markets in Europe, namely Greece, Bulgaria, and Cyprus. We are planning to launch prototype connected additional markets in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa throughout the second half of 2019.In China, we completed the rollout of Monster Ultra in the second quarter and also launched Monster Mango. We have significantly expanded our shelf space for Monster with three SKUs in our targeted top 40 cities and key accounts. We continued the rollout of Monster across India, and are planning additional SKU launches in India later in 2019.I will now briefly discuss arbitration with the Coca-Cola Company and litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., VPX, the maker of Bang energy drinks. As we have previously disclosed, in October 2018, Monster Beverage Corporation and the Coca-Cola Company mutually agreed to submit to arbitration the issue of where that Coca-Cola is permitted to manufacture, market, sell, or distribute energy drink products, it had developed under the Coca-Cola brand.On June 28, 2019, the arbitration panel issued a final awarding in favor of Coca-Cola. Regardless of this outcome, Monster and Coca-Cola value the relationship and look forward to continuing their partnership.I've also previously addressed the lawsuit filed against VPX in September 2018 for false advertising and VPX’s trademark lawsuit against Monster filed in March, 2019, but proceedings are ongoing. In one of the court filings in May, 2019, we stated that sales of Reign beverages from June through December 2019 were projected to exceed $235 million.Our sales of Reign [ph] for June and July was solid as illustrated by the Nielsen numbers were lower than our initial expectations. As any new product launches, sales may be affected by many factors, including authorizations, the date or dates on which listings are secured for products with major retailers and introductions of new flavors. The Company has not changed its practice with respect to projections and will not be providing projections with respect to Reign or any other products.As our litigation with VPX is subjugated, we will not be answering questions on this matter on today's call. According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through July 27, 2019, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including energy shots, increased by 9.9% versus the same period a year-ago.Sales of the Company’s energy brands including Reign grew 5.6% in the 13-week period.

Monster share decreased 4.2 share points to 33.5%, Reign’s share was 3.4%, NOS' share declined 0.3 share points to 3.5%, and Full Throttle's share declined 0.2 points to 0.7%.Red Bull's share decreased 1.6 points to 33.7%, Rockstar share was down 1.6 points to 4.9%, 5-Hour share was lower by 1.1 points at 5.4%, and Amp share decreased 0.3 of a point to 0.4%. VPX Bang's share was 8.1%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended July 27, 2019, sales of coffee plus energy drinks, which includes Caffe Monster and Espresso Monster, in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 9.8% over the same period the previous year.Sales of our Java Monster alone were 6.6% higher than in the same period the previous year. Sales of our other coffee plus energy drinks were 3% lower, while sales of Starbucks Energy were 18.3% higher. Our Company's share of the coffee plus energy category, which includes Java Monster, Caffe Monster, Espresso Monster, Starbucks Double Shot and Rockstar Roasted, for the four weeks ended July 20, 2019, was 49.1%, down 6.5 points.Java Monster's share on its own for the four weeks ended July 27, 2019, was 43.9%, down 1.3 points, while Starbucks Energy share was 47.7%, up 3.4 points. According to Nielsen, in the community and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended June 22, 2019, the energy drink category increased 4% in dollars.

Amp and affordable energy brand launch in March increased its market share to 6.2% in June 2019.The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that maybe undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country and also are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country-to-country.According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended July 2019, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 12.2% to 12.7% in Belgium, from 22.1% to 27.4% in France, from 19.5% to 20.9% in Great Britain, and from 7.2% to 7.3% in the Netherlands, from 17.8% to 24.5% in Norway, and from 30.3% to 32.5% in Spain.According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending June 2019, Monster's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 16% to 16.1% in Germany, from 11.2% to 14.3% in Poland, from 14.8% to 16.5% in South Africa, and from 12.6% to 12.8% in Sweden.According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending May 2019, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 12.6% to 13.4% in the Czech Republic, from 31.8% to 34.7% in Greece, from 14.6% to 17.8% in Ireland, and from 14.3% to 18.5% in Italy.According to Nielsen, for the month of June 2019 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 34.2% to 37.4% compared to the same period the previous year. According to Nielsen in Brazil, Monster's retail market share for the month of June 2019 increased from 17.9% to 22.6% as compared to the same period the previous year. We launched Monster Energy in Argentina in mid-February 2018.According to Nielsen, for the month of June 2019, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 12% to 25.4% compared to the same period the previous year. According to IRI in Australia, Monster's market share in value for the four weeks ending June 30, 2019, increased from 7.7% to 9.3% as compared to the same period the previous year.Mother's market share in value increased from 14.3% to 14.5% during the same period. According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the four weeks ending June 30, 2019, increased from 6% to 7.7% as compared to the same period the previous year.Lift Plus market share in value decreased from 10.6% to 8.4% and Mother's market share in value increased from 6.2% to 6.6%.

We again point out that in certain market statistics that cover single month may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those months.Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the second quarter of 2019 which includes Reign increased 9.6% from $929 million to $1.02 billion from the comparable period in 2018. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the second quarter of 2019 were negatively impacted by approximately $22.1 million of foreign currency movements.A net sale for the Strategic Brands segment, which includes Predator, our affordable energy brand was $79.1 million for the second quarter as compared to $79.8 million in the same quarter in 2018. Net sales for the Company's Strategic Brands segment in the second quarter of 2019 were negatively impacted by approximately $3.8 million of foreign currency movements.Net sales for the other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF were $5.8 million in the second quarter as compared to $6.6 million in the same quarter in 2018. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $343.3 million or 31% of total net sales in the 2019 second quarter, compared to $293.8 million, which is 28.9% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2018. Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $25.9 million.Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the Company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA, supply chain and production issues were considerably reduced versus previous quarters, but still continue to effect performance in the second quarter. As mentioned earlier, our Nielsen growth rates and market share continues to be strong in the territory.We are continuing to managing through and reduce these supply chain and production issues. Certain of our co-packers that contributed in part to these issues are back on track. Furthermore, we have secured and are continuing to securing additional production capacity.In EMEA, net sales in the second quarter increased 10.9% in dollars and increased 21.1% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 39.5% compared to 43.8% in the same quarter in 2018.Gross profit percentage for the region was impacted by country and product mix, as well as increases in manufacturing costs. We are also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gained market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden.In Asia Pacific, net sales in the second quarter increased 35.1% in dollars and 41.5% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 43.6% versus 49% over the same period in 2018, as a result of country and product mix.In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 33.5% in dollars and 37.8% in local currency.

Net sales in Chile decreased 2.4% in dollars, but increased 8% in local currency in the quarter.Our new product launches in the U.S. largely took place in the first quarter of 2019. We plan to launch a number of products in the United States later this year, namely Monster Mule, Reign Orange Creamsicle, Reign Strawberry Sublime and Reign Mango magic as well as Monster MAXX Mango magic and Monster MAXX Red-Red extra strength with zero sugar. As well as a new innovative Java Monster Line extension. The details of which will be revealed at a later date.We launched Monster Pacific Punch in May with the convenience chain customers as a first to market exclusive in Canada with a national launch in July 2019 and also launching Monster Mule later into 2019 in Canada. In Mexico, we launched Monster Mango Loco in April 2019. During the second quarter of 2019 we launched Monster Pacific Punch in the Caribbean and extended our range in Puerto Rica. We also launched Predator in Trinidad in May 20, 2019.In the second quarter of 2019, we launched Monster Mango Loco in several countries across the EMEA. Monster Mango Loco is now available in 31 EMEA markets. We continue to launch different Monster Line extensions and our strategic brands in several countries across EMEA markets.Monster Pipeline Punch was launched in South Africa in the second quarter of 2019 and it will be launched in a further six markets in the second half of 2019. We also launched Espresso Monster and Espresso Monster Vanilla in France, Norway and Sweden. We are planning to expand the rollout of our Espresso Monster Line in Europe and we anticipate that Espresso Monster will be available in 29 countries in EMEA by the end of 2019.We are planning to launch Monster in Israel in the fourth quarter of 2019. We're also planning to launch Predator, our affordable energy brand in additional markets in EMEA and Predator should be available in 19 EMEA countries by the end of 2019. We launched Pipeline Punch in Japan in May for a limited period. We also want Mango Loco in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan and Ultra launched in Malaysia and Vietnam in the second quarter. We plan to launch a number of products in Asia Pacific later this year, including a full country launch of Pipeline Punch in Japan in the spring of 2020.Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $888.3 million at June 30, 2019, compared to $637.5 million at December 31, 2018. Short-term investments were $358 million at June 30, 2019, compared to $320.7 million at December 31, 2018.Net accounts receivable increased to $688.2 million at June 30, 2019, from $484.6 million at December 31, 2018. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 48.5 days at June 30, 2019, compared to 41.4 days at December 31, 2018. Inventories increased to $299.5 million at June 30, 2019, from $277.7 million at December 31, 2018.Average days of inventory were 60.9 days at June 30, 2019, compared to 67 days at December 31, 2018. We estimate July 2019 gross sales to be approximately 16.1% higher than in July 2018. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis, July 2019 gross sales would have been approximately 17.4% higher than comparable July 2018 gross sales. There was one more selling day in July 2019 than in July 2018.In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances, where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even two months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. During the 2019 second quarter, no shares repurchased under the previously authorized share repurchase program. As of August 7, 2019 approximately $520.6 million remained available for repurchase under our previously authorized repurchase programs.In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. Retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category, in line with earlier periods.The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We are excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches. We are encouraged by the prospects for our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks, and note that Reign launched at Wal-Mart last week. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India.We are continuing with our plans to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola Bottlers in certain new markets. We are proceeding with our plans for future launches of our affordable energy brands internationally. We are also proceeding with our plans for the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in certain countries outside of the USA.I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Caroline Levy with Macquarie. Your line is open.
Caroline Levy: Thanks and good afternoon.
Rodney Sacks: Good afternoon.
Caroline Levy: Just hoping you could give a little background on what you see happening in the performance energy category, whether you were doing the BOGOs in the second quarter and if those pull back. Just what the impact of Reign had on your business and whether you see any slowdown in BOGOs [ph] progress? Just anything you can talk about with that sort of disruptive area.
Rodney Sacks: Well, obviously the performance category has had an impact on the overall energy category. And Reign has continued to perform up to our expectations. We are comfortable with the performance. It's a new product. It just got out and it's obviously going to find its feet in different markets and in different channels. The BOGO did not hit all at one time and some parts of the BOGO took place through the end of June, and I think 7/11 and there were some others that did bleed into July continuing.When we look at the BOGO, if you look at the average Reign sales on a weekly basis in Nielsen, it's been reasonably consistent over the past number of weeks. And so, we don't believe that the BOGO and the tailing off of the BOGO had a really marked influence on the sell rates. So we are comfortable with the ongoing sell rate of Reign. A lot of it depends on timing, getting our products onto the shelves, getting shelves space. As we've launched it, we've had to create shelf space.In many cases, the products are not still worked into schematics, they are still being – schematics are being reset now and later in the year. So those things will continue to, I think affect the performance of the performance energy category. Now, there are a number of other performance energy drinks, there's Bang, and there are also some other performance energy drinks that are seeking to obtain listings in space in the convenience channel such as Celsius and C4 and others.And so, we think that there will ultimately be an additional space allocated to the performance energy drinks. As part of the broader energy drink category in the existing space or probably you will start seeing some additional space being allocated in C stores and coolers alongside or adjacent to the energy space.We think there will be some development of a sort of subset or category of performance-based drinks that will be lumped together. They will also take into account product, we think like Hydro and other performance energy drinks that just generally fall outside of the pure carbonated sparkling sort of traditional energy drinks.And I think we should not meet the Walmart listing, which has really been a few good days now. And the team has done an incredible job of getting out and really stacking products that it will mind. So I think good things from that come as well.
Hilton Schlosberg: But as with everything, it's timing, and so that only happened in the last few days as opposed to earlier in the year. So we do think that that will start having a positive impact again on Reign's sales and numbers. And we've also got good listings with Dollar General and a lot of other non-traditional retail stores for Reign.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you. Just to clarify, the July figure includes the selling to Walmart for Reign and can you help us quantify the benefits of Reign in acquiring both sales and the negative impact of the margin for the BOGO promotion? Thank you.
Hilton Schlosberg: So, please remember that we don't sell to Walmart direct. It goes through the distributors. So, it's hard for us to extrapolate those numbers at this time for July. Those are regular July numbers that the distributors would order from us.
Andrea Teixeira: But you can confirm that you started – that you've got the distribution at Walmart for Reign?
Hilton Schlosberg: Yes. They anticipated the distribution for Walmart, but they knew it was going to happen. We knew it was going to happen. And they built up inventory according to their schedules to accommodate that listing, which is a big listing as you know.
Rodney Sacks: Yes. Let's start it in the beginning of August. So obviously there would be some sales.
Hilton Schlosberg: So listing…
Rodney Sacks: Yes. The listing – there will be some. We don't know.
Hilton Schlosberg: And then may be sales in June as well and we don't know.
Rodney Sacks: Yes.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.
Vivien Azer: Hi, good afternoon. I was hoping to get your thoughts on what's happening with the core Monster brand and whether you've done any diagnosis around some of the pressure there. Is it primarily from Bang? Is it more from Reign and if it's the latter, how is cannibalization tracking relative to your expectations? Thank you very much.
Rodney Sacks: Are you talking about the U.S. or internationally? I'm just trying to get an understanding of what you're referring to?
Vivien Azer: The U.S. please.
Rodney Sacks: Okay. The emergence of the performance energy sort of subcategory or subset within the energy category clearly has had an effect on sales of Monster generally, which is – as well as on the sales of other energy drinks that have really been in the market historically, which is Red Bull and Rockstar and others, even our other brands, NOS and Full Throttle.So there's been an effect on all of those brands. When you look at it on a stack basis, the Monster Energy category had a really good year in 2018. And so, you've got to look at it all over. There clearly has been an impact in this year, and in the second quarter.We are seeing some stabilizing of the other brands and – but overall, we look at the business on an overall basis and on an overall basis, the category is continuing to grow. We are still participating in an overall brands within the category are continuing to grow.And this is not too dissimilar to certain other markets internationally where you've got disruptors or lower affordable energy brands going to the market that you take a market like, Mexico for example, while they were in premium energy category, the shares, our shares were higher as an affordable energy brands got into that market. They grew the market overall and our sales grew continued to grow.Although our share of market if you take those affordable brands and then recategorize and market into a broader market, obviously our share percentage-wise started to and did dropped and lower in Mexico while we've continued to see continued increases and positive sales in Mexico throughout the periods that the category has gone through this redefinition.And so that's where we think, we are all seeing the category in the U.S. and it will continue to grow and evolve. But overall, we obviously are looking to new innovation, we've got new innovation plan for later this year and next year and we do believe that we'll continue to have – Monster will continue to grow in the U.S. as well as the other products in our portfolio.
Hilton Schlosberg: But U.S. has been some cannibalization on Monster. These being Reign is taking share from other brands as well and did as has Bang. So you look here, the category, the energy category, which includes both the traditional energy that we know, and the performance energy drinks and that together makes up the total energy drink category today.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is open.
Mark Astrachan: Yes. Hey, good afternoon, guys.
Rodney Sacks: Hi, Mark.
Mark Astrachan: Lots of questions, I guess just starting on the U.S., so I'm curious just the cadence of the quarter. We obviously see what month of April that it implies May, June we're up like 4% on an all-in basis. U.S. sales 6%, I guess sort of in line with scanner data, but if you exclude your commentary about Reign selling basically implies you didn't sell another product in the quarterSo maybe you give a bit more detail about – just what channel inventories look like, what shipments look like or whether some sort of issue in the quarter and shipping product from a retailer standpoint. And then completely different just what happened in international gross margins I heard what you said, but what specifically is going on there that's driving the overall continued weakness there.
Hilton Schlosberg: So maybe I can start with the second question about gross margins internationally. So there were a number of reasons for the decline in international margins and many of these reasons we've actually spoken about on previous calls. So we said that our Monster energy drinks have a lower gross profit percentage. They're not strategic brands which are largely sales of concentrate.So as international sales Monster grows at a faster pace, then the strategic brands overall gross profit percentages are negatively impacted. Our international innovation in the quarter was in part driven by the juice SKUs, which we spoke about on this call and Espresso Monster principally in EMEA which also have lower margins in our non-juice Monster SKUs. There's also had an impact on the gross profit percentage in the quarter. Country mix is another factor; we sell in some countries that have lower percentage margins than in other countries. Mark, I'm giving the whole shopping list.In the quarter ForEx negatively impacted the cost of goods in certain countries, particularly in LATAM that import finished products from the U.S. and from Mexico. This impact obviously was less when certain ingredients only are important not the finish goods. In certain overseas countries as you know, we operate different value sharing models with certain bottlers and that could and did have an impact in the quarter.Production issues and capacity constraints in EMEA also impacted margins in the quarter. So some of these items should not be re reoccurring and frankly we are confident with the operating model. We've had a number of issues EMEA which we prefer to, we are getting to the end of those we believe, but we are comfortable with the model and also with our ability to manage our costs.So I hope that answered your question probably in more detail than you wanted.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks.
Rodney Sacks: I would like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the Company. We continue to believe in the Company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the Company both at home and abroad and in particular to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola Bottling system internationally.We're also particularly excited about new opportunities that we have going forward with a portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world comprised of our Monster Energy brand together with our Strategic Brands as well as Hydro, Predator and Reign. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-03 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Corporation First Quarter 2019 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Sir, you may begin. Rodney Sacks Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I’m Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President is with me today, as is Tom Kelly, our Executive Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I’d like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended and are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2019, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated May 2, 2019. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. Consumer beverage preferences and tastes continue to evolve, and we are endeavoring to address them through our ongoing innovation of new products. In the first quarter of 2019, net sales were $946 million, up 11.2% from $850.9 million in the first quarter of 2018. Net sales in the first quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $22 million of foreign currency movements. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 60.6% for both the three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018. For the quarter ended March 31, 2019, gross profit as a percentage of net sales was positively affected by increased sales prices of our product sold in North America, and to a lesser extent, product sales mix. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily negatively affected by geographical sales mix and increases in certain input costs. Distribution costs, as a percentage of net sales, were 3.8% for the 2019 first quarter as compared to 3.9% in the 2018 first quarter. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 11% for the 2019 first quarter as compared to 11.5% in the same quarter in 2018. General and administrative costs, as a percentage of net sales, were 12.9% for the 2019 first quarter as compared to 12.3% in the same quarter in 2018. In the quarter, payroll expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 7.7% compared to 7.5% in the same period in 2018. Payroll costs increased $8.6 million, primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally as well as an increase in payroll taxes. Stock-based compensation, this is a non-cash item, was $15.3 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $13.4 million in the same quarter of 2018. Our effective tax rate decreased from 23.3% in the 2018 first quarter to 16.8% in the 2019 first quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in the deductions for equity compensation as well as the increasing profits earned by certain foreign subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions than in United States. Net income was $261.5 million in the 2019 first quarter compared to net income of $216.1 million in the 2018 first quarter, an increase of 21%. Diluted earnings per share for the 2019 first quarter increased 26.7% to $0.48 from $0.38 in the first quarter of 2018. We continue to make good progress on the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers globally. In March 2019, we agreed to the assignment of the Kalil Bottling Group’s distribution territories to Coca-Cola Bottlers in the southwestern United States. We incurred no distributed termination costs and received no deferred revenue connection with this assignment. We transitioned the distribution of Monster Energy drinks from Big Geyser’s territory, which is located in the New York metro markets to Liberty Coca-Cola in early April 2019. As of April 6, 2019, the United States has been fully transitioned to all Coca-Cola network bottlers. In the second quarter 2019, Monster Energy will be launched in Azerbaijan and Saudi Arabia. We are planning further international launches later this year in EMEA. We launched Predator, our strategically preferred affordable energy brand, in Namibia and Mozambique in the first quarter of 2019. We're also planning launches of Predator in certain markets in Eastern Europe in the second quarter of 2019 as well as in selected additional markets in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa throughout the second half of 2019. We launched Monster in Bolivia in the first quarter of 2019. We also launched Monster in Paraguay last week, and anticipate launching in the Dominican Republic in the second quarter. In China, we completed the rollout of Monster Ultra in the first quarter. During the first quarter, we also began the launch of Monster Mango, which will continue throughout the second quarter of 2019. We’ve significantly expanded our shelf space for Monster with these three SKUs in our targeted top 40 cities and key accounts. We continue the rollout of Monster across India, and Monster is now available in approximately 90% of the country. We are planning additional SKU launches in India later in 2019. I'll now provide a quick update on our arbitration with The Coca-Cola Company. As we’ve stated, our various agreements with The Coca-Cola Company restrict The Coca-Cola Company from competing in the energy drink category, with certain exceptions, including an exception relating to the Coca-Cola brand. Coca-Cola has developed three energy drink product that it believes it may market under an exception, relating to the Coca-Cola brand. We believe that the exception does not apply. By mutual agreement, the issue was submitted to arbitration at the end of October 2018 for a determination of whether Coca-Cola is permitted to manufacture, market and distribute these products. The arbitration proceedings are still ongoing on the schedule the parties agreed two months ago. Monster expects a decision from the arbitrators before the end of the second quarter. Although Coca-Cola has announced it is proceeding to launch new energy drinks in certain countries without waiting for the arbitration panel to rule on the issue, Coca-Cola’s entitlement to continue to sell such drinks will be governed by the outcome of the arbitration. We reiterate that whatever the outcome of the arbitration, we will continue to cooperate and work together as partners. I also wanted to take a moment to address a matter that has received some attention. Monster's litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., VPX, the maker of Bang energy drinks. Monster filed a lawsuit against VPX in September 2018 for false advertising, including false and unsupported claims that Bang contains ingredients that it does not have and provide benefit that it does not generate. VPX has continually attempted to delay our lawsuit. In April, we filed a motion for preliminary injunction, which is scheduled for hearing in June 2019. In March 2019, VPX filed a trademark lawsuit against Monster. I have two comments to make. Firstly, the lawsuit is meritless. Months after Monster publicly announced the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel beverages in mid-January 2019, a company related to VPX allegedly purchased an unrelated Reign trademark for a different class of products, namely powered dietary supplements. Monster holds trademark and use priority over VPX for its Reign Total Body Fuel beverages in the clause that covers these beverages. We recently filed a reply to VPX’s complaint, which set forth our opposition in detail, and asserts counterclaims against VPX for trademark infringement and unfair competition. Secondly, this lawsuit will not impede or slow the launch Reign Total Body Fuel. As our litigation with VPX and the arbitration with Coca-Cola are subjudicate, we will not be answering questions on these matters on the call. According to Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks to April 20, 2019, all assets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, merchandise, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 9.8% versus the same period a year ago.

NOS’s share declined 0.5 share points to 3.7% and Full Throttle's share declined 0.2 points to 0.8%.

VPX Bang's share is 8.3% and Reign's share is 1.7%. In view of the recent launch of Reign, we're giving you an update on its performance. According to Nielsen, for the one-week ended April 20, 2019, in the convenience and gas channel, Reign's market share in dollars for the one-week is already 2.5%, while Bang’s market share in dollars in that week is 8.3%. According to Nielsen, in the four weeks ended April 20, 2019, sales of coffee plus energy drinks, which now includes Caffé Monster and Espresso Monster, in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 7.8% over the same period the previous year. Sales of our Java Monster alone were 9.1% higher than in the same period the previous year. Sales of our coffee plus energy drinks were 1.3% higher, while sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy were 9.3% higher. Our company’s share of the coffee plus energy category, which includes Java Monster, Caffé Monster, Espresso Monster, Starbucks Double Shot and Rockstar Roasted for the four weeks ended April 20, 2019, was 53.5%, down 3.5 points. Java Monster’s share on its own for the four weeks ended April 20, 2019, was 47.3%, up 0.5 of a point, while Starbucks Double Shot Energy share was 43.4%, up 0.6 of a point. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended March 30, 2019, the energy drink category increased 4% in dollars.

NOS sales increased 75.6 and its market share increased 6.1 share points to 16.8%, while Boost’s market share decreased 0.6 points to 7.7%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced, positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA, vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending January 2019, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 11.5% to 13.2% in Belgium from 25.6% to 26.4% in France, from 16% to 17.2% in Germany, from 18.7% to 20% in Great Britain, from 7% to 7.1% in the Netherlands, from 16.3% to 18.8% in Norway, from 8.3% to 12.4% in Poland, from 15.6% to 16.3% in South Africa, from 29.3% to 30.3% in Spain and from 12% to 13.2% Sweden.

According to INTAGE, in Japan, Monster’s market share in value in the convenience store channel grew from 47.9% in the 2018 first quarter to 49.3% in the first quarter of 2019. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months may often be materially influenced, positively and/or negatively, by promotions or other trading factors during those months. For the Monster Energy drinks segment in the first quarter 2019 increased 11.5% from $780.5 million to $870.4 million from the comparable period in 2018. Net sales for the month of energy drink segment in the third quarter of 2019 will negatively impacted by approximately $18.2 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment was $70.3 million for the first quarter, as compared to $65.8 million in the same quarter in 2018. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment in the first quarter of 2019 was negatively impacted by approximately $3.8 million of foreign currency movements.

Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were 284.1 million, 30% of total net sales in the 2019 first quarter from $242.1 million was 28.5% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2018. Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $22 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company military customers, which are in the U. S. and France shipped to the military and their customers overseas. In the EMEA, we had another challenging quarter with supply chain and production issues, although less than in the 2018 fourth quarter. It not only affected our sales, but also resulted in a number of out of stocks and cancellations of orders from the retail trade in certain countries in the EMEA. As mentioned earlier, our Nielsen growth rates and market share continues to be strong in the territory. We are managing through these supply chain and production issues. Certain of our core factors that contributed in part to these issues are back on track. Furthermore, we have secured and are securing additional production capacity. In EMEA, net sales in the first quarter increased 12.5% in dollars and increased 22.3% in local currencies over the same period in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 43.2%, compared to 44.5% in the same quarter in 2018. Gross profit in the region was also impacted by a high percentage of Monster sales relative to sales of concentrates of our Strategic Brand in the region. We are also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gain market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, South Africa, Spain, and Sweden. In Asia Pacific, net sales in the first quarter increased 29.6% in dollars and 34.2% in local currencies over the same in 2018. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 42.2%.

Inventories increased to $300.8 million at March 31, 2019 from $277.7 million at December 31, 2018. Average days of inventory were 72.7 days at March 31, 2019 compared to 67.2 days at December 31, 2018. We have successful launched Monster Energy Ultra Paradise a line extension in our Monster Ultra family in February 2019 as well two -- an additional two flavors of Hydro, Hydro Manic Melon and Hydro Mean Green in 25.4-ounce PET bottles. In addition, we booked out the last family in the quarter with the launch of NOS Sonic Sour and the re-branding of NOS Rowdy Punch to NOS Power Punch. We also extended the Java Monster Swiss Chocolate lead launch from 2018 to all customers in February 2019 and added two flavors in our Dragon Tea line Green Tea and Yerba Mate which launched in March. We have repositioned our Monster Rehab White Dragon Tea to be included in the new Monster Dragon Tea line. Finally in March, we launched Reign Total Body Fuel in six flavors, initial results have been positive. During January 2019 in Canada, we launched two additional line extensions of Monster Hydro, namely Purple Fashion and Zero Sugar, as well as Monster White Dragon Tea. In March, we launched our Caffé Monster line in 13.7-ounce re-sealable glass package. In Mexico, we launched Mango Loco in April 2019. During the first quarter of 2019 we launched Pacific Punch in the Caribbean and extended our range in Puerto Rico. In Chile, during the first quarter of 2019, we launched Monster Absolutely Zero. In Argentina, we launched Monster Ultra. The initial results have been positive. In the first quarter of 2019, we launched Monster Mango Loco in Norway, the Netherlands, Poland, Italy and the Baltics. Monster Mango Loco will be launched in another 12 EMEA markets in the second quarter 2019. Monster Pipeline Punch was launched in Ireland. We also launched Espresso Monster and Espresso Monster Vanilla in Germany and Spain. We are planning to continue to rollout of our Espresso Monster line across Western Europe in the second quarter of 2019. We launched Black Monster Ultra in Russia in the first quarter of 2019 and continued the rollout of additional SKUs in the Monster Ultra range in EMEA markets, specifically in Monster ultra blue and gray Brazil in Ireland and Monster Ultra Violet in the Baltics in the first quarter of 2019. There is SKUs in the Monster Ultra line 39 EMEA markets. In Australia we successfully launched the new flavor across in February with good initial results. We launched Monster Mango in China in March and continue with our rollout of Monster Ultra. We plan to launch a number of products in Asia Pacific later this year. As I mentioned earlier, we implemented a price increase of approximately 4% on our Monster Energy portfolio to our used customers effective November 1, 2018. We are satisfied with the initial results for the implementation of this price increase. For Monster expenses as percentage of gross sales decreased in the first quarter of 2019. We increased the prices of our concentrate for NOS and Full Throttle effective January 1 2019 by approximately 1.5%. We also implemented a price increase of approximately 3% to our Canadian customers effective February 1, 2019 for the Monster Energy NOS and Full Throttle lines. We estimate April 2019 gross sales to be approximately 15.6% higher than in April 2018. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis April 2019 gross sales would have been approximately 18.9% higher than comparable April 2018 gross sales. It was one more selling day in April 2019 than in April 2018. In this regard we cautioned the guiding that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors. Such as for example selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and for promotional retail stores. Distributing incentives as well as shift in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules which affects the day which we such bottlers as very inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even two months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. During the 2019 first quarter, the company purchased approximately 2.6 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $54.18 per share for a total of $139 million excluding broker commissions. As of May 2, 2019 approximately $520.6 million remains available for repurchase under our previously-authorized repurchase program. In conclusion I'd like to summarize a recent positive points. One, retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the Energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in line with earlier periods. Two, the new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company sales. Three, we are excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches. Four, in particular initial results for our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks which launched in March are positive and we are encouraged by the prospect for this line. Five, we are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. Six, we're continuing with our plans to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain new markets. Seven, we're also proceeding with our plans for future launches of our affordable energy brands internationally and also evaluating the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in countries outside of the USA in the second half of 2019. I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Stephen Powers: Hey, guys. Thanks. I guess, it's worth asking about, but I guess maybe just start on your thoughts on U.S. pricing relative to the competition. And now that you've got your innovation out in the marketplace, should we expect to see incremental promotional dollars allocated to those initiatives? And I guess, how much do you think those initiatives will be allocated against Reign versus against the base Monster franchise? I guess, what I'm really asking about is, how much if at all do you think incremental promotional investment is likely to offset the list price increases you took late last year as you go forward throughout the balance of 2019?
Rodney Sacks: Okay. Steve you will see that in this quarter when results that we actually improved promotional allowances in this quarter. So the promotional allowances are reducing. However in the next quarter we're planning and this is really planned, nothing to do with any sales or sales mixes, but we had already planned a BOGO which is a buy one get one ready to get Reign exuviated more intensively than it was in the -- with the launches. Part of the launching plan and you will see that happen in the second quarter. Apart from anything else, we are watching the market. We're watching Red Bull's crossing very carefully. And we'll make adjustments if we think it will have a long-term impact. However, what we see and you'll see that as well is the majority of Red Bull's growth is actually coming from innovation.
Stephen Powers: Okay. Great. So just a follow-up quickly. The big incremental innovation is tied to the launch of Reign which I think makes sense. And then now you have Ultra Paradise and some of your newer Monster SKUs in the marketplace. Any incremental promotion? It sounds like from your -- from what you just said, we should assume goes to those new innovations as opposed to -- against the base SKUs. Is that a fair way to think about it?
Rodney Sacks: I'm not sure I said that. When we promote Monster, we promote the line. But what I did say was that with regard to Reign, you'll see a special promotion in the ensuing quarter which will be due to a previously planned BOGO which is buy one get one to really kickstart the launch of Reign.
Stephen Powers: Perfect. Okay.
Rodney Sacks: During the quarter we will be -- we had some timing differences on our promotions last year in the first quarter where we didn't have the same depth of promotion this year. But going into the second quarter, we will be promoting Monster pretty much in accordance with the normal promotional schedule that we plan for summer.
Tom Kelly: I think Steve Kristen was -- because of the pricing the increased pricing it will be more access of coming on through this Monster.
Rodney Sacks: Correct.
Stephen Powers: Yes. Okay. That's clear. Thanks guys.
Rodney Sacks: Yes. Okay.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Judy Hong: Thank you. Hi, everyone.
Rodney Sacks: Hi, Judy.
Judy Hong: I guess, I wanted to ask about Reign more specifically whether or how much it contributed to 1Q sales as well as the April sales, because obviously there is a pretty big divergence in terms of the Nielsen numbers and your reported numbers? And then I guess more broadly on Reign, can maybe just talk a little bit more about the performance of the brand so far? How much do you think it take your share away from Bang versus maybe expanding the category? Or how much is sort of cannibalizing your brands? And how quickly do you think that we can to full distribution?
Rodney Sacks: On the contribution of Reign, Reign contributed about $25.5 million of sales to the first quarter.
Tom Kelly: Net sales.
Rodney Sacks: Net sales. Yes. We don't have the -- we're not going to go into the number in April that's just a -- we give the gross numbers as opposed to breaking that up. And I think Judy to answer the balance of your question I think it's just too early for us to tell exactly what is taking from what. You can see the numbers from Nielsen has been some affected since. Obviously, there is a new entrant and participant in the category. It's taking share from all the products. But ultimately we do believe that Reign will continue to increase itself and establish itself that is the reason why we're actually looking at the first promotion we got with Reign. It hasn't been promoted until now. And so you got to get the first promotion coming through in the second quarter on Reign. And we will continue to pull out. We did get some pretty good distribution initially from the Coke bottlers, but it will continue to hold out as we go into the second quarter.
Judy Hong: Thank you.
Tom Kelly: Just to add to that Judy, it’s really the launch exceeded our expectation.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Mark Astrachan: Hey, afternoon guys.
Rodney Sacks: Hi, Mark.
Mark Astrachan: I wanted to ask a question on white space and opportunity for products. So you commented on Ultra being available in I think 38 EMEA markets. It got me thinking so, how do you think about U.S. innovation in terms of what the white space would be for existing franchises as well as just new franchises where you're putting the stuff on shelves. Meaning, it seems like Reign is getting on the new shelf. Is that fair? How do you think about the existing energy shelves? And then outside of the U.S., how do you think about taking successful innovation like Hydro, Java and taking it global. Where are you in the rollout of SKUs versus where it would be? Obviously, there is a lot of that and still maybe just kind of broader strokes of how you think about what the opportunity can be. I think that would be helpful.
Rodney Sacks: I think you mentioned this Mark on previous calls, where the determination is made together with the local management about -- in each country thought which SKUs we should launch, which SKUs are appropriate to the consumer needs in that country. And there is a rollout which is dependent on opportunities and you've seen we've done that. I mean, on this call we mentioned a number of countries where we have launched additional SKUs. And we will continue to do so. But one thing we will not do is roll out all our SKUs in all our countries, because that's not a good approach to addressing the market. In China, for example, we already have three SKUs. We have the original Monster. We have Ultra. And we have Mango. So we have three SKUs now in China. And if you look at other countries we success for the -- and success we’ve done that. In EMEA, we've done that and we continuing to do that.
Tom Kelly: In most of these countries, we really are -- there isn't a cookie cutter sort of formula. We look at the countries. We obviously try and launch with Monster Green to establish the Monster brand, because that's what it's stands for. But from then on we look at the individual countries. They flavor preferences, and you'll find that our second or third SKU many countries differ from country-to-country. And then depending on the response we get. In some countries, we get really good response to Ultra. We then change the track and basically start to launch more of the Ultra product. And perhaps some years ago, we were launching more of the juice product. And so the order is changed a little bit. Mango has got very well received. Popcorn is being very well received. And so we really elevated those SKUs basically looking in some countries. There are some countries where we are finding directly there is a good reception to our Rehab line. Now Rehab, it may not go into that format. It may go in the form of a tea likers. Rehab has less meaning in foreign countries than it has in the U.S. because of the origin of Rehab. But there is some opportunities for tea lines in some countries and we are looking at that into non-core. And as you've been seen we have taken the step also some testing to look at coffee. In Europe we think that market is -- we're going to expand that market with Espresso. And we're also looking at some other potential coffee products into the UK market. Again looking at shelves and keeping abreast of growth and innovation. In those markets, we do see good opportunities for that. And once we look at that, and again reach the right progression in other countries we will look at other growth opportunities in -- but we're going to follow our policy of looking at it country-by-country as we have launched in the country as the bottle is able to handle it and we feel it's right to continue to grow. That we'll continue to build out over years our portfolio is going to continue to grow, continue to build out internationally. In the U.S., while we've launched, we believe there is -- the energy shelf is pretty impacted at the moment. So we're looking to get new space for this high-performance category incremental. In some cases in order to -- because of timing and because of reset in order to get products on shelf, it has been put onto the energy shelf. But in many cases, we are achieving additional space and we also have -- we believe most of the retailers are agreed that there should be additional space allocated to this high-performance category. It is a profitable category for the retailers. It's a high ring. And so we believe we will see additional space being allocated to energy basically to accommodate the new high-performance products that we believe we will end up with -- overall end up with increased shelf space.
Rodney Sacks: And Mark, to reinforce that earlier comment that certain flavor profiles that do really well overseas and don't do well in the U.S. For example, one of my favorite Monster products is the Ultra Citron. And a decision was taken that we would probably should discontinue it in favor of other Ultra products. And that Ultra Citron has been launched in the bunch of international countries Japan, Korea and a bunch of countries across Europe because of its less sweet profile. So each country will determine -- with obviously with direction from the Senate, the product that best suit the consumer needs in those countries.
Tom Kelly: Just to add, I think it hasn't been launched yet in Japan or Korea.
Mark Astrachan: Thank you.
Tom Kelly: It has.
Rodney Sacks: Between us they are not certain with…
Tom Kelly: I believe it has. Yes.
Rodney Sacks: Okay.
Tom Kelly: And again…
Rodney Sacks: Yes.
Tom Kelly: The concept that a major product that will see in other countries that we may not even launch in the U.S. or they may launch in, they just -- we discontinued in the U.S.
Rodney Sacks: Yes, agreed.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Amit Sharma: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.
Rodney Sacks: Hi.
Amit Sharma: Rodney if we take Reign out from Q1 sales and look at the rest of the US portfolio around 4.2 - growth, all right. And most of that coming from pricing? And you talked about that you will watch Red Bull price like at what point do you get worried about the volume performance of the core Monster brand in U.S. and not just price accordingly?
Rodney Sacks: I think we've got a whole beverage portfolio. And you're going to take the portfolio as a whole in time. I think that we did mention I think earlier that for timing reasons they were certain promotions that we've done last year that fairly to earlier periods where we had some Nielsen updates that didn't get repeated this year. They are falling into -- probably into the second quarter now. So we – overall, we are comfortable with the brands. There is a sort of change going on in the industry at the moment. There's a change in – obviously, finding shelf space, people are trying some of these new high-performance drinks. We think a lot of that will stop. The noise will stop settling down. We think there will be growth. Overall, we're still -- we're comfortable with our innovation. Ultra Paradise is now got on to shelves and is really doing well. Innovation in coffee. The Swiss coffee is doing well. We have additional innovation planned in the months to line later in the year. And so we are comfortable that overall we will continue to grow.
Tom Kelly: Yes. Amit just remember that our launches took place February the 21st for Hydro. So there's two new flavors in seven 50. For Java the Swiss Chocolate; for Ultra Paradise, last Snapple that is all February the 21st. And in March the 21st, we had Reign and we had Dragon Tea. So the launches took place really towards the end of the quarter. And -- but as I said earlier, we will be monitoring Red Bull and we'll take whatever steps necessary to ensure that the business continues to grow.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open.
Laurent Grandet: Yes. Good evening Rodney and Hilton. Congrats on a strong quarter. I would try to have a second shot at Crane, because we don't have so much, I mean, Nielsen reliable numbers for now. So I think you said Reign was representing about 2.5% in the last week of April when Bang was about 8.3% I guess…
Rodney Sacks: Correct.
Laurent Grandet: Yes. That's correct, yes. So it seems like
Rodney Sacks: The Market share yes.
Tom Kelly: Market share in convenience.
Laurent Grandet: Market share, yes, in market share. So it seems like since you had those two, it feels like a 23% of the new – rain represent about 22% of the new category. That's a great result just after six-week especially as you are roughly in just half of those stores, Bang is available and why you can't? So do you have any qualitative feedback at least from retailer in terms of sales especially in stores that sell Boost, Bang and Reign that you could share with us that would be helpful? Thank you.
Rodney Sacks: Well, we've got some information from some of our major convenience retail partners on SKUs – competitive SKUs. And they are trending by and large at a higher percentage than is shown in the Nielsen numbers. But because of the fact that we bought and it's not something that we generally go into and verify as carefully, we don't want to quote them on this call. But we do -- the numbers we are seeing out of the top change is showing a higher comparable number, which is positive for us and I think we just got to be a bit patient and wait for the numbers to start coming through generally. And then we'll start seeing the south point as well as the distribution overall.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Rodney for any closing remarks.
Rodney Sacks: On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. Any particular spend distribution of our product through the Coca-Cola Bottlers system international. We are also particularly excited about new opportunities that we have going forward with a portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world, comprised of our Monster Energy brand together with our strategic brands as well as Hydro, Mutant, Predator and Reign. Thank you very much for your attention and attendance.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude today's program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-27 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for your patience. You have joined Monster Beverage Corporation's 2018 Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference may be recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Chairman and CEO, Mr. Rodney Sacks. Sir, you may begin.
Rodney Sacks: Hi, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I am Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our last Vice Chairman and President is with me today, as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I'd like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2018, and our Form 10-Q filed on August 9, 2018, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements for discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures which may be mentioned during the course of this call is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated February 27, 2019. A copy of this information is also available on our Web site at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. Consumer beverage preferences and tastes are continuing to evolve, and we are endeavoring to address them through our ongoing innovation of new products. Net sales for the 2018 fourth quarter were negatively impacted by $8.5 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606. Under ASC 606, commissions paid to The Coca-Cola Company based on our sales to certain of the company's customers, which The Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method or consolidates, are now included as a reduction to net sales. Whereas, prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers, which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method, were included in operating expenses. Net and gross sales for the three months ended December 31 2018, were negatively impacted by advanced purchases made by our customers in the third quarter of 2018 due to a pre-announced price increase effective November 1, 2018, on certain of our Monster Energy brand Energy Drinks in 2018 which affected our fourth quarter. The company estimates such impact to net and gross sales was approximately $16 million and $18 million, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2018, net sales were $924.2 million, up 14.1%, from $810.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 15.1%. Net sales in the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $14.4 million of foreign currency movements. The company recorded fourth quarter gross sales of $1.06 billion, up 13.7%, from $934.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $16.2 million of foreign currency movements. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, for the 2018 fourth quarter was 59.7%, compared with 62.1% in the 2017 fourth quarter. The gross profit percentage, as adjusted for ASC 606, would have been 60.1% for the quarter. The decrease in gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was primarily attributable to increases in certain import costs such as aluminum cans, freight in and other input costs, geographical sales mix as a result of our international sales increasing as a percentage of total net sales, our foreign operations generally have lower gross margins. Domestic product sales mix and the $8.5 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by increases in domestic sales process as well as the decrease in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.7% for the 2018 fourth quarter as compared to 3.6% in the 2017 fourth quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.3% for the 2018 fourth quarter as compared to 13.6% in the same quarter in 2017. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.5% for the 2018 fourth quarter as compared to 11.9% in the same quarter in 2017. In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales were 7.2% compared to 7.7% in the same period in 2017. Payroll costs increased $4.9 million, primarily due to headcount growth both domestically and internationally. Stock-based compensation and non-cash item was $14.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $13 million in the same quarter in 2017. Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China of $3.1 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rates decreased from 24.8% in the 2017 fourth quarter to 23.1% in the 2018 fourth quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the reduction in the U. S. Federal Statutory tax rate as a result of The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act with The Tax Reform Act signed into law on December 22, 2017 as well as a reduction in certain foreign income that is subject to U.S. taxation. In addition, the comparative 2017 fourth quarter effective tax rate included a one-time provisional charge related to the revaluation of the company's deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017, and a one-time charge for the deemed mandatory repatriation of post 1986 earnings and profits as a result of The Tax Reform Act. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was also partially offset by a decrease in the stock-based compensation tax deduction. Net income was $239.1 million in the 2018 fourth quarter, compared to net income of $201.3 million in the 2017 fourth quarter, an increase of 18.8%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from $575 million for the fourth quarter 2017 to $556.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2018, as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call. Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 fourth quarter increased 22.7% to $0.43, from $0.35 in the fourth quarter of 2017. We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coco-Cola bottlers globally. We're also making good progress in the U.S. in non-traditional channels including foodservice accounts, e-commerce, and home improvement stores. In the second quarter of 2019, Monster Energy will be launched in Azerbaijan and Saudi Arabia. We are planning further international launches later this year in EMEA. We launched Predator, our strategically-preferred affordable energy brand in South Africa in the fourth quarter, and plan to launch in certain surrounding countries in the first quarter of 2019. We're also planning launches of Predator in selected additional markets in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East, and Africa throughout 2019. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched Monster in Ecuador. We are now in track to launch Monster in Bolivia in the first quarter of 2019. We're planning to launch Monster in the Dominican Republic and Paraguay in the second quarter of 2019. In China, we had a limited launch of Monster Ultra Light in the fourth quarter to further appeal to Monster's primary target of young affluent consumers. Ultra's innovation has facilitated expanded shelf space in the targeted top 40 cities and key accounts. We are continuing to expand the rollout of Monster Ultra this quarter and are planning further innovation through the launch of Mango Loco in China during the second quarter of 2019. We continue the rollout of Monster across India with expansion to top 50 cities. Monster is now selling in approximately 90% of the country with marketing initiatives now in full swing. I wanted to take a moment to address an issue previously covered on our law school, and that's our Investor Presentation in New York in January concerning our arbitration with The Coco-Cola Company. As we reported, our various agreements with The Coco-Coal Company restrict the Coco-Cola Company from competing in the Energy Drink category with certain exceptions. Coco-Cola has developed three energy products that it believes it may market under an exception relating to the Coco-Cola brand. We believe that the exception does not apply to those energy products. As a result, we have a disagreement with Coco-Cola over the interpretation of that exception. By mutual agreement to obtain clarification, the issue was submitted to arbitration at the end of October 2018, and that process is underway with the parties participating cooperatively. Coco-Cola has indicated that it has suspended the proposed launch of its proposed energy products until April 2019. We cannot predict the certainty when the result of the arbitration will be published, but reasonably expect the resolution of the issue in the second quarter of 2019. We reiterate that whatever the outcome of the arbitration, we will continue to cooperate and work together as partners. According to the Nielsen Reports for the 13-week through January 26, 2019, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the Energy Drink category including Energy Shots increased by 11.3% versus the same period a year ago.

Sales of 5-Hour decreased 2.1%, and sales of Amp decreased 31%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended January 26, 2019 sales in the convenience and gas channel including Energy Shots in dollars increased 13% over the same period the previous year, sales of Monster increased by 10.8% over the same period. The previous year while NOS was up 3.6%. And Full Throttle was up 4.9%. Sales of Red Bull up 11.7%, Rockstar was down 4.8%, 5-Hour down 0.12% and AMP was down 33.6%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended January 26, 2019, Monster's market share the Energy Drink category in the convenience and gas channel including Energy Shots in dollars decreased by .7 share point over the same period last year to 37.1%. NOS's share declined 0.4 share point to 3.9% and Full Throttle's share declined 0.1 share point to 0.9%. Red Bull share decreased 0.4 point to 33.7%. Rockstar share was down 1.2 points to 6.4%, 5-Hour share was lowered by 0.8 points at 6.2%, and Amp's share decreased 0.4 point to 0.6% and is 4.9% up 4.3 share points. According to Nielsen, in the four weeks ended January 26, 2019, sales of coffee plus Energy Drinks, which now include Caffe Monster and Espresso Monster in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 21% over the same period previous year. Sales of our Java Monster alone was 15.5% higher than in the same period the previous year. Sales of coffee plus energy were 29.2% higher while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 11.7% higher. Our company share of the coffee plus energy category, which includes Java Monster, Caffe Monster, Espresso Monster, Starbucks Doubleshot and Rockstar Roasted for the four weeks ended January 26, 2019, was 58%, up 3.7 points. Java Monster's share on its own for the four weeks ended January 26, 2019, was 50.1%, down 2.4 points, while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy share was 41.9%, down 3.5 points. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended February 02, 2019, the Energy Drink category increased 7% in dollars. Monster sales increased 13% versus a year ago. Monster's market share increased 2.1 share points to 34.5%. NOS's sales increased 1%, and its market share decreased 0.1 share point to 3%. Full Throttle's sales increased 1% and its market share decreased 0.1 points to 1.5%. Red Bull's sales increased 7% and its market share increased 0.4 point to 36.2%. Rockstar's sales decreased 6% and its market share decreased 2.6 points to 15.4%. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the Energy Drink category grew 12.9% during the month of January 2019. Monster sales increased 8.3%. Our market share in value decreased 1.3 points to 13.5% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Burn were down 18.6%. Burn's market share decreased 0.5 points to 1.2%. Red Bull's sales decreased 5% and its market share decreased by 1.9 points to 9.9%.

The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO Convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO Convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more Energy Drinks brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. I'd like to point out that Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending January 2019, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 11% to 12.7% in Belgium; from 24.3% to 24.8% in France; from 18.8% to 20.3% in Great Britain; from 7.1% to 7.3% in the Netherlands; from 28.9% to 13.3% in Spain.

According to INTAGE, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 44.4% in the 2017 fourth quarter to 46.7% in the fourth quarter of 2018. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those months. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 15.9% from $736.1 million to $853.3 million from the comparable period in 2017. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the 2018 fourth quarter were negatively impacted by $3.2 million due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment would have been 16.4%. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the fourth quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by approximately $12.4 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $65.8 million for the fourth quarter, as compared to $69.6 million in the same quarter in 2017. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment for the fourth quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by $5.3 million due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in sales for the Strategic Brands segment would have been 2.3%. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment in the fourth quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by approximately $2 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF were $5.1 million in the fourth quarter, as compared to $4.7 million in the same quarter in 2017. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $274.3 million in the 2018 fourth quarter, compared to $210.4 million in the corresponding quarter in 2017. Foreign exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $14.4 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and trans-shipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA, we had a challenging quarter with supply chain and production issues, although less than in the 2018 third quarter, which not only affected our sales, but also resulted in a number of out-of-stocks and cancellations of orders from the retail trade in certain countries in EMEA. As mentioned earlier, our Nielsen growth rates and market share continues to be strong in the territory. We are managing through the supply chain and production issues. Certain of our cofactors that contributed in part to these issues are back on track. Furthermore we have secured and are securing additional production capacity. In EMEA, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 18.9% in dollars, and increased 23.2% in local currencies over the same period in 201. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 23.8% in dollars and 28.1% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 42.1%, compared to 47.5% in the same quarter in 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 44.4% for the fourth quarter. Gross profit in the region was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales, relative to sales of concentrates for our Strategic Brands in the region. We are pleased with the rollout of additional SKUs in the Ultra range in the EMEA markets. Various SKUs in the Ultra line are now sold in 38 EMEA markets.  We are also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gain market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, South Africa, Spain, and Sweden. In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 68.4% in dollars and 73.5% in local currencies over the same period in 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 70% in dollars and 75.1% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 46.1% versus 32.4% over the same period in 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 46.6%. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 55.1% in dollars and 55.8% in local currency. In South Korea, net sales increased 141.6% in dollars and 142.6% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter in 2017.

Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 45.3% in dollars and 66.1% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 44.7% versus 47.1% over the same period in 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 45.3%. Net sales in Brazil in the quarter increased by 30.3% in dollars and 58.7% in local currency; net sales in Chile increased 48.6% in dollars and 60.9% in local currency in the quarter. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $637.5 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $528.6 million at December 31, 2017. Short-term investments were $320.7 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $672.9 million at December 31, 2017. Net accounts receivable increased to $484.6 million at December 31, 2018, from $449.5 million at December 31, 2017. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 41.4 days at December 31, 2018, compared to 43.8 days at December 31, 2017. Inventories increased to $277.7 million from $255.7 million at December 31, 2017. Average days of inventory were 67.2 days at December 31, 2018, compared to 75 days at December 31, 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched Java Swiss Chocolate, a line extension of our Java Monster family as an exclusive launch for certain customers, and are now in the prices of national launch of Java Swiss Chocolate. Initial results have been positive. We are currently in the process of launching Ultra Paradox, a line extension in our Ultra family, as well as Hydro Manic Melon and Hydro Mean Green in 25.4 ounce PET bottles. In addition, we are currently launching NOS Sonic Sour, a new flavor in the NOS family, as well as rebranding NOS Rowdy Punch to NOS Power Punch. In March, we are planning to launch our Reign Total Body Fuel in six flavors. We are also planning on launching two flavors in our Dragon Tea line in March, namely Green Tea and [indiscernible] Marty. We have repositioned our Monster Rehab White Dragon Tea to be included in the new Monster Dragon Tea line as white tea. During January 2019, in Canada we launched two additional line extensions of Monster Hydro namely Purple Passion and Zero Sugar, as well as Monster White Dragon Tea. In March of 2019, we are planning on launching three flavors of our café Monster line in the 13.7 ounce gloss package in Canada. In Mexico, during the fourth quarter of 2018 we launched our Lewis Hamilton Energy Drink. Initial results have been positive. We are planning on launching Monster Mango Loco this quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2108, we launched Monster Mango Loco in Belgium, Ireland, and South Africa. Mango Loco will be widely available across Europe in the first-half of 2019. Monster Mega was launched in the Adriatics. We also launched Espresso Monster and Espresso Monster Vanilla in selected accounts in Great Britain. Espresso Monster is also just launched in Germany this month. We are planning to launch our Espresso Monster line across Western Europe in the first-half of 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched Burn Lemonades in Russia, VPM Orange Zero in Ireland, Power Play Mango in South Africa, and Burn Mango in the Baltics. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we executed a limited launch of Monster Energy Pipeline Punch with a convenience and gas retailer in Australia. In January of 2019, we distributed Monster Energy Pipeline Punch nationally. In the fourth quarter of 2018 in New Zealand, we launched Pipeline Punch and Mango Loco market-wide. We have experienced manufacturing issues relating to Mango Loco product in Australia. We anticipating that we'll be able to resolve these issues and resume product supply to both Australia and New Zealand in the second quarter and re-launch at retail in the third quarter of 2019. As I mentioned earlier, we implemented price increase of approximately 4% on our Monster Energy portfolio to our U.S. customers effective November 1, 2018. We are pleased with the initial results of the implementation of this price increase. Promotional expenses as a percentage of gross sales decreased in the quarter. We increased the prices of our concentrates for NOS and Full Throttle effective January 1, 2019 by approximately 1.5%. We also implemented a cost increase of approximately 3% to our Canadian customers effective February 1, 2019 for Monster Energy NOS and Full Throttle lines. We estimate that January 2019 gross sales to be approximately 2.7% higher than January 2018. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, January 2019 gross sales would have been approximately 4.6% higher in comparable January 2018 gross sales. In this regard, we note and as explained on our fourth quarter 2017 call that the increase in gross sales of 27.9% in January 2018 as compared to January 2017, ForEx adjusted to 25.1%, was in part due to the increase in January 2018 sales, following inventory reductions that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017 by certain of our international distributors; (B) Initial shipments of Caffé Monster and Muscle Monster, which we launched in January 2018; and (C) Moreover innovation in 2017 had a more substantial impact on January 2018 sales than innovation in 2018 has had on our January 2019 sales. No new innovation was launched by us in the U.S. in January 2019. This year our innovation in the U.S. namely Monster Ultra Paradox and Java Monster Swiss Chocolate is being launched nationally this week, and Reign and two additional varieties of Monster Dragon Tea will be launched in March. The increase in January 2019 sales over January 2018 sales mentioned about should be evaluated in the context of the above factors that impacted January 2018 sales. In this regard, we are cautioned again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor in terms of what's shipped in the timing of production, and this is where our bottles are responsible for production, and will accurately determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained via distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short-term such as a single month or even two months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. During the 2018 fourth quarter, the company purchased approximately 9.4 million shares of common stock, at an average purchase price of 56.99 per share for a total of $536.9 million excluding broker commissions. Between January 1, 2019 and February 26, 2019, the company purchased approximately 2.6 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $54.18 per share for a total of $139 million excluding broker commissions. As of February 26, 2019, approximately 20.6 million remains available for repurchase under our previously authorized repurchase program. On February 26, 2019, the company's board of directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional 500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. In conclusion, I'd like to say summarize some recent positive points. Retail sales statistics for many countries around the world demonstrated that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in line with earlier periods. The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We are excited about the prospects for our brand and our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets, and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. We are continuing with our plans to launch Monster energy drinks with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain new markets. We're also proceeding with our plans for future launches of our affordable energy brands. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and year-end, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of Macquarie. Your line is open.
Caroline Levy: Thank you very much, good afternoon.
Rodney Sacks: Hi, Caroline.
Caroline Levy: Hi, Rodney. Just a quick question on -- a clarification if you could repeat the January sales, that would be helpful. I think I heard 2% and 4%, but just want to clarify. And then if you could just tell us a little bit more about how things are going in China. You mentioned about $3 million in losses in the quarter, how does that progress over the course of last year? Are the losses about where you expected them to be, do you think we will have another lost year next year and how do you feel about the progress in China overall?
Hilton Schlosberg: Okay. Let's just deal with the January sales. January sales were up -- sorry, 2.7% in January and on a foreign currency adjusted basis 4.6%.
Rodney Sacks: So Caroline, you got the point about January '18 sales being higher than ordinarily they should have been. So we spent a bit of time just talking about that.
Caroline Levy: Yes.
Rodney Sacks: Go back to the same call we had a year ago and pick up some of those sentiments that we expressed exactly the same at that time.
Caroline Levy: Okay. Oh, got it.
Rodney Sacks: And I think obviously -- and then taking that into account, we have obviously also given you the Nielsen numbers for January and you obviously February, so we do caution about this being a single month on a highly stacked January from last year. Thanks.
Hilton Schlosberg: So Caroline, just talking very briefly about China, the loss for the quarter was very much in line with what we'd expected. We are seeing a lot of what we call green shoots in China in the major chains, our volumes per outlet are very respectable compared to what we've seen for Red Bull. And the launch of Ultra was particularly pleasing and it's growing in strength. As regards this year, we again are adjusting for a loss in China and we absolutely committed to success in that territory. So we know it'll be an investment and we know it'll take some time to realize profitability in China and our co-colleagues have expressed and shared with us similar sentiments, but we are committed and we would believe that we will be successful in China.
Rodney Sacks:
e :
Hilton Schlosberg: And just to add that the bottlers, likewise, are excited about the opportunities that the Monster brand presents for them in China.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Your line is open.
Mark Astrachan: Hey, hey guys.
Rodney Sacks: Hello, Mark, hi.
Mark Astrachan: So I guess, maybe one question broadly on gross margins. I don't want to ask you for guidance or anything like that, Hilton, but I guess, the numbers were still a little bit weaker than we or probably others would've expected. So how much of it is aluminum? I mean, I get the freight piece, I think most of it will get the freight piece, but what we don't see is how much inventory for aluminum you bought in 2008 potentially at much higher prices. So maybe if you could talk a bit about the cadence of that kind of cycling through and when kind of directionally some of that should lessen so without actually getting guidance, but just in terms of the inputs, puts and takes to how long before you start seeing lower price inventory kind of work through would be helpful.
Hilton Schlosberg: Well, you know, as we look at aluminum, aluminum did start coming down to us a ladder quarter of last year. We from time to time execute hedges with our aluminum can companies and we had some hedges in place for the fourth quarter of last year ready to protect ourselves against Aluminum going significantly up as it had been for most of the year. So that's the picture of aluminum. Aluminum coming down, re-buying it at various processing, including one of our hedges hitting in at a higher price than the market price for a portion; not for all, but for a portion of our Aluminum. So as we head into 2019, Aluminum in our books would definitely start coming down. By how much I really can't say, and I'm not at liberty to say, but it will be coming down in 2019. 
Operator: Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good afternoon. Hi. I appreciated your updates on the price increase internationally, and you mentioned Canada up 3% starting on February 1st. Do you think I'm just laying your comments before that your price, respect for your price elasticity in some places. So do you think we should be thinking of that being the last price increase so far given what Hilton just said about aluminum potentially coming down, or is that…
Rodney Sacks: No, I think that there are some selected countries in EMEA where we are we have taken certain price increases, and will continue to take some price increases this year. But I just don't have a list of them with me and at this point we wouldn't like to expand further on that. So there will be some. But obviously, we will also take that into account when we look at the Aluminum prices in what it costs us going forward. 
Operator: Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma of BMO Capital Markets. Your question please.
Amit Sharma: Hi, good afternoon everyone.
Rodney Sacks: Hi.
Amit Sharma: A quick clarification, and then a question on -- from a EMEA -- the supply chain disruptions and production issues, how much did it cost in terms of your sales growth for that segment, right, in the quarter. And then, as we think about the gross margin in U.S., it's clearly a little bit weaker than what we were expecting, and I hear your point on the commodity, but there's also a sales mix aspect of it. Can you unpack that a little bit, provide us some clarity that how much of a headwind that is, and how it could continue even after you overcome the commodity headwinds?
Rodney Sacks: Okay. So regarding EMEA, it's not a precise science, and unfortunately, I just don't want to give you a number for what the impact of these supply chain issues in EMEA were in the fourth quarter. We have made some stabs at the number. We've been reviewing it continuously since the middle of 2018, but I'd rather just stay away from giving some indication of what that number is. I don't think it would be appropriate to do so. But what I can say to you is that we believe the number was in excess of a million cases, and I'm going to stop there in the fourth quarter.
Amit Sharma: Got it. Perfect, thank you. And then gross profit impact from sales mix in U.S?
Rodney Sacks: So there definitely is an impact on sales in the U.S., and if you what we try to do is on the call is prioritize the reasons for the decrease in gross profit and you'll notice from the call that number one was the increases in certain input costs such as aluminum cans, freight in and other input costs. Secondly was our geographic sales mix, where our International sales are increasing as a percentage of our total sales and our foreign operations generally have lower gross margins as you heard on the call. And the third reason was the domestic product sales mix. So, while it was definitely a factor and will continue to be a factor with the different products that the company has launched, but in the fourth quarter, it was the number, the third reason and was not the first or the second reason. And I'd also like to stop there because when you look at our new products that will be rolled out this year particularly the new Ultra Paradise and the Reign products they will all be at the more traditional launch the margins and not at the coffee margins. So they will be higher than the coffee margins.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Guggenheim. Your line is open.
Laurent Grandet: Yes, good afternoon Rodney and Hilton. I do have a question on Reign. I noticed on the packaging doesn't carry any reference to Monster the clue or even on the back it says I mean the company manufacturing it is the Reign beverage company, so I'm curious to understand why you are not leveraging your brand name as it would be a bit more A&M intensive to launch a new brand from scratch, I'd like to understand also the first reaction from the trade on the Reign?
Rodney Sacks: Well, let me just talk about that. We the positioning of Reign is different to the positioning of Monster and we've made the strategic decision to not in fact make Reign a line extension of Monster. It needs to we think it should be positioned have its own positioning, its own marketing, create its own personality and that we believe will give its best chance of success. We already have an extensive range of products in Monster that appeal to consumers. They have their own personality and identity. So we just felt that this was the appropriate thing for us to do. This doesn't mean that in the future depending on this performance category, its longevity and the size that it grows to what we believe it will expand the energy category. What it does, we will look to what we want to do in the Monster range. There is no limitation on us in having line extensions or maybe a subfamily of products in this performance energy range with BCAAs or whatever else we want to do with a sort of a slightly different energy formula formulation. And that's something that we're looking at and open to doing, so that doesn't preclude us. We just feel that and in fact it's better. And it does enable us to position the brands differently and get more shelf space. We think that would have been more pressure on our existing shelf space had we simply launched line extensions and we do have a number of additional line extensions which we are planning for months that we've already described a number of them to you that are being launched. We actually have additional launches and sub launches planned for Monster later in the year. So we've got quite a full plate for Monster and you can't do everything under one brand and that's the reason that we've positioned it as we have.
Hilton Schlosberg: And I think it's also important to note that we're continuing with rollouts of Friends under the strategic brands and new flavors. So we're not neglecting the strategic brand segment either.
Rodney Sacks: Just as regard to retailers again, where it's being rolled out in March. So it's premature but the acceptance from retailers and to the brand to the positioning to the taste profile that we've done in the packaging has been very positive. We're actually very happy with it and we are going to have a focused and concerted rollout in March.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your question please?
Kevin Grundy: Thanks. Good afternoon.
Rodney Sacks: Hi, good afternoon Kevin.
Kevin Grundy: Quick cleanup question I hope, I know your inclination and the pension historically has not been to guide but Hilton can you just confirm for us that given the moving parts and you understand the comments are in input cost and mix and but you have full-year pricing going in, do you expect gross margins to be higher and you could just confirm that that would be helpful. And then Rodney on pricing, can you talk about Red Bulls pricing posture. So from a U.S. perspective, they clearly haven't followed yet. Is that concerning? Is there a point at which you consider rolling back pricing or promoting it back through trade and then maybe internationally, what are you seeing from them. Do you think will be further opportunity to price beyond what you've outlined on this call? Thank you for that.
Rodney Sacks: Kevin, I'll just take the last question first. Red Bull obviously has made a strategic decision once we had announced our increase to be aggressive in some of the promotions, more so that in previous years and to try and pick up some volume in share. Would that be losing for some time. We've seen that, it doesn't affect us. We've I think been successful at what we strategically intended to achieve and we're not intending to roll back any pricing at this time. We're satisfied with where we've got with pricing and we think the pricing is fine. And so we don't believe that Red Bull will continue because it's going to hurt their margins and they won't continue indefinitely. But that's -- we can't speculate as to what's in their heads but whether they do so or not. We don't believe that would be a factor for us or any materiality quite frankly and so we're moving forward with our plans.
Hilton Schlosberg: So just to add a little bit to that, the price increase that was planned was really carefully planned in relation to Red Bulls pricing where there were significant gaps between our price on shelf and where Red Bull was at that time. And what we were able to do with our price increase was move us closer to the Red Bull pricing. So if you look at the -- at the pricing in the 4% that we implemented, the objective was to get pretty close to where Red Bull had their products priced in the market. And obviously we're only talking about the U.S. And then on your other point on gross margin, you know Kevin, I didn't have to give you guidance because we don't give guidance, but you've got all the facts, you know that aluminum is coming down. We've said that freight costs are continuing to increase. You know our geographical sales mix because we've spoken about that there and we've also spoken about our new products and that the new products are largely going to be focused on better margin products. So you can come to your own conclusion. I think you know where I'm heading, and how can I give any guidance or any discussion on margin, but I think that's enough for you to able to work it out.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Sacks for any closing remarks.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I would like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the past. We continue to believe in this company, and our growth strategy remains committed to continuing to innovate, develop, and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. And in particular, expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottler system internationally. We are also particularly excited about new opportunities that we have going forward with the portfolio of Energy Drink products throughout the world comprised of our Monster Energy Brand together with our Strategic Brands as well as Hydro, Mutant, and in particular Predator and Reign. Thank you very much for your attention and your attendance.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2018 Q3  (2018-11-07 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.
Analysts: Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Corporation's Third Quarter 2018 Financial Results. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may begin.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I am Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our last Vice Chairman and President, is with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I'd like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2018, and our Form 10-Q filed on August 9, 2018, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements for discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures which may be mentioned during the course of this call is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated November 7, 2018. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. There are encouraging signs in the beverage category globally, and we continue to see positive momentum in the energy category. Net sales for the 2018 third quarter were negatively impacted by $11.6 million, due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606. Under ASC 606, commissions paid to The Coca-Cola Company based on our sales to certain of the company's customers, which The Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method or consolidates, are now included as a reduction to net sales. Whereas, prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers, which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method, were included in operating expenses. Gross and net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018, were impacted by advance purchases made by our customers due to a pre-announced price increase effective November 1, 2018, on certain of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. The company estimates that impact to gross and net sales was approximately $18 million and $16 million, respectively. In the third quarter of 2018, net sales were $1.02 billion, up 11.7%, from $909.5 million in the third quarter of 2017. Without the adoption ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 13%. Net sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $5.3 million of foreign currency movements. The company recorded third quarter gross sales of $1.18 billion, up 13.7%, from $1.04 billion in the third quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $5.6 million of foreign currency movements. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, for the 2018 third quarter was 59.8%, compared with 62.6% in the 2017 third quarter. The gross profit percentage, as adjusted for ASC 606, would have been 60.3% for the quarter. The decrease in gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was primarily attributable to increases in certain import costs such as aluminum cans, freight in and other input costs; the $11.6 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606; an increase in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales; domestic product sales mix; and geographical gross profit mix. Distribution costs, as a percentage of net sales, were 4.1% for the 2018 third quarter as compared to 3.2% in the 2017 third quarter, an increase of $12.8 million, largely due to higher carrier contract rates in the U.S. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 11.2% compared to 12.7% in the same quarter a year ago. General and administrative costs, as a percentage of net sales, were 11.1% as compared to 11.8% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributor termination expenses of $14.1 million for the 2018 third quarter, as compared with the $15.9 million in the comparable 2017 third quarter. Excluding distributor termination expenses in both quarters, the comparable general and the administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 9.7% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to 10.1% in the same quarter last year. In the quarter, payroll expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 6.2% compared to 6.3% in the same period last year. Payroll costs increased $5.9 million primarily due to head count growth both domestically and internationally. Legal expenses relating to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $1.4 million in the 2018 third quarter, as compared to $2.9 million in the 2017 third quarter. Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China of $2.9 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate decreased from 31.9% in the 2017 third quarter to 21.8% in the 2018 third quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017, and to a reduction in certain foreign income that is subject to U.S. taxation. The decrease was partially offset by the elimination of the domestic production deduction. We anticipate that the effective tax rate will be higher in the fourth quarter. Net income was $267.7 million in the 2018 third quarter, compared to net income of $218.7 million in the 2017 third quarter, an increase of 22.4%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 578.4 million for the third quarter of 2017 to 560 million for the third quarter of 2018 as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call. Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 third quarter increased 26.4% to $0.48 from $0.38 in the third quarter of 2017. Excluding distributor termination expenses in the 2018 third quarter and in the comparable quarter last year, earnings per share would have increased 25.6% to $0.50 per share. We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. We are also making good progress in the U.S. in non-traditional channels, including foodservice accounts, e-commerce and home improvement stores. In the third quarter of 2018, we completed the transition of Arkansas to Coca-Cola bottlers. This concludes the Anheuser-Busch distributor transition in the United States. In EMEA, we launched in Ukraine. Further launches are planned in the fourth quarter of 2018 and in the first quarter of 2019 in Azerbaijan and in Armenia. Last week, we launched Predator in South Africa as our strategically preferred energy brand. And plan to launch Predator later in 2018 and in 2019 in select Eastern European and African markets. During the third quarter of 2018, we launched Monster in Ecuador. Paraguay and Bolivia are now on track to launch in the first quarter of 2019. In China, we continue to focus our efforts towards establishing Monster around the country, with an emphasis on distribution in the top 40 cities and to key accounts, targeting younger and more affluent consumer demographics. Our core range will expand its offering and appeal with the launch of Ultra White in the fourth quarter. We continued the rollout of Monster to Coca-Cola India. We have now expanded the launch to 40 of the largest cities across the country. Monster is now selling in approximately 75% of the country, with national rollout expected by year-end. Mutant energy, one of our affordable energy brands that we have positioned differently from the Mutant Super Soda previously sold in the U.S., was launched in Myanmar and Vietnam in the third quarter. Mutant energy is now available in Cambodia, Myanmar, Pakistan and Vietnam. I wanted to take a moment to address one aspect of our agreement with Coca-Cola. Among other provisions, these agreements between the company, Coca-Cola and certain affiliates restrict Coca-Cola from competing in the energy drink category with certain exceptions. As some of you may have read, Coca-Cola has developed two energy products it believes it may market under an exception relating to the Coca-Cola brand. We believe that the exception does not apply. While mutual agreement to obtain clarification, the issue was submitted to arbitration last week on October 31, 2018. Coca-Cola has indicated that it has suspended the proposed launch of such energy products until April 2019. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through September 29, 2018, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 6.6% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 10% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 4.8% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 1.4%. Sales of Red Bull increased 4.8%, sales of Rockstar decreased by 7.9%, sales of 5-Hour decreased 3.9%, and sales of Amp decreased 24.6%. According to Nielsen, for the five weeks ended September 29, 2018, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased 5.1% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 8.8% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 2.7% and Full Throttle was up 0.4%. Sales of Red Bull were up 2%, Rockstar was down 12%, 5-Hour was down 6.6%, and Amp was down 29.2%. According to Nielsen, for the five weeks ended September 29, 2018, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars increased by 1.3 points over the same period last year to 38.1%. NOS's share declined 0.1 of a share point to 4%, and Full Throttle's share remained the same at 0.9%. Red Bull's share decreased 1.0 points to 33.7%, Rockstar's share was down 1.3 points to 6.6%, 5-Hour's share was lower by 0.9 of a point at 7%, and Amp's share decreased 0.3 of a point to 0.7%. According to Nielsen, for the five weeks ended September 29, 2018, sales of coffee plus energy drinks, which now include Caffé Monster and Espresso Monster in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 18.8% over the same period last year. Sales of our Java Monster alone was 17.1% higher than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 2.5% lower. Our share of the coffee plus energy category, which includes Java Monster, Caffé Monster, Espresso Monster, Starbucks Doubleshot and Rockstar Roasted for the five weeks ended September 29, 2018, was 56.3%, up 9.6 points. Java Monster's share alone for the five weeks ended September 29, 2018, was 46.1%, down 0.7 of a point, while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy share was 43.6%, down 9.5 points. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended September 15, 2018, the energy drink category increased 6% in dollars. Monster sales increased 12% versus a year ago. Monster's market share increased 1.5 share points to 33.9%. NOS's sales decreased 9%, and its market share decreased 0.4 of a share point to 3%. Full Throttle's sales increased 10% and its market share remained at 1.4%. Red Bull's sales increased 7% and its market share increased 0.5 of a point to 37.8%. Rockstar's sales decreased 4% and its market share decreased 1.4 points to 14.9%. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category drew 30.6% during the month of September 2018. Monster sales increased 34.5%. Our market share in value increased 0.9 of a point to 29.9% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn were flat. Burn's market share decreased 0.5 of a point to 1.6%. Red Bull's sales increased 2.9% and its market share decreased by 2.4 points to 9%. Vive 100 sales increased 27.6% and its market share decreased for 0.9 of a point to 37.2%, while Boost's market share decreased 1.2 points to 7.8%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO Convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO Convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. I'd like to point out that Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending October 2018, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 11.4% to 12.4% in Belgium; from 22.8% to 23.3% in France; from 18.4% to 20.9% in Great Britain; from 6.4% to 7.1% in the Netherlands; from 15.3% to 18% in Norway; from 27.5% to 29.3% in Spain; and from 10.3% to 13.6% in Sweden. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending September 2018, Monster's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period last year, grew from 12.4% to 14.4% in the Czech Republic; from 15.4% to 16.4% in Germany; from 33.6% to 34.5% in Greece; from 13.2% to 17% in Italy; and from 7.3% to 10.7% in Poland. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending August, Monster's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period last year, grew from 13.4% to 14.7% in Ireland. For the 13-week period ended September 2018, Monster's retail market share in value decreased, however, from 15.6% to 15.3% in South Africa, although the value of sales increased in the same comparative period. According to Nielsen, for the month of September 2018 in Chile, Monster's retail market share and value increased from 30.8% to 34.5% compared to the same period last year. According to Nielsen, in Brazil, Monster's retail market share for the month of September increased from 13.7% to 16.9% as compared to the same period last year. We launched Argentina in mid-February 2018. According to Nielsen, Argentina reached a 13.8% market share in value as of September 2018. According to IRI in Australia, Monster's market share in value increased from 7.4% to 8.9% in September 2018, as compared to the same period last year. Mother's market share in value increased from 12.9% to 13.5% in September 2018, as compared to the same period last year. According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the last four weeks ending September 30, 2018, increased from 6.4% to 6.8%, as compared to the same period last year. Lift Plus market share in value decreased from 9.7% to 8.8%; and Mother's market share in value decreased from 6.3% to 5.7%. According to Nielsen in South Korea, Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined grew from 24.9% to 38.4% in the third quarter of 2018, versus the same period last year. According to INTAGE, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 44.9% to 48.9% in the third quarter of 2018, versus the same period last year. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those months. Net sales of the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the third quarter of 2018 increased 13% from $827.7 million to $935.1 million in the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the 2018 third quarter were negatively impacted by $5.3 million due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment would have been 13.6%. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the third quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by approximately $3.9 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $74.4 million for the third quarter, as compared to $76.6 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment for the third quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by $6.3 million due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in sales for the Strategic Brands segment would have been 5.5%. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment in the third quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by approximately $1.4 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $6.6 million in the third quarter, as compared to $5.2 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $283 million in the 2018 third quarter, compared to $260.1 million in the corresponding quarter in 2017. Foreign exchange had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $5.3 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and trans-shipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA, we had a challenging quarter with supply chain and production issues, which not only affected our sales, but also resulted in a number of out-of-stocks and cancellations of orders from the retail trade in certain countries in EMEA. As mentioned earlier, our Nielsen growth rates and market share continues to be strong in the territory. We are continuing to address these supply chain and production issues. In EMEA, net sales in the third quarter increased marginally in dollars and increased 0.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 4.8% in dollars and 5.3% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region, as a percentage of net sales, for the quarter was 41.3%, compared to 50.9% in the same quarter last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, would have been 44% for the third quarter. Gross profit in the region was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales, relative to sales of concentrates for our Strategic Brands in the region. We estimate that net sales in the quarter in dollars, without the adoption of ASC 606, were adversely affected by approximately 11% due to supply chain and production issues. We are pleased with the rollout of additional SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In the third quarter of 2018, we introduced Ultra Citron in Italy and Poland, Ultra White in Macedonia, and Ultra Violet in Sweden. Various SKUs in the Ultra line are now sold in 38 EMEA markets. We are also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gain market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain and Sweden. In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the third quarter increased 27.2% in dollars and 28.3% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 29.6% in dollars and 30.7% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region, as a percentage of net sales, was 44.1% versus 46.5% over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would've been 45.1%. The decrease in the gross profit percentage was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales, relative to concentrate sales of our Strategic Brands. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 17.4% in dollars and 17.1% in local currency. In South Korea, net sales increased 155.7% in dollars and 151.2% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 21.4% in dollars and 27.5% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the third quarter increased 20.5% in dollars and 32.5% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would've been 23.4% in dollars and 35.4% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region, as a percentage of net sales was 44%, versus 47.6% over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would've been 45.3%. Net sales in Brazil in the quarter increased by 31.6% in dollars and 57.2% in local currency. Net sales in Brazil were impacted by ASC 606 and higher taxes on sales. Net sales in Chile decreased 16.2% in dollars and 16.4% in local currency in the quarter, largely due to supply issues. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $713.7 million, compared $528.6 million at December 31, 2017. Short-term investments were $457.9 million, compared to $672.9 million at December 31, 2017. Long-term investments were $1.6 million, compared to $2.4 million at December 31, 2017. Net accounts receivable increased to $620.2 million at September 30, 2018, from $449.5 million at December 31, 2017. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 47.6 days at September 30, 2018. Inventories increased to $262.1 million from $255.7 million at December 31, 2017. Average days of inventory were 57.7 days at September 30, 2018, compared 75 days at December 31, 2017. In the third quarter of 2018, we launched Pacific Punch, a line extension of our Juice Monster family in the U.S. Initial results have been positive. In Canada in the third quarter of 2018, we launch Mango Loco nationally. In Mexico in the third quarter of 2018, we launched our Lewis Hamilton Monster Energy Drink and also re-launched Monster Energy Khaos. In the third quarter of 2018, we launched our Lewis Hamilton Monster Energy Drinks in Romania and Finland and launched Monster Pipeline Punch in Sweden. We also launched Monster Mixed Punch (00:27:51) in Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovenia; Monster Hydro in 550 ml PET bottles in Australia; and Monster Mango Loco in Germany.
Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Austria.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Sorry, PET bottles in Austria and Monster Mango Loco in Germany. Sorry, thank you. In Australia, in the third quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Mango Loco and are in the process of launching Monster Pipeline Punch with a major convenience and gas retailer in Australia with a national launch planned for the first quarter of 2019. In October 2018, we launched both Monster Mango Loco and Monster Pipeline Punch in New Zealand. During the quarter, and in line with our agreement with The Coca-Cola Company, we transitioned the Lift Plus strategic brand in New Zealand to LIVE+ with three SKUs and new graphics. In the third quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Ultra Citron in South Korea and Monster Ultra in Taiwan and Hong Kong. We've implemented an approximately 4% price increase to our U.S. customers, effective November 1 for Monster Energy. We will implement a price increase for NOS and Full Throttle on January 1, 2019. We're planning a price increase to our Canadian customers, effective February 1, 2019, for Monster Energy, NOS and Full Throttle. We estimate that October 2018 gross sales to be approximately 18% higher than in October 2017. Gross sales for the month ended October 2018 were impacted by advance purchases by our customers due to the price increase, effective November 1, 2018, on certain Monster Energy drinks. We estimate that October 2018 gross sales would've been approximately 12% higher than in October 2017 without these advance purchases. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, October 2018 gross sales would've been approximately 14% higher than the comparable October 2017 gross sales. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production – in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules which affects the days on which we invoice such bottlers, as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month or even two months, should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any other future period. No shares of common stock were repurchased by the company during the 2018 third quarter. However, we do have outstanding board authorizations of approximately $696.7 million for the repurchase of our common stock. In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. The company continues to gain market share in the U.S. and many countries. Retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category, in line with earlier periods. The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We're excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. We are continuing to launch Monster Energy Drinks with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain markets. I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Due to time limitations, we ask that you keep your questions to one only. Our first question comes from Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good evening, everyone.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi, Amit.
Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi, Amit.
Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Rodney, can you provide a little bit more context into the energy drink brands being developed by Coca-Cola? How far along are they or any other information on it, please?
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: I think that we have some information, but we don't have full information. And I think that now that an arbitration has been filed between us to try and determine our respective rights, we just believe that it isn't appropriate for us to provide additional comments at this time. Our commercial business activities and relationship is continuing as in the past, and we are looking to just get a third-party determination for the correct interpretation of our respective rights.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. Hi, everyone.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi, Judy.
Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi, Judy.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So, Rodney, just as a follow-up, just a quick follow-up on the last question. I mean, maybe if you could take a little bit of a step back and just kind of give your perspective on the relationship that's been evolving with The Coca-Cola Company. Obviously, the Mutant situation didn't also go as well as I think that you were hoping for. So kind of how do you see this changing your relationship with the KO, as well as the bottlers? So maybe just be helpful to just get your broader perspective. And then, more specifically, my other question is just really on the EMEA supply chain issues. I'm just wondering if this is limited to certain countries or this is really a broader regional issue. And whether this is being addressed as we speak, so we get more of a bump up in sales in the fourth quarter? It seems like we've been having some of these supply chain issues in international markets time-to-time. So how do we think about really more fully addressing the issue broadly? Thank you.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: That's a lot for one question, Judy.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: A follow-up, one was a follow-up.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Okay. On the relationship with Coke, I think our relationship is good and continues to be good. There is Coke, obviously, looking at their own portfolio and looking for where they believe they see opportunities and where their own BUs would look to expand their own portfolio. As we indicated in the call, there is an exception for certain products that are in the Coca-Cola brand and that is of itself an area that we are looking at. We have a difference of opinion on it. We don't know and at this point we don't think it's appropriate for us to speculate on if that comes to fruition, what effect that might or might not have on our brand. I mean, we continue to be partners with Coca-Cola and with the bottlers. We continue to have our full range sold by them. And we just don't think that at this point we'd be in a position or should be in a position to speculate on what effect that might happen. There will just be another product being sold by Coca-Cola bottlers, but the impact and effect on us would be something I think wouldn't be appropriate for us to deal with that. We don't believe it will have a majority impact on our relationship. We just believe we'll have to manage it in an appropriate way if and when it occurs. On the EMEA supply chain side, I think...
Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Sorry, Rodney. Maybe I could give a different perspective to Judy or a similar perspective.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Sure.
Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: The relationship with The Coca-Cola Company, I believe, is good. And I'm not a lawyer, so I'm giving the response to you from a business perspective. There is an issue in an agreement, which we've agreed to go to arbitration civilly and determine what course of action is appropriate. So nothing has changed in the relationship. And the manner in which this situation will be dealt with will be conducted from both parties on a civil basis according to the agreement. So I honestly don't see any changes in the relationship with The Coca-Cola Company.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Sure. All right. On the EMEA supply chain side, it affected us through a number of plants in different areas, not obviously right through all of the – there are probably 70 or 80 countries that comprise EMEA, but there were a number of countries and a number of plants that did have supply issues for a whole host of reasons. We've taken steps to address this. We had a period of time when our previous Senior VP of Operations retired and we were looking for a successor. We have appointed a successor who is – he has got his feet on this desk and he's in the job, he's been out in Europe. We have also appointed a new VP of Operations in Europe to give us more hands on deck there. And so, we are looking at getting our hands around it. We are in the process of doing it at this point in time. Perhaps if you'd like to add some color to that?
Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: No, I think that we've had issues. Remember, it was a very hot summer in Europe and a lot of the plants were working to capacity and beyond capacity. We've had certain issues, which are being addressed and will be addressed going forward. And the one thing is clear is that our business is growing, which is a good thing. And we have to ensure that we have sufficient capacity and sufficient plants to be able to accommodate our needs.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen. Your line is open.
Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Good evening.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi.
Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: So I was hoping to talk about your U.S. business and specifically the trends for your core Green Monster, where, at least in the Nielsen scanner data that we have, it does appear that there has been a modest softening in terms of the market share declines. So can you offer any color on whether there has been a change in your promotional strategy heading into the price increase or is this more interaction with new product offerings that are hitting the market? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: If I'm looking at the general market, Monster is continuing to increase its share. The category is growing and Monster is growing in excess of the market. If I look at regular Monster as such, I'm just looking, for example, at the main channel, which is convenience, there is still some growth in Monster in the original core line in its 16-ounce. And then, obviously, we have additional SKUs with the original Green Monster. So the core brand is continuing to grow. There has been the entry into the market of additional products, primarily probably in what we would maybe call or describe as a performance energy category or a workout fitness energy category or not even really maybe in that category. And there is some sales on that. There are a number of reasons that those products are all sort of starting to gain some traction. But if I look at the sales levels, they are still behind the increase in sales. So I think, overall, we are getting additional products in the category, but the category itself is continuing to grow.
Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: So we're still seeing growth, Vivien, in Monster Green. It's continuing to grow. And remember, we've added a number of other SKUs into the portfolio on both juice products and the Ultra range, which is the no-sugar product. So while we are seeing growth in Monster Green, there has been as well the proliferation of other SKUs within our portfolio.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Yes. In that side, obviously on the coffee side, we are continuing to see growth in Java. We've just launched a line extension in Java. We have the Caffé Monster line and Espresso Monster again, that has continued to grow. On the Ultra line, which is growing, we do have plans to launch an additional Ultra in the spring, which will be launched, which is Ultra Paradise. So we are all continuing to see growth in the category. And we see additional entrants probably to some extent. We are not sure of the exact measurement at this point in time, but do see some increase in incremental sales coming into the category from these new entrants.
Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: And Monster Green does remain a very important barometer for us.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is open.
Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Hey. Good afternoon, guys.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi, Mark.
Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So I'm going to try the Coke thing again. You can answer or not, I guess. My understanding of the exceptions relate to the specific products or specific ingredients which is in there. So are we talking about a product in similarity to, say, a Kickstart from the Pepsi system, where it's effectively sort of a competitor, but not really? Are they adding some sort of caffeine component to some other beverage, which is a non-carbonated soft drink? I mean, any sort of color you can give on that, that would be helpful.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Mark, there isn't a limitation on them just adding caffeine. They could have a higher caffeine product, there's no limitation on that. There is, if you look at the agreement, which is filed, there are certain ingredients that are, if used in combination, obviously then create a definition. And there is a definition of what an energy drink is. The exception goes back to the Coca-Cola brand, not Sprite, not Kickstart, not any other brand, it's the Coca-Cola brand. And there are certain exceptions about what – because the Coke brand has certain – otherwise there would be certain limitations. And there is an exception for that brand. But I think that it's a long explanation. There are different analyses of what that means and what that entitles Coke to do under that brand. Again, if it was just a question of adding vitamins, well, then Coke would obviously add vitamins. There isn't an issue with that. But where the brand transcends into a product that we see positioned as an energy drink, that's where we have a difference of view on the exception and under the Coke brand. That is really where we are. I think there is not much more we could really add or more color we could give at this point in time. There is a section in the agreement that you guys could look up if you really had that interest. But we are dealing with it with Coke. And we think we will come to a resolution reasonably quickly as to what that exception means and how it should be implemented.
Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: And just to add on that, Mark, what I said earlier, the discussions are very civil and very business-like, very civil. And it's a question of difference of opinion, which will be resolved in per the agreement.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is open.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Afternoon, Bill.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Just a little bit further on the gross margin, but for kind of the quarter and then going forward with pricing. Trying to understand, as we look, will this more than offset – I mean, can you hold gross margins relatively flat going forward? And when I say that, have we seen the full impact of costs in the third quarter? Or do you still have another kind of layer or step-up of cost input inflation that kicks in fourth quarter and 2019?
Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Well, what's interesting looking at aluminum and the tariffs and the imposition of tariffs were announced way after we had our discussion on this call about gross margins. So we've had this increase in tariff, which has resulted in increase of aluminum, which is slowly coming off, right? It's a very slow process. So we've also had extreme increases in freight-in in costs that we account for cost of sales, where product is moved to our co-packers or moved to our warehouses. That's all included in cost of sales. So we have had significant cost increases in that regard as well. So we have these cost increases. I think that the quarter that we've just experienced, I'm not seeing further increases in aluminum and I'm not seeing further increases in freight either, but anything is possible. Having said that, we will have price increase from November 1. And the other thing for sure is we will continue to have this ASC 606 adjustment, which we didn't have when we first spoke about the gross margin issue earlier this year. So it's kind of a mixed bag, with increases and cost increases, which is exactly why we were forced into having a price increase. So – but I hope that answers your question.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah. I think I understand, but I guess it's more of, do you see any need for further price increases from here?
Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Well, we've announced a price increase in NOS and Full Throttle, which we spoke about on the call. We are proposing a price increase in Canada, which we discussed on the call. And where we are now with regard to price increases, I'm not sure we will – having implementing a price increase in November 1, I'm not sure there is runway to do it again within a short period of time unless costs dramatically and significantly increase from where they are today.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Yeah. At this point, we haven't sort of envisaged price increases in other places around the world, but I think that is something we will be evaluating and looking at the markets, the elasticity where we – if we can justify pricing. We'll evaluate that going early in the new year.
Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: See, in the United States, we really are now the market leader. In the various countries around the world, we really price ourselves after Red Bull in most cases. And we don't want the difference between our pricing and Red Bull's pricing to be significantly out of whack.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Yes. Thanks. Next question?
Operator: Thank you. Thank you. That ends our Q&A session for today's call. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Sacks for any further remarks.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Thank you. On behalf of the company, we'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest. We continue to believe in the company and our strategy, and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad and in particular to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally. We also particularly excited by the new opportunities we have going forward with a portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world, comprised of our Monster Energy brand together with our Strategic Brands, as well as Hydro, Mutant and, in particular, Predator. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program, you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Corporation Second Quarter 2018 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, we will host a question-and-answer session and our instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded. It is now my pleasure to hand the conference over to Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Sir, you may begin.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today. Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance, is on a well-deserved vacation. Before we begin, I'd like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations, and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2018, and our Form 10-Q filed on May 10, 2018, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements for discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated August 8, 2018. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. Growth in the beverage industry globally continues to be challenging. However, we are seeing positive momentum in the energy category. Net sales for the 2018 second quarter were negatively impacted by $12.2 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606, under ASC 606, commissions paid to The Coca-Cola Company based on our sales to certain of the company's customers, which The Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method or consolidates, are now included as a reduction to net sales. Whereas prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers, which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method were included in operating expenses. In the second quarter, net sales were $1.02 billion, up 12% from $907.1 million in the second quarter of 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been $13.3%. Net sales in the second quarter were positively impacted by approximately $16.8 million of foreign currency movements. The company recorded second quarter gross sales of $1.19 billion, up 14.7% from $1.04 billion in the second quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the second quarter were positively impacted by approximately $21.4 million of foreign currency movements. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2018 second quarter was 61.1% compared to 64.3% in the 2017 second quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales, the $12.2 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606, increases in certain input costs such as aluminum cans and other costs, domestic product sales mix and geographical sales mix. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.7% for the 2018 second quarter as compared to 3% in the 2017 second quarter, an increase of $10.7 million largely due to higher carrier cost contract rates in the U.S. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.4% compared to 12.6% in the same quarter a year ago. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 10.7% as compared to 10.1% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributed termination expenses of $5.5 million for the 2018 second quarter as compared with $0.2 million in the comparable 2017 second quarter. In the quarter, payroll expenses were up $9 million compared to the same period last year, primarily due to head count growth both domestically and internationally. Legal expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $0.7 million in the 2018 second quarter as compared to $2.4 million in the 2017 second quarter. Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China and India. The losses in India were due to establishment costs incurred in advance of the launch and in connection with the current rollout as well as inventory reserves. Our effective tax rate decreased from 35.9% in the 2017 second quarter to 24.6% in the 2018 second quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017. The decrease was partially offset by the elimination of the domestic production deduction. Net income was $270.1 million in the 2018 second quarter compared to net income of $222.6 million in the 2017 second quarter, an increase of 21.3%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 578 million for the second quarter of 2017 to 566.4 million for the second quarter of 2018 as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call. Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 second quarter increased 23.8% to $0.48 from $0.39 in the second quarter of 2017. We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. We also are making good progress in the U.S. in non-traditional channels including foodservice accounts and e-commerce. We reached agreements to transition Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers in Arkansas. In the second quarter of 2018, we transitioned parts of Arkansas and are planning on transitioning the remainder of Arkansas in the third quarter of 2018. In EMEA, we launched in Belarus and Tanzania. Further launches are planned in the third and fourth quarters of 2018 in Armenia, Azerbaijan and Ukraine. We plan to launch Predator later in 2018 and in 2019 as an affordable energy brand in select eastern European and African markets. During the second quarter of 2018, we launched Monster in Uruguay and relaunched Monster in Peru. In July, we launched Monster in Ecuador. Bolivia is on track to launch later this year. In China, we continue to focus our efforts towards establishing Monster around the country with an emphasis on distribution in the top 40 cities and to key accounts, targeting the younger and more affluent consumer demographic. We commenced shipments of Monster to Coca-Cola India where we launched Monster in April in a lead market. We have now expanded the launch to a number of larger cities principally in the south and west regions of India. We plan to complete a national rollout in India by year-end. Mutant, one of our affordable energy brands that is positioned differently than in the U.S., was recently launched in Pakistan and Cambodia with launches in Myanmar and Vietnam during the third quarter of 2018. According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through June 30, 2018, for all our outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including Energy Shots increased by 9% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 16.7% in the 13-week period while sales of NOS increased 8% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 1.6%. Sales of Red Bull increased 6.5%. Sales of Rockstar decreased by 3.9%. Sales of 5-Hour decreased 3.8%, and sales of Amp decreased 18.4%. According to Nielsen, for the five weeks ended June 30, 2018, sales in the convenience and gas channel including Energy Shots in dollars increased 10.5% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 17.5% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 7% and Full Throttle was down 1.7%. Sales of Red Bull were up 9%, Rockstar was down 5.5%, 5-Hour was down 2.8%, and Amp was down 19.6%. According to Nielsen for the five weeks ended June 30, 2018, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel including Energy Shots in dollars increased by 2.3 points over the same period last year to 38.1%. NOS's share declined 0.1 share point to 4% and Full Throttle's share declined 0.1 share point to 0.9%. Red Bull's share decreased 0.5 point to 35.3%. Rockstar's share was down 1.1 points to 6.7%, 5-Hour's share was lowered by 0.9 points at 6.4%, and Amp's share decreased 0.3 point to 0.8%. According to Nielsen for the five weeks ended June 30, 2018, sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks, which now includes Caffé Monster and Espresso Monster in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 22.3% over the same period last year. Sales of our Java Monster alone were 25.9% higher than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 3.9% lower. Our share of the Coffee Plus Energy (sic) [Energy Plus Coffee] (11:21) category including Java Monster, Caffé Monster, Espresso Monster, Starbucks Doubleshot and Rockstar Roasted for the five weeks ended June 30, 2018, was 56%, up 12 points. Java Monster's share alone for the five weeks ended June 30, 2018, was 45.3%, up 1.3 points, while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy's share was 43.8%, down 11.9 points. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended June 23, 2018, the energy drink category increased 9% in dollars. Monster sales increased 13% versus a year ago. Monster's market share increased one share point to 32.3%. NOS's sales decreased 15%, and its market share decreased 0.8 share points to 2.7%. Full Throttle sales increased 13% and its market share increased by 0.1 points to 1.5%. Red Bull sales increased 10% and its market share increased 0.2 points to 37.5%. Rockstar sales increased 12% and its market share increased 0.4 points to 17.2%. According to Nielsen for all our outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 20.6% during the month of June 2018. Monster sales increased 28.3%. Our market share in value increased 1.7 points to 29.2% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 31.1%. Burn's market share decreased 1.2 points to 1.5%. Red Bull sales decreased 2% and its market share decreased by 2.2 points to 9.5%. Vive 100 sales increased 14.6% and its market share decreased 2 points to 38%, while Boost's market share decreased 0.5 point to 7.8%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO Convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO Convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. I'd like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ending July 2018, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 11.5% to 12.2% in Belgium, from 15.2% to 16.8% in Germany, from 17.2% to 19.6% in Great Britain, from 5.7% to 7.2% in the Netherlands and from 27.1% to 29.1% in Spain.

For the 13-week period ended June 2018, Monster's retail market share in value decreased, however, from 15.5% to 14.7% in South Africa, although the value of sales increased over the same comparative period.

According to IRI, Monster's market share in Australia was 8% for the latest four weeks ended July 22, 2018 as compared to 6.8% in the same period last year. And in New Zealand, Monster's market share was 6.4% for the latest four weeks ended July 8, 2018 as compared to 5.5% in the same period last year. According to Nielsen, in South Korea, Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined grew from 28.1% to 34.6% in the second quarter of 2018 versus the same period last year. According to INTAGE, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 43.4% to 48.7% in the second quarter of 2018 versus the same period last year. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during these months. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the second quarter of 2018 increased 14% from $815.3 million to $929.4 million from the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Drinks Energy (sic) [Monster Energy Drinks] (17:12) segment in the 2018 second quarter were negatively impacted by $5.1 million due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment would have been 14.6%. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the second quarter of 2018 were positively impacted by approximately $15.5 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $79.8 million for the second quarter as compared to $85.6 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment for the second quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by $7.1 million due to the adoption of ASC 606.

Foreign exchange had the effect of increasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $16.8 million. Included in reported geographic sales, are our sales to the company's military customers which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the second quarter increased 21.4% in dollars and 11.2% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 27.5% in dollars and 17.3% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 43.8% compared to 49% in the same quarter [Technical Difficulties] (19:22). Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 46.5% for the second quarter. Gross profit in the region was impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales. We are pleased with the rollout of additional SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In the second quarter of 2018, we introduced Ultra Citron in Austria, Ultra Red in Switzerland, Romania, Slovenia, Bosnia and Croatia, Ultra Sunrise in Croatia and Slovenia, and Ultra Violet in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Various SKUs in the Ultra line are now sold in 38 EMEA markets.

In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 13.9% in dollars and 10.1% in local currency compared to the same quarter last year. In South Korea, net sales increased 30.5% in dollars and 23.8% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year.

Net sales in Brazil in the quarter increased by 1.6% in local currency, impacted by ASC 606 and higher taxes on sales and decreased 6.3% in dollars as a result of foreign currency movements. Net sales in Chile increased 39.3% in dollars and 28.5% in local currency. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $659.7 million compared to $528.6 million at December 31, 2017. Short-term investments were $211.1 million compared to $672.9 million at December 31, 2017. At the end of the quarter, we held no long-term investments. Accounts receivable increased to $592.6 million at June 30, 2018, from $449.5 million at December 31, 2017. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 45.2 days compared to 43.8 days at December 31, 2017. Inventories increased to $275.6 million from $255.7 million at December 31, 2017. Average days of inventory were 62.7 days at June 30, 2018 compared to 75 days at December 31, 2017. In the second quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Mule, a ginger-flavored energy drink exclusively with a large regional convenience store customer. Initial results have been positive. In Canada in the second quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Green and Zero Ultra in a slim 310ml can and a Collector's Edition Lewis Hamilton Monster Energy drink in a 473ml can. We also launched Monster Mango Loco with 7-Eleven in Canada this June and we will roll out nationally in Canada during the third quarter of 2018. Following the launch of Monster Hydro in the first quarter in Sweden and Germany, we launched Monster Hydro in 550ml PET bottles in France and BPM Zero in Ireland in June 2018. In the first half of 2018, we launched Monster Mango Loco in Great Britain and Sweden along with Monster Pipeline Punch in Great Britain, Belgium, France and Germany, and Relentless Apple Kiwi in Great Britain. We also recently launched Mutant as an affordable energy drink in Pakistan and Cambodia. In the second quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Ultra Citra in South Korea. We are planning for approximately a 4% increase in our pricing to our customers effective November 1, 2018 for Monster and January 1, 2019 for NOS and Full Throttle. We estimate July 2018 gross sales to be approximately 15.9% higher than in July 2017. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate July 2018 gross sales to be approximately 15.7% higher than in July 2017. Please note that the impact of ASC 606 has not been included in determining these figures. July had one extra selling day in 2018. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances, where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers, as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month or even two months, should not necessarily be imputed to or be regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. During the 2018 second quarter, the company purchased approximately 10.6 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $52.42 per share, for a total of $553.2 million, excluding broker commissions. As of August 7, 2018, approximately $196.7 million remains available for repurchase under our previously authorized repurchase program. On August 7, 2018, the company's board of directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points; One, the company's continued to achieve record market shares in the U.S. and many countries. Two, retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in line with earlier periods. Three, the new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. Four, we are excited by the prospects for our brands and our new product launches. Five, we are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India. Six, we are continuing to launch Monster Energy drinks with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain markets. And I would now like to open the floor to questions about the quarter.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time if you would like to ask a question...
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Sorry, just – sorry. Could I just make – just one clarification. The price increase I referred to is related to the U.S. Sorry. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen...
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: All right, thank you.
Operator: ...my pleasure. And our first question will come from the line of Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Good afternoon.
Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Rodney, just talk about international sales growth a little bit. We saw some deceleration across all three regions. Anything to note there or is it just part of normal volatility in these markets?
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: We think it's part of the normal operations. There have been some sort of – some noise – some countries were higher than others. We are looking at it, but we think that it's, again also distorted in some cases by monthly numbers. We are seeing quite big differences in the monthly numbers as we see them come through from overseas markets. So I think we'll just wait and see what the trend is going to be when we go through the third quarter.
Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Yeah, I think that's fair. If you look at the consolidated foreign numbers, including Canada, net sales grew at 18.69%. So we also have to adjust for ASC 606. So there are some variabilities in that, and overall we haven't seen a slowing in sales. There's just been some issues in certain countries, which we believe will correct themselves in the next few months.
Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Any abnormal inventory builds in any market that's worth pointing out to?
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: No. Actually, there was inventory issues in the quarter, mainly in Europe, where unfortunately, there was insufficient production capacity to satisfy demand. They're having a very hot summer in Europe, as you know, and we've had some production challenges in Europe. So to the contrary, it's lower inventories rather than higher inventories.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, hey, thanks, and good afternoon, guys.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi, Mark.
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So just a quick follow up on the last one and then another question. In Asia, it sounded like that was a little bit weaker. Maybe any sort of update on what's going on in China? Was there any sort of impact there from lapping the sell-in from a year ago? And then shifting to the U.S., just curious, anything you're seeing domestically? It looked like the trends, if I looked at it correctly, were a little bit below what the scanner data said consumption looked like, you said that online and on-track was doing well. So I don't know, anything that you see there that may have explained the delta?
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Well, I think you'll always see a discrepancy between Nielsen and ourselves. And we've discussed this many times on various calls that we sell to our distributors. We also have some direct customers, but in the main, our sales go to our distributors. They sell to their customers, and their customers sell to retail. So you'll always see the discrepancy between Nielsen, which is retail sales, and our own sales. And what I've always advised is the real test is not what we're selling, but the real test is what's coming off the shelves.
Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Yeah, with regard to China, we've just really focused on the top cities. There was probably a little bit of additional inventory in the pipeline and, with distributors from last year going into summer, which we needed to work through, and our distributors to work through because we didn't – in order to get them fresh inventory. We've done it under the cap promotion this summer in China, which has done nicely, and we are slowly starting to build up some core repeat business and consumers focused on the modern trade in the top, I think, as we said, 40 cities. So it's a slow build. It's steady. We are planning to launch Monster Ultra in China later this year and to roll it out again slowly. It won't be in all the business units initially. It will be in the business units where we feel they're able to handle it better. So we do have some plans to expand the product line with an additional launch next summer early in 2019. We believe this is – it is sort of appropriate and necessary for us. It'll help us, we think, get visibility for our brand on the shelves, which is one of the things we've referred to in earlier calls is it's been hard for us to have a smaller sized can and get recognized with a single can in stores, and particularly in Coke coolers where some of the Coke products have similar size cans. So we believe that the additional products will continue to help build the brand. So we're pretty positive on the build in China, but it is going to be a long, slow build. But ultimately, we think that the brand is going to continue to do well, and as we've said, the new products we've done some initial taste tests of them. They've been very well received. So we're pretty excited. The first product will be Ultra, and the next product will be our Mango Loco product for China.
Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Yeah, I think the only thing I would add to that, Mark, is that remember we were rolling out China last year. So there was a buildup of inventory gain to the system last year. And Japan was good in the quarter. Korea was good in the quarter. So overall, I think we were satisfied with the numbers bearing in mind the differences in various countries.
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yeah, thanks, and good afternoon, everyone.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi, Nik.
Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hi. A modeling question and then another question. On modeling, can you just – I know you don't want to give guidance for margins, et cetera, but just to help us think about it going forward, can you just rank order the factors weighing on gross margins kind of most impactful to least just to give us a better understanding? Because I guess when we look at the P&L and we look at the year-ago compares, promotional allowances are always listed first when you talk about gross margin pressure, and I know we're going to start lapping some of the Java promotional dollars as you are getting it back on the shelf. So that's the first question on gross margin. And then the second, the bigger picture question is, at the shareholder meeting, you talked about talking to the Coca-Cola Company about Mutant and potentially a new arrangement around that brand, and I just wanted to know if there is any progress there? Thanks.
Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Okay. Well, if I could just answer the first question. Remember on a previous call, I spoke about a personal view about margins what I felt about personally. So if you go back to the number that I gave you then and you look at this quarter, you adjust for ASC 606, and you adjust for the issues that we have had to sustain in increased aluminum prices relating to increases in aluminum can purchases, you'll find that the number is just kind of within – is in that number. So the margin adjusting for those two factors alone was just above 62%. So while we talk about promotional answers and that is a fact and, yes, promotional answers are up, and one of the big reasons for that is increased shelf costs and cooler placement fees. There is a reduction in margin as we continue to sell products such as the coffee product, Muscle Monster, Caffé Monster that are lower than the Monster cold food products. And then added to that, you have the issue of international sales where the margins are not as high as the U.S. margins. So I hope that's given you a good feel about the margin structure.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Only thing I would add on to the margins is in addition, there's also been a switch between the proportion between we have strategic brands which have concentrated models which have higher margins and Monster. And Monster is continuing to grow ahead of the strategic brand, so that continues to put some pressure on the margin as well. So you take all those three factors on product mix, geographic mix, and mix between the actual product, the Monster versus strategic brands and that has had that effect.
Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: So what I'm looking at here is that if you rank them in order, the point that Rodney mentioned was kind of at the bottom. So you've got all those other factors, plus you've got the strategic brands Monster percentages. And that should give you a full explanation to your question.
Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Very helpful. And then on Mutant?
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: On Mutant, we have not made progress with the Coke Company on a different model. We're sort of reevaluating Mutant. We think that Mutant in the U.S. is probably something that's – we're probably going to tailor off and sort of refocus our attention. We're actually spending we think too much time and effort on the brand, and we just don't feel that that's where we would be best spent going forward. So I think that we're going to focus on newer products. We have some additional new product lines and some positioning in the Monster brand in the U.S. I think we're going to focus on that. We will continue to – have regard to Mutant as I indicated earlier internationally as an energy brand and Predator depending on the different markets. But at this point, we just don't see the reward and payback for Mutant in the U.S., so that seems to be something that we're de-emphasizing and moving away from I think going forward.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you, all. Hi. Good afternoon, there. I just wanted to actually explore a little bit more on the pricing, first of all, if you're seeing any signs of potential moves from your competitors? And then if you can kind of elaborate more if you're thinking of pricing also internationally. I know the pressures from COGS are less so of aluminum, but perhaps because of some places where FX may be going the other way, it hasn't been the case of course for you guys, but if you see some room for international pricing as well. Thank you.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Well, we only really recently announced the pricing increase. Yeah, so we've really not really had any input back or heard anything back from our competitors. So we really can't give you much direction in that regard. We believe that they are undoubtedly also facing the same price and cost increases that we have, so we would believe that they probably will follow similarly, but we don't have any indication on that.
Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: And then internationally, as we've always advised, we are the smaller player in many international markets and we price according to the leading competitor. And we just have to ensure that we are priced correctly relative to that competitor to be able to capture a good share of the market. So we would not lead – necessarily lead internationally without the lead competitor going first.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: But that being said, with all of the uncertainty that's been happening in the world with the aluminum price and some other raw material price increases, we are keeping a watch in different countries. And as and when there are price adjustments by leading brands and other competitors in those markets, we will react to that and obviously look at the opportunities as well individually for taking up pricing as and when we think that that's appropriate. But we are certainly focusing initially now on the U.S. pricing, and then which is the largest impact on our business, and then we will look at – probably early in the New Year look at the international markets.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Thanks. Good evening, guys. I was hoping for a follow up on the pricing, and then maybe some commentary on India. The follow up on the pricing is just to what extent will the pricing that you announced cover the input cost inflation that you're seeing? Is it adequate to cover all of it? Is it a large portion of it? So commentary there would be helpful. And then help me just building on sounds like a loose guidance or (42:46) your personal view before with the 62%. We've seen this with the presence of negative geographic mix, promotion, et cetera. So in theory, while those things will still be present to some degree, pricing has not been obviously. So should we be thinking about something a little bit better than that 62% as we get into Q4 and then looking out to next year? And then, Rodney, a broader question on India. Maybe talk a little bit about sort of early indications there, and how you're defining success in that market? Thank you for all that.
Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Okay. So you're kind of getting greedy. The price increase should cover increases in input costs and the increases in freight. But who knows where they're going to go from there. I mean, today aluminum shot up again based on a number of factors. So as we sit here now, the pricing should contain our cost increases. Will we get more? I don't know, and I honestly I wouldn't consider even discussing more on this call because it's just too premature.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: If we increase pricing, I mean it's not going to have an effect through to us, certainly not in the current year. And then talking about India, we've had a controlled rollout, literally by city and surrounding region-by-region basis. It's gone well. We are seeing some good response. There is a recognition of the brand from when we were there many years before when we did sort of rollout and we were in India. We had a very limited presence but the brand was there, so we are seeing some recognition of the brand, which is good sort of very different to China where we really obviously had no brand recognition while we've launched. So it is different, and we are – but it really is premature. Hilton and I are both planning to go to India and review the markets and launch this ourselves personally within the next few months, but at this point it just is premature for us to comment on really what is happening there and how it's going. We're getting some good anecdotal reports but that's not sufficient for us to be comfortable to give you a direction from the company at this point yet.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thank you. Good luck.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session for today. So now it's my pleasure to hand the conference back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, for closing comments and remarks.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Thanks, everyone. On behalf of the company, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our strategy and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brands and expand the company both at home and abroad. And in particular, to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally. We are also particularly excited by the new opportunities that we have going through with our portfolio together with our strategic brands as well as Hydro, Mutant, and Predator in the affordable energy sector in many Eastern European, African, and other markets where that sector is continuing to show good growth opportunities. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude our program, and we may all disconnect. Everybody have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Corporation First Quarter 2018 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a Q-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently-available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these segments are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2018, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements for discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated May 8, 2018. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. Growth in the beverage industry globally continues to be challenging. However, there has been recent positive momentum in the energy category. Net sales for the 2018 first quarter were negatively impacted by $9.9 million due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606. Under ASC 606, commissions paid to The Coca-Cola Company based on our sales to certain of the company's customers which The Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method, or consolidates are now included as a reduction to net sales whereas prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method were included in operating expenses. In the first quarter, net sales were $850.9 million, up 14.7% from $742.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net sales in the first quarter were positively impacted by approximately $17.7 million of foreign currency movements. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 16%. The company recorded first quarter gross sales of $990.6 million, up 17.2% from the $845.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the first quarter were positively impacted by approximately $22.2 million of foreign currency movements. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the first quarter was 60.6% as compared to 64.8% for the comparable 2017 first quarter and 62.1% for the 2017 fourth quarter. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the gross profit percentage would have been 61%. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to: increases in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales; the $9.9 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction of net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606; geographical sales mix, our foreign operations generally have lower gross profit margins; a change in domestic product sales mix principally a higher percentage of sales of Java Monster, Caffé Monster, Espresso Monster and Hydro; increases in certain import costs principally freight-in aluminum cans and sucralose; Hydro production issues in the U.S. and EMEA, and certain increases in other costs. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.9% for the 2018 first quarter as compared to 3.1% in the 2017 first quarter largely due to higher carrier contract rates in the U.S. and increased distribution inefficiencies due to longer haul distances for certain products. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.5% compared to 11.7% in the same quarter a year ago. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 12.3% as compared to 14.4% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs was distributed termination expenses of $7 million for the 2018 first quarter as compared with $19.9 million in the comparable 2017 first quarter. In the quarter, payroll expenses were up $8.8 million compared to the same period last year primarily due to head count growth both domestically and internationally including to support the launches in China and other countries. Legal expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $1.7 million in the 2018 first quarter as compared to $1.9 million in the 2017 first quarter. Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China and India. The losses in India were due to establishment costs in advance of the launch which has continued to take longer than anticipated for regulatory reasons as well as due to inventory reserves. Our effective tax rates decreased from 32.8% in the 2017 first quarter to 23.3% in the 2018 first quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the Tax Reform Act signed into law on December 22, 2017. The decrease was partially offset by the elimination of certain deductions, specifically the domestic production deduction and decrease in stock-based compensation tax deduction. Net income was $216.1 million in the 2018 first quarter compared to net income of $178 million in the 2017 first quarter, an increase of 21.4%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 582 million for the first quarter of 2017 to 574.1 million for the first quarter of 2018 as a result of share repurchases, which I will cover later in this call. Diluted earnings per share for the 2018 first quarter increased 23.1% to $0.38 from $0.31 in the first quarter of 2017. Distributed terminations were $7 million in this quarter or approximately $0.01 per diluted share after-tax. We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. We're also making good progress in the U.S. in nontraditional channels including foodservice, accounts and e-commerce. In the first quarter of 2018, in the U.S., we have now fully transitioned the state of Minnesota. In EMEA, launches are planned in the second and third quarters of 2018 in Azerbaijan, Belarus, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Tanzania. We plan to launch Predator in 2018 as an affordable energy brand in selected Eastern European and African markets. During the first quarter of 2018, we launched Monster in Argentina and are planning to launch Monster in Ecuador and Uruguay later this year. In China, we continue to focus our efforts towards establishing Monster around the country, with an emphasis on distribution in the top 40 cities and to key accounts, targeting the younger and more affluent consumer demographic. We have commenced shipments of Monster to Coca-Cola India where we launched Monster in April in a lead market. We plan to expand the distribution and sales of Monster in India more extensively later this year. Mutant, one of our affordable energy brand that is positioned differently than in the U.S., was recently launched in Pakistan and Cambodia and is planned to be launched in Vietnam and Myanmar later this year. According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through March 31, 2018, all outlets combined, namely, convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including Energy Shots increased by 4.8% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 13.7% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 6.1% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 1.2%, sales of Red Bull increased 1.3%, sales of Rockstar decreased by 2.6%, sales of 5-Hour decreased 6.6%, and sales of Amp decreased 19.6%. According to Nielsen, for the five weeks ended March 31, 2018, sales in the convenience and gas channel including Energy Shots in dollars increased 5.6% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 14.7% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 5.9% and Full Throttle was up 0.8%. Sales of Red Bull were up 2.6%, Rockstar was down 5.6%, 5-Hour was down 6.6%, and Amp was down 21.8%. According to Nielsen, for the five weeks ended March 31, 2018 Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel including energy shots in dollars increased by 3 points over the same period last year to 37.8%. NOS's share remained the same at 4.2%, and Full Throttle's share remained the same at 1%. Red Bull's share decreased 1 point to 35%, Rockstar's share was down 0.8 of a point to 7.1%, 5-Hour's share was lower by 0.9 points at 6.7%, and Amp's share decreased by 0.3 of 1 point to 0.9%. According to Nielsen, for the five weeks ended March 31, 2018, sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks, which now includes Caffé Monster and Espresso Monster in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 19.3% over the same period last year. Sales of our Java Monster alone were 26.1% higher than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy was 6.2% lower. Our shares of coffee + energy category which we define as including Java Monster, Caffé Monster, Espresso Monster, Starbucks Doubleshot and Rockstar Roasted for the five weeks ended March 31, 2018 was 56.6%, up 11.7 points. Java Monster's share alone for the five weeks ended March 31, 2018 was 47.6%, up 2.6 points, while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy's share was 43.1%, down 11.7 points. The production capacity shortages that we experienced in the second half of 2016 for both Java Monster and Muscle Monster were largely worked through by the fourth quarter of 2017. Both Java Monster and Muscle Monster came up for allocation by the end of that quarter. Together with our bottling partners, we are currently focused on regaining lost shelf space for these products. According to Nielsen in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended March 31, 2018, the Energy Drink category increased 6% in dollars. Monster sales increased 15% versus a year ago. Monster's market share increased 2.5 share points to 33%. NOS's sales increased 8% and its market share increased 0.1 of a share point to 2.9%. Full Throttle's sales increased 22% and its market share increased by 0.2 of a point to 1.6%. Red Bull sales increased 5% and its market share decreased 0.4 of a point to 35.5%. Rockstar's sales decreased 4% and its market share decreased 1.8 points to 17.6%. According to Nielsen for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 17.6% during the month of March 2018. Monster sales increased 20.7%. Our market share in value increased 0.7 points to 29% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 13.8%. Burn's market share decreased 0.7 points to 2%. Red Bull sales increased 5.9% and its market share decreased by 1.3 points to 11.4%. Vive 100 sales increased 12.7% and its market share decreased 1.6 points to 37.2%, while Boost's market share decreased 0.3 of a point to 8.3%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced, positively and/or negatively, by sales in the OXXO Convenience chain which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO Convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities put a very significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. I'd like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ending March 2018, Monster's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period last year, grew from 10.5% to 11.5% in Belgium, from 11.8% to 12% in Czech Republic, from 23.7% to 27.1% in France, from 15.6% to 18.7% in Great Britain, from 31.2% to 31.8% in Greece, from 10% to 14.1% in Italy, from 5.2% to 7% in the Netherlands, from 11.6% to 16.2% in Norway, from 6.5% to 8.3% in Poland, from 26.4% to 29.1% in Spain, and from 10.6% to 11.8% in Sweden. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ending February 2018, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year increased from 10.3% to 13.7% in Ireland. For the 13-week period ended March 2018, Monster's retail market share in value decreased, however, from 16.1% to 16% in Germany, and from 16.8% to 15.3% in South Africa, although sales were up in both countries. According to Nielsen for the month of March 2018 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 28.4% to 34.4% compared to the same period last year, and Monster's market share in value in Brazil for the month of March 2018 increased from 7.4% to 14.9% as compared to the same period last year. According to IRI in Australia, Monster's market share in value grew from 7.1% to 9.1% in March 2018, as compared to the same period last year. According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the last four weeks ended March 18, 2018 grew from 5.7% to 6.4% as compared to the same period last year. According to Nielsen in South Korea, Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined grew from 25.1% to 30.9% in the first quarter of 2018 versus the same period last year. According to INTAGE, Monster's market share value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 44.9% to 45.9% in the first quarter of 2018 versus the same period last year. We, again, point out that certain market statistics that cover single months may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those months. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the first quarter of 2018 increased 16.7% from $668.6 million to $780.5 million from the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the 2018 first quarter were negatively impacted by $3.9 million due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment would have been 17.3%. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the first quarter of 2018 were positively impacted by approximately $15.4 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the Strategic Brand segment was $65.8 million for the first quarter as compared to $68 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the Strategic Brand segment for the first quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by $6 million due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase in sales for the Strategic Brand segment would have been 5.6%. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brand segment in the first quarter of 2018 were positively impacted by approximately $2.3 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. Net sales for the other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $4.7 million in the first quarter, as compared to $5.5 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $242.1 million in the 2018 first quarter, compared to $190.9 million in the corresponding quarter in 2017. Foreign exchange had the effect of increasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $17.7 million. (00:20:15) reported geographic sales or our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the first quarter increased 30.5% in dollars and 16.6% in local currencies, as the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase would have been 37.2% in net sales and 23.2% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region, as a percentage of net sales for the quarter, was 44.5%, compared to 50.3% in the same quarter last year and 47.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 47.2% for the first quarter. Gross profit in the region was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales. We're pleased with the rollout of additional SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In the first quarter of 2018, we introduced Ultra Citron in the Netherlands and Ultra Violet in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Various SKUs in the Ultra line are now sold in 38 EMEA markets. We are also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gained market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain and Sweden. In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the first quarter increased 18.9% in dollars and 14.2% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase would have been 21.3% in dollars and 16.6% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 42.8% versus 47.7% over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 44%. The decrease in gross profit percentage was also impacted by a higher percentage of Monster sales. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 54.6% or 49.3% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. In South Korea, net sales increased 22.9%, or 13.5% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 5.5% or 1% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the first quarter increased 37.7% in dollars and 34.5% in local currencies over the same period last year. Without the adoption of ASC 606, the percentage increase would have been 39.4% in dollars and 36.2% in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 46.5% versus 48.8% over the same period last year and 47.1% in the 2017 fourth quarter. Without the adoption of ASC 606, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 47.2%. Net sales increased in Brazil by 86.1% in dollars and 88.2% in local currency largely due to the continued performance of Monster Energy drinks. Net sales in Chile increased 27.9% in dollars and 20% in local currency. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $511.4 million compared to $528.6 million at December 31, 2017. Short-term investments were $585.2 million compared to $672.9 million at December 31, 2017. Long-term investments were $33.5 million compared to $2.4 million at December 31, 2017. Accounts receivable increased to $525.5 million at March 31, 2018, from $449.5 million at December 31, 2017. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 48.1 days compared to 43.8 days at December 31, 2017. Inventories increased to $268.6 million from $255.7 million at December 31, 2017. Average days of inventory was 71.7 days at March 31, 2018, compared to 75 days at December 31, 2017. In the first quarter of 2018, we launched Caffé Monster, a ready to drink energy coffee in 13.7-ounce glass bottles in three flavors, relaunched Muscle Monster in a 15-ounce plastic bottle in two flavors and launched Rehab White Dragon Tea. We rebranded our two Monster Extra Strength SKUs into the Monster MAXX line and added an additional SKU. We also expanded Monster Hydro into a resealable 25.4-ounce bottle with three new flavors. In Canada in the first quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Energy Ultra Violet and Monster Hydro in a 550-mL PET bottle in three flavors as well as Full Throttle orange in 16-ounce cans. In EMEA we launched Monster Hydro in 550-mL PET bottles in Sweden in January 2018 and in Germany in March 2018. In the first quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Mango Loco in the United Kingdom and Sweden along with Monster Pipeline Punch in the United Kingdom and Belgium. We also recently launched Mutant as an affordable energy brand in Pakistan and Cambodia. We launched Ultra White in Hong Kong and Macau in the first quarter of 2018. In the second quarter of 2018, we will launch Monster Ultra Citron in Korea along with Cuba Libre in Japan. We launched the Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy Drink in Australia and New Zealand in the 2018 first quarter. We estimate April 2018 gross sales to be approximately 18.9% higher than in April of 2017. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate April 2018 gross sales will be approximately 16.1% higher than in April 2017. Please note that the impact of ASC 606 has not been included in determining these figures. April had one extra selling day. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances where our bottles are responsible for production and unilaterally determined their production schedules, which affects the dates in which we invoice as bottlers, as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even two months should not be necessarily imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. During the 2018 first quarter, the company purchased approximately 4.3 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $57.74 per share for a total of $249.9 million, excluding broker commissions. In February 2018, the company's board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the purchase of up to $250 million of the company's outstanding common stock. No shares have been repurchased pursuant to the February 2018 repurchase program. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. The company continued to achieve record market shares in the U.S. and many countries. Retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in line with earlier periods. New additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We're excited about the prospects for our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India despite operating losses recorded during the quarter for China and India of approximately $2.8 million. We are continuing to launch Monster Energy Drinks with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain markets. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Vivien Azer from Cowen. Your line is now open.
Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi. Afternoon.
Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: So, Hilton, I know you say you don't give guidance, but you did offer some kind of personal color on the fourth quarter call around expectations for gross margin where I think – where you guys settled out in the first quarter did fall short of that and I think will prove to be disappointing to investors. So can you just help talk us through where, relative to your fourth quarter commentary, gross margin missed your personal expectations? Thank you.
Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Sure, sure. In the last conference call, I did give my personal views on percentage gross margins going forward. I said that while the company does not give guidance, my personal view was to use the gross margin for the 2017 fourth quarter of 62.1% going forward. There are, of course, many factors that go into gross margin, some of which are one-off costs and some of which may well be ongoing as we experienced in Q1. Looking forward, again, the company does not give guidance. But it is important to bear in mind what's happening with aluminum, which can fluctuate significantly even within a day. The Midwest, premium, freights, fuel issues, promotional allowances, geographic sales mix, domestic product sales mix, continuing investments in China and India, and so it's extremely difficult to talk about a sustainable gross profit margin percentage when there are many non-controllable factors. So we really are not in a position to give any further guidance on gross margins. On the other hand, we are continuing to progress production efficiencies and we continue to review pricing on an ongoing basis.
Operator: Thanks. And our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi, Dara.
Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So, Hilton, following up on that comment on pricing, I guess we've seen price increases in this category during times of margin pressure in the past. And given the significant gross margin depression the last couple quarters and the continued commodity cost runoff, do you think you might look to take price increases in the U.S. at some point? And how do you guys think through the puts and takes of taking price increases? Thanks.
Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: What I said was we continue to review pricing on an ongoing basis, and we do this irrespective of margin pressures. Obviously, when we do have margin pressures, it's something that surfaces again, and it's something that we are continually reviewing. And more than that, I just don't want to say at this time.
Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then could you guys talk about the health of the energy drink category in the U.S.? You mentioned weak beverage growth trends in general across the sector, but seemed more positive on the energy category. So where do things stand there and any worries about the potential impact on gas, convenience from the rising gas prices?
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Last year, sort of, I think the whole industry was at a bit of a loss to understand why the convenience category had been growing, which had historically grown ahead of all markets, had sort of changed and started to slow down. What we're starting to see now is that the convenience category has really come back and is now growing ahead of the all measured channels. And so I think that we are starting to see this trend, which is quite encouraging. So I think we referred to some of the numbers. I'm just trying to think. The convenience was up 4.6% in the last 13 weeks, and I think it was up a little higher in the last five weeks.
Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: 5.6%.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: 5.6%. So it certainly is moving in the right direction and starting to solidify and gain traction again.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks. Good afternoon.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Afternoon.
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. So could I go to the international? Can you speak about international growth? Because if you exclude the 2% inventory benefit that you highlighted in the January sales, it seems that your underlying sales internationally could have decelerated again to the high-single digit range. Is that what we should expect for a normalized rate of growth going forward?
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Well, I don't think it's gone down to the high-single digits, and I think we did explain and drew the distinction in the markets to some of the geographic sales mix which also affected sales. If you look at the figures we gave you for Strategic Brands, which was down in dollars and marginally up, that has had a drag on our sales. The Monster sales internationally are still continuing to grow on quite a healthy basis.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic from SIG. Your line is now open.
Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Thank you. Hilton and Rodney, look, I just want some big picture comments in terms of gross margins. I mean, a number of companies in the industry are facing what they call cyclical gross margin issues with aluminum lags and increasing prices. In your case, it seems to me that you face secular issues also going from single cans to pack sizes in the U.S., growing faster overseas than domestically. I mean, in China, your prices are much lower. So I don't know if it's possible, but if you could just help us understand in terms of these declining gross margins we're seeing, how much could we consider cyclical and how much will be secular? And the second question which is related to this. Other companies like, say, Buffalo, their gross margin story will be that they will bring in a lot of production in-house from third-party manufacturers. In your case, I've never really understood if there is such a story. I mean as you move distribution to the Coke system, is there an opportunity there to also shift production, or those bottlers were already producing your products? So just help us understand how much leeway or opportunity you have there in terms of structural changes that could help profitability and gross margins. And the very last one on the same topic...
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Wait. Wait. Wait. You're now going on to the third question. We've lost track of the first one.
Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: (37:19).
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: No, no, go on. We're supposed to have one question at a time. Okay. So let's just – let me just start with production. All of our products of Coke PET we have a finished product model that's not going to change. What will change is as we continue to align ourselves with the Coke bottlers, we will continue to increase production sites with those Coke bottlers in their countries and in their markets, which will have the effect of reducing costs, of reducing freight, reducing import duties, and so that will benefit and continue to improve. There isn't any plan to change that. In the Strategic Brands, they are already being manufactured by Coke because the model for the Strategic Brands segment is pretty much a concentrate model. Where there are some products in the Strategic Brands where the Coke bottlers can't manufacture them; for example, a 24-ounce cap can for NOS in the U.S., we then are selling that product on a finished product basis. And that accounts for a little bit lower product of gross margin for us because we're obviously in the one case selling concentrate at a higher margin and in the other case we are selling a finished product which does have a lower gross margin just because of the economics and the law of numbers. So that's on the margin side. So we will continue to achieve production efficiencies. We will lower costs by improving our production and increasing the number of plants. That is also particularly so with regard to the newer products like Hydro. As you know, we experienced some production increases in coffee product because we were having to import product. We are still importing Espresso Monster, but we are looking to convert that to local production, which will again – which will assist in costs. And as we start ramping up with Caffé Monster and others, we are looking to improve efficiencies in Hydro, which is really manufactured in the Northeast now. We're looking to – in bottles and in Carolina for the cans, we are looking to increase facilities coming on board which will reduce costs. Could you take the first question, Hilton?
Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: I'm not...
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: You don't know what the first question was. Do you want to repeat your first question? Hello?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Freda Zhuo - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. This is actually Freda Zhuo on for Judy. Thanks so much for taking my questions.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi.
Freda Zhuo - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So my question is actually on China. So I think if you look at some of the channel data, it seems as though category growth has kind of taken a step down in 2018 closer to the 10% range. Can you talk about what you're seeing on the ground in terms of what might be driving some of that slower category growth? And then I caught a comment that you guys were repositioning or perhaps targeting some of the younger, more affluent demographics. So is that impacting the price point that you're placing Monster at in the market? Thanks.
Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Okay. No, we're continuing with our price strategy, which was to remain competitive with Red Bull Gold, the Thai Red Bull. So that strategy is continuing. Our strategy is to maintain our products adjacent to Red Bull and to have what we call 3P execution, which is pricing competitive with Red Bull, point-of-sale, and position on shelf. So that is the target that we have set our bottlers, and we're moving forward in those accounts where we believe that we can achieve good sustainable sales. And our bottlers – I've just come back from China – have set themselves an objective of focusing and trying to achieve what we have succeeded and what we succeeded initially in the U.S. is to develop an energy shelf so that Chinese consumers can go to a shelf and select an energy drink. When our product is placed in a Coca-Cola cooler adjacent to a Coke and a Sprite, it doesn't help the consumer understand what the product is. So we are proceeding down our strategy, which we are supporting with a range of marketing media and social media. We've got a major computer game program that we are tying in with called Battleground, which is a significant property. We're moving forward on that strategy this year. So we always said that China would be a long-term development, and we're just staying the course.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Yeah. Just to – perhaps, if I would just add to that. Obviously, one of the challenges we're still having is the level of execution or quality of execution from the bottlers to execute the 3P that Hilton just alluded to, and that continues to be an ongoing challenge. We have seconded some of our key staff from the U.S. to really try and educate them and actually be able to really direct them and show them what we need to do. And we're confident that we will get it done, but it's a longer and harder road, and it will be achieved, and we will get there. With regard to the demographic, while we talk about the younger and more affluent, there hasn't been a change. In China, we have our product. It's carbonated. Our researchers indicated that younger consumers do prefer a carbonated product, and we've distinguished ourselves from Red Bull, which is a still product Thai Red Bull in China, and we believe that we're continuing with that strategy. The pricing is premium in that it's not as premium as our product in the rest of the world and it is aligned with Red Bull China, but that is at a premium to some of the other energy drinks and certainly soft drinks. So that just will continue and that continues to be our strategy. There's been no change in our strategy. The challenge is just again getting the recognition for Monster in China that is at a lower level because of the social media fact that you don't have as much access to – the consumer doesn't have access to Facebook and YouTube that they have around the rest of the world. And we are improving and, obviously, taking steps to start getting the consumer more familiar with us through the local social media companies that have the equivalent channels and programs in China.
Operator: And this ends the Q&A portion of the call. I would now like to turn it back to Rodney Sacks for any further remarks.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to develop, differentiate our brand, and to expand the company both at home and abroad, and in particular, to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally. We are also particularly excited about the new opportunities that we have going forward with the portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world comprised of our Monster Energy brand together with the Strategic Brands, as well as Hydro and Mutant. I hope to see you all at the Annual Stockholders Meeting in Corona on June 7, 2018, at 2:00 PM. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference call. This concludes today's program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2017 Q4  (2018-02-28 17:00:00) =====

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Corporation fourth quarter and full-year 2017 financial results conference call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Please begin.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I'd like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27-A of the Securities Act of 1953 as amended, and Section 21-E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1954 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends.

An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the consolidated statements of income and other information, attached to the earnings release dated February 28, 2018. A copy of this information is also available on our website at www.monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. Global beverage industry generally continues to face headwinds, although the energy category continues to gain momentum. In the fourth quarter, net sales were $810.4 million, up 7.5% from $753.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net sales in the fourth quarter were positively impacted by approximately $7.3 million of foreign currency movements. The company recorded fourth quarter gross sales of $954.8 million, up 10.1% from $848.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross sales in the fourth quarter were positively impacted by approximately $9.3 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales and gross sales in the fourth quarter were adversely affected by inventory reductions in the quarter by certain of our international distribution partners in Europe, Chile and Japan. We estimate that the impact of such inventory reductions was approximately 2% on net sales in the 2017 fourth quarter. The actual impact on net sales and gross sales could differ significantly from the current estimate which includes estimates of certain distributors' own inventory levels. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the fourth quarter were 62.1% as compared to 66.1% for the comparable 2016 fourth quarter and 62.6% for the 2017 third quarter. As a reminder, lower promotional allowances as a percentage of sales in the 2016 fourth quarter together with the reduction in Java Monster sales had the effect of increasing the gross profit percentage by approximately 2% in the 2016 fourth quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2017 fourth quarter compared to the 2016 fourth quarter was primarily attributable to sales mix, primarily increased sales of Java Monster, inventory reserves in China, lower allowances as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter of 2016, as well as the increases in other costs, primarily increases in sweeteners and aluminum cans, as well as logistical costs from imports. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.6% for the 2017 fourth quarter as compared to 3.2% in the 2016 fourth quarter, largely due to distribution inefficiencies with certain products as well as duplicative storage costs due to the transition to our new 1 million square foot warehouse and distribution center in Southern California. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 13.6% compared to 12% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs, advertising, mainly for NOS, increased costs relating to in-store demos, merchandise displays, commissions, and trade development. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.9% as compared to 17.5% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributor termination expenses of $46.3 million in the comparable 2016 fourth quarter. General and administrative costs excluding distributor terminations were 11.4% of net sales for the comparable 2016 fourth quarter. In the quarter, payroll expenses were up $10.8 million compared to the same period last year, primarily due to head count growth both domestically and internationally, including to support the launches in China and other countries. Payroll taxes increased $3.5 million in the quarter compared to the same period a year ago. And stock-based compensation, a non-cash item, was $0.9 million higher. Legal expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety, and sale of the company's products were $2.5 million in the 2017 fourth quarter as compared to $5.1 million in the 2016 fourth quarter. Operating income was adversely affected by losses in China and India. The losses in India were due to establishment costs in advance of the launch, which has taken longer than anticipated for technical reason, as well as inventory reserves. Our effective tax rate decreased from 29.9% in the 2016 fourth quarter to 24.8% in the 2017 fourth quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to an increase in the stock compensation deduction. The amount of excess tax benefits recorded in income for the 2017 fourth quarter was $82.9 million compared with $13.7 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by a provisional charge of $39.8 million included in the provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a $2.1 million charge for a one-time deemed mandatory repatriation of post-1986 earnings and profits as a result of the Tax Reform Act signed into law on December 22, 2017. Under the Tax Reform Act, the U.S. corporate income tax rate will be reduced from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018. The provisional charge was attributable to the revaluation by the company of its net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017. Net income was $201.3 million in the 2017 fourth quarter compared to net income of $172.9 million in the 2016 fourth quarter, an increase of 16.4%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 580.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 to 575 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of share buybacks. Diluted earnings per share for the 2017 fourth quarter increased 17.5% to $0.35 from $0.30 in the fourth quarter of 2016. We estimate that distributor termination expenses in the comparable 2016 fourth quarter reduced reported earnings by approximately $0.05 per share after tax. We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. We're also making good progress in the U.S. in non-traditional channels, including foodservice accounts and e-commerce. In the U.S., we transitioned Monster in parts of Minnesota and Arkansas. And with the recent transition in the first quarter of 2018, Minnesota is now fully transitioned to Coca-Cola bottlers. In EMEA, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Ghana and Morocco in the fourth quarter of 2017. Additional launches are planned in the first quarter of 2018 in Armenia, Belarus, and Tanzania. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in the Bahamas and Grenada, as well as in Jamaica with an independent bottler. We plan to launch Monster in Argentina in the first quarter of 2018 and in Ecuador and Uruguay during the second quarter of 2018. In China, we are now focusing our efforts towards establishing Monster around the country, with an emphasis on key cities and accounts. We also transitioned Monster Energy in Vietnam and have begun distribution of Monster Energy in Taiwan. We're also planning to relaunch Monster in India, initially in a limited territory, and are currently engaged in production trials. We recorded a loss for the quarter in India, which I referred to earlier. We plan to launch Mutant, an affordable energy brand that is positioned differently than in the U.S., where Mutant is positioned as a Super Soda, in Pakistan, Cambodia, Myanmar, and Vietnam in 2018. Raw material cost savings from the AFF transaction were approximately $25.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through February 17, 2018, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 4.5% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 12.2% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 5.5% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 2.8%. Sales of Red Bull increased 2.8%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 0.1%. Sales of 5-Hour decreased 7.3%, and sales of Amp decreased 22.4%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended February 17, 2018, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased 4.3% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 13.9% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 5.9% and Full Throttle sales decreased 1.4%. Sales of Red Bull were flat, Rockstar was down 2.4%, 5-Hour was down 8.4%, and Amp was down 15.5%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended February 17, 2018, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 3.2 points over the same period last year to 38.1%. NOS's share increased by 0.1 points to 4.3% and Full Throttle's share decreased 0.1 points to 1%. Red Bull's share decreased 1.4 points to 34.1%, Rockstar's share was down 0.5 points to 7.6%, 5-Hour's share was lower by 0.9 points at 6.6% and Amp's share decreased 0.3 points to 1.1%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended February 17, 2018, sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 8.8% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 26.9% higher than the same period last year while sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy were 8% lower. The production capacity shortages that we experienced in the second half of 2016 for both Java Monster and Muscle Monster were largely worked through by the fourth quarter of 2017. Both Java Monster and Muscle Monster came off allocation in the quarter. Together with our bottling partners we are currently focused on regaining lost shelf space for these products. According to Nielsen in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended February 3, 2018, the energy drink category increased 8% in dollars. Monster sales increased 14% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 1.7 share points to 32.4%. NOS's sales increased 65% and its market share increased 1.1 points to 3.1%. Full Throttle sales increased 45% and its market share increased 0.4 of a point to 1.6%. Red Bull sales increased 5% and its market share decreased 1.3 points to 35.8%. Rockstar's sales increased 3% and its market share decreased 0.7 of a point to 18%. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 3.3% during the month of January 2018. Monster sales increased 21.5%. Our market share in value increased 4.8 points to 31.7% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 39.7%. Burn's market share decreased 1.2 points to 1.7%. Red Bull sales decreased 7.4% and its market share decreased by 1.4 points to 11.8%. Vive 100 sales decreased 9.6% and its market share decreased 4.6 points to 31.9% while Boost's market share decreased 1.1 points to 11.9%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ending January 2018, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year, grew from 15.9% to 18.8% in Great Britain, from 27.4% to 28.6% in Spain, and in France, from 22.5% to 25.5%. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ending December 2017, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 10.7% to 11.6% in Belgium. From 10.1% to 13.9% in Ireland, from 10.9% to 11% in Sweden. From 5% to 7.1% in the Netherlands, from 15.1% to 15.9% in Germany, from 10.8% to 15.7% in Norway, and from 31.5% to 33.5% in Greece and from 8.8% to 13.5% in Italy. For the 13-week period ended December 2017, Monster's retail market share in value decreased, however, from 16.1% to 14.9% in South Africa, although the retail value sales actually grew 10.6% in the same comparative period. And from 12% to 11.3% in the Czech Republic although retail value sales grew 0.8% in the same comparative period. I'd like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers for EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI for EMEA vary from country-to-country. According to Nielsen for the month of December 2017 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 26.1% to 33.2% compared to the same period last year. And Monster's market share in value in Brazil for the month of December increased from 5% to 15.2% as compared to the same period last year. According to IRI in Australia, Monster's market share in value grew from 6.3% to 7.1% in December 2017, as compared to the same period last year. According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the last four weeks ended December 24, 2017 grew from 5.3% to 6.4% as compared to the same period last year. According to Nielsen in South Korea, Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined grew from 22.7% to 26.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus the same period last year. According to INTAGE, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 41.6% to 44.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus the same period last year. We will again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those months. Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 7.6% from $684.4 million to $736.1 million from the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy drinks segment in the fourth quarter were positively impacted by approximately $5.8 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the strategic brand segment were $69.6 million for the fourth quarter as compared to $64.5 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the company's strategic brand segment were positively impacted by approximately $1.5 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. Net sales for the other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $4.7 million in both the 2017 and 2016 fourth quarters. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $210.4 million in the 2017 fourth quarter compared to $193.5 million in the corresponding quarter in 2016. Foreign exchange had the effect of increasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $7.3 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, net sales for the fourth quarter increased 10.2% in dollars and 4.1% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 47.5% compared to 52.8% in the same quarter last year and 50.9% in the third quarter of 2017, in part due to increases in raw materials, aluminum and co-packing costs, as well as lower allowances as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in sales in the fourth quarter in EMEA was negatively affected by inventory reductions at the end of the quarter by our largest distribution partner in the region. The inventory reductions resulted in substantially higher sales to that distribution partner in January 2018 as compared to January 2017. It is significant to note that sales out by our distribution partners to customers in the quarter increased by approximately 24% in EMEA, which was in line with the retail sales reported by Nielsen and IRI for that period. We are pleased with the rollout of certain SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In 2017, we added certain SKUs of Ultra across EMEA with the introduction of Ultra Citron, which is now available in 10 additional EMEA markets in 2017. Various SKUs in the Ultra range are now sold in 35 EMEA markets. We are also pleased that Monster continued to perform well and gained market share in Belgium, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and Spain. In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the fourth quarter decreased 5.3% in dollars and 1.9% in local currencies over the same period last year, mainly due to a correction in inventories by our bottler partners in China. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 32.4% versus 44.1% over the same period last year, largely driven by product reserves in China and India. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 2.2%, or 10% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year, due to the timing of production which effectively resulted in a reduction in inventory by our distribution partner at the end of the fourth quarter. As with a number of our other overseas distributors, sales by our distributor to the retail trade and retail sales to consumers remained strong and in line with earlier periods. In South Korea, net sales increased 43.1% or 44.9% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, and Guam, net sales increased 25.2%, or 23.2% in local currencies, as compared to the same quarter last year. As previously mentioned, we are engaged in production trials in India with a view towards reentering the market, initially in a limited territory. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, gross sales in the fourth quarter increased 25.5% in dollars and 21.4% in local currencies. Net sales in the fourth quarter increased 18.9% in dollars and 14.4% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 47.1% versus 52.5% over the same period last year and 47.6% in the 2017 third quarter. The decrease in gross profit was in part due to a decrease in sales of Burn in Brazil and Mexico as well as product returns in Peru. In Mexico, promotional allowances were higher in the fourth quarter of 2017 relative to the same quarter in 2016. Net sales increased in Brazil by 82.8% in dollars or 79.3% in local currency, largely due to the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took place on November 1, 2016. Net sales in Chile increased 1.8% in dollars but decreased 3.8% in local currency, primarily due to inventory reductions by our Coca-Cola distributors in the fourth quarter. Sales to the retail trade by our distributors in the fourth quarter increased by approximately 49% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $528.6 million compared to $377.6 million at December 31, 2016. Short-term investments were $672.9 million compared to $220.6 million at December 31, 2016. Long-term investments were $2.4 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016. Accounts receivable increased to $449.5 million at December 31, 2017, from $448.1 million at December 31, 2016. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 43.8 days compared to 48.2 days at December 31, 2016. Inventories increased to $255.7 million from $162 million at December 31, 2016. Average days of inventory was 75 days at December 31, 2017, which includes increased inventories of Java Monster, as well as in advance of their launches, Caffé Monster and Muscle Monster in bottles, compared to 57 days at December 31, 2016. Monster Energy continues to innovate with new beverages and new packages. We launched Espresso Monster in two flavors and NOS Nitro Mango in the U.S. at the end of 2017. In the first quarter of 2018, we launched Caffé Monster, a ready-to-drink energy coffee in 13.7-ounce glass bottles in three flavors, and relaunched Muscle Monster in a 15-ounce plastic bottle in two flavors. In the first half of 2018, we plan on rebranding our two Monster extra strength SKUs into the Monster MAX line. Beginning in the second quarter of 2018, we will be discontinuing one of our two existing SKUs in this line and adding two new flavors. We are also launching Rehab White Dragon Tea. Finally capturing on the 2017 excitement of Monster Hydro in a 16.9-ounce can, we are expanding Monster Hydro into a re-sealable 25.4-ounce bottle and adding three new flavors. In Canada in the fourth quarter, we launched Monster Energy Ultraviolet with a large customer and also launched Mutant Super Soda nationwide. In the first quarter of 2018, we launched Monster Energy Ultraviolet nationwide and Monster Hydro in a 550 ml PET bottle in three flavors, as well as Full Throttle Orange in 16-ounce cans. We launched Monster Hydro in a 550 ml plastic bottle in United Kingdom, South Africa and Ireland during 2017. We also launched Monster Hydro in Sweden and Germany in the first quarter of 2018. We are launching Monster Energy Ultraviolet in the first quarter of 2018 in the Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom. The Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink launched in the second quarter 2017 and was available in 24 EMEA markets by the end of 2017. We are launching the Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink in Australia and New Zealand in the 2018 first quarter. We estimate January 2018 gross sales to be approximately 27.9% higher than in January 2017. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate January 2018 gross sales to be approximately 25.1% higher than in January 2017. In this regard, we estimate that less than half of such increase is attributable to A, the increase in January 2018 sales following inventory reductions by certain of our international distributors that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017; and B, initial shipments of Caffé Monster and Muscle Monster in bottles which were launched in January 2018. We caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores. Distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even longer, should not necessarily be imputed to, or regarded as indicative of, results for a full quarter or any future periods. On February 28, 2017, the company's board of directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. During the fourth quarter we purchased 0.02 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $54.99 per share for a total of $1.1 million excluding broker commissions, leaving a remaining authorization of approximately $250 million. On February 27, 2018, the Board authorized an additional repurchase program to bring the aggregate amount available to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, we recognize the reduction in raw material costs of $25.1 million in the fourth quarter as a result of our acquisition of AFF. Two, our gross margins remain healthy. Three, U.S. Nielsen convenience market statistics for the four weeks ended February 17, 2018, reflect that the company achieved its highest market share in the energy category in dollars, and at 42.9% market share including the strategic brands. And that the Monster Energy brand achieved its highest market share in the energy category at a 38.2% market share. Four, despite inventory reductions by certain of our international distributors, retail sales statistics from many countries around the world demonstrate that the Energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category in line with earlier periods. Five, the new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. Six, we're excited about the prospects for our new product launches. Seven, we are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China and India, despite operating losses recorded during the quarter for India and China of approximately $9 million. We have successfully launched or transitioned Monster Energy drinks to Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of markets last year, and anticipate further transitions and launches this year. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The first question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Your line is now open.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Good afternoon. Hi, Bill.
Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi, Bill. How are you?
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Just on the gross margin side, is the three factors that impacted the fourth quarter, China reserves, raw materials having higher material costs, and then the mix, would you expect kind of all of those to have a similar impact as we move into 2018 or any of them being mitigated? How should I look at especially on the higher material costs and how should I look at that in 2018?
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Well, the higher material costs we expect to continue, particularly for aluminum. I think, you've seen in the announcements that are in play regarding aluminum and aluminum costs, so we expect an increase in aluminum. Sweetener, we'll continue to experience costs in sweeteners this year, so the only factor that will possibly diminish is inventory reserves in China. Those we don't expect to continue.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Your line is open.
Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Hey. Good afternoon, guys.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi, Mark.
Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So I guess I wanted to ask about these inventory reserves. So what exactly is going on in China, I guess most specifically, but also why you're doing that in India? And then just sort of more broadly, I guess I get the moving parts on what you talked about from inventory reductions by bottlers outside of the U.S. but I guess if you look at it within the U.S. as well, the numbers were still on a reported basis lower than what the end demand or scanner data would have indicated. So I guess I'm curious how you're thinking about that. Is that catch-up? Did you over ship in prior quarters and sort of how did you think about that from an inventory standpoint now going forward?
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: I think, the issue in China was the demand was misjudged in summer and we ended up with excess inventory which we've needed to work through and we've made provisions for that. In India, we've also been running some test runs and trials, and we've been having some challenges in some of the testing of ingredient levels. They use a different testing set of tests for what we do and we use around the world, and we've been having a number of debates about what the testing levels are because we were comfortable with the ingredient levels that we put in, but yet they were coming out on testing levels because of the way they extrapolate the results a little differently. But yet, that is the method that is used in India, and that has caused us some hiccups and delays in getting going because we're just struggling with the testing levels. And that's resulted in, again, some inventory and stock write-offs. With regard to the scanner data in the U.S., I think there's been an increase in the scanner data more recently. I think the numbers are coming up. And I think that's just indicative of where the market has been, but it has improved from the latter part of last year.
Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: We've never said that there's a perfect science between our sales to our distributors and the sales at retail. But over a period of time, one does see the correlation. And then one other thing I wanted to add on India is there are some new can regulations, labeling regulations that are being put in place, which was another reason for certain reserves in India.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Right. I agree.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Hi. Good afternoon there. I just want to clarify. You obviously said that the impact of the extra inventory could be about less than 50%, so I'm trying to do the math. Would you say it's like in the mid-teens growth and then you had an extra selling day in January 2018? So what should we be thinking on a normalized basis like you will run through or run rate on the top line product to date? And then the other question is regarding your gross margin. I understand all the puts and takes. But in your view, you're still going to see pressure from these items into 20 – bigger pressure into 2018 on the gross margin, but it's mostly on a mix effect and on aluminum. But if you can help us guide us through the impacts, that would be great.
Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: So on the gross margin, we don't give guidance, and it's something that the company has never done. We give the information as we have it, as we see it through the quarter. But if you wanted a kind of gross margin, a conservative gross margin looking forward, I personally, and this is a personal feeling, I would just use the gross margin for the quarter.
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: That's helpful, thank you. And on the top line, I'm just trying to see it from the extra day, and obviously you said less than 50% impact. So I'm trying to reconcile the 25% or 27% FX-neutral on a quarter-to-date. Is that something we should be thinking on the mid-teens normalized days, or a bit less because of the extra day?
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: We actually described it as less than half. And the reason we did that was that what we don't know is – while there was, we believe, additional purchases by these distribution, by the distributors, we're not sure all of those additional purchases took place in January because we haven't done the analysis of specific SKUs and the purchases. And so we believe that it was less than 50%, but that is our best estimate on those numbers at this time.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Laurent Grandet of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yes, good evening, Rodney and Hilton. On the international business, how should we think about the right level of growth in the international segment? So 5% organic growth in the quarter seems extremely low. Would a yearly growth level at 25% be right, and the 30%-plus we saw in the first three quarters to be inflated by gradual increase of inventory? So I'm trying to figure out what is the right level of inventory in international to figure out the right growth level in that segment. Thank you.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Again, we described on this call what had happened with regard to inventory reductions. We also spoke about some issues with regard to China. We don't give guidance, but I think there's sufficient information for you to look at historical information and honestly make up your own estimates because we don't give guidance. It's really difficult to sit here and answer these questions where you guys are looking for guidance. We don't give guidance.
Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: And I think we did mention that. And that's why we actually have given a lot of the Nielsen information and sales out because that is less affected by purchases of inventory and timing and production timings. And so if you look at EMEA, which is probably our largest international market, we've given you, it's close to, Nielsen's are up in EMEA close to mid-20s. And we've given you Nielsen's for the other areas as well. So those were the numbers that are showing where we expect the numbers to continue. And so when we look at the demand in ongoing sales levels for internationally, they're pretty much in line with the Nielsen numbers and the numbers that have been reported by us in previous quarters. It's clearly a choppy quarter. But that's why we think that the sales out numbers, depletions from our distributors and the best number of all is, obviously, the sales into the markets, which are measured generally reasonably reliably measured by Nielsen are the numbers that you guys should be looking to going forward.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: And that's why we give these numbers.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Caroline Levy of Macquarie. Your line is open.
Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thanks, hi there. This is on distribution and selling expenses up as a percent of sales. Could you just explain to us in an environment where there's a shortage of truckers and distribution costs are going up, how it works for you guys? Are you all third party? Are your contracts longer term? And then on the selling side, how much of that big percentage increase versus sales was relating to the China India markets?
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: So on distribution costs, we relocated our warehousing to our new warehouse in California during the quarter, and that impacted distribution costs. Regarding trucking, we have our own fleet that we operate mainly for local markets, but we depend extensively on third-party trucking. And then, Caroline, your other question was how much of the distribution costs were related to China and India, and I don't have that to hand, I'm sorry. In India, obviously it wasn't much because we're still in production trials.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Thanks. Good evening, guys.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Good evening.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Two quick points of clarification just because the quarter was a little bit noisy with the distributor issues. So one, just to be very clear. It seems like it was just sort of a one-month issue that not only do you not expect it to persist, but it already seems like its begun to reverse out in the month of January. So if you could just clarify on that?
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Right.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: And then point number – okay. Perfect. And then question number two, it doesn't seem like there's anything quantitatively that changes your view on the outlook for your international business. The POS data, the Nielsen data sounds very, very strong. So if you could just confirm that and include it in that response, could you also include China and whether you have a change in view there and what the company's outlook, and what it's capable of achieving in that market? Thank you.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: I think that generally international is in line with Nielsen and what we've already indicated. We are comfortable with that and we think that basically our sales momentum remains intact for the brand. In the China market, that has been a challenging market, and it's been costly and we've incurred – obviously incurred losses. We knew we would do so, and your question is hard, and not dissimilar to any other companies who have entered the Chinese market. We are continuing to persist with it. We've obviously – we have the resources, we've put resources behind the brand. We've put marketing and promotion behind the brand. And those are continuing to obviously impact our bottom line. But we see those as long-term opportunities, and we've got to look to establishing the brand in the long-term in China. That's our objective and we are confident we'll get there, but we just got to have – it's going to take time to do so. And again, India we are – we don't believe India in the shorter term is as big a market or potential as China, but it also has just been again some ups and downs in getting going. We are confident that we will get going, but it has – we've set up with staff, we've set up with operations there, and that clearly has affected our bottom line. Those amounts will start eventually to improve as we continue to increase our sales and are able to manage our expenses in those countries more efficiently going forward.
Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Yes. I'd just like to add that the group that has worked with this company for a number of years will remember that it took a number of years for us to become profitable in Europe and in EMEA generally, and there are a lot of lessons that are being learned in China every day. We've got some of our own executive staff over there, on secondment, and our bottling partners are just very much on board and we haven't heard anything negative about the long-term potential for the brand from our partners.
Operator: Thank you and this concludes the Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Sacks for closing remarks.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brand and to expand the company both at home and abroad. And in particular, to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally. We're also particularly excited about the new opportunities we have going forward with a portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world, comprised of our Monster Energy brand together with the strategic brands and Mutant. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Good day, everyone.

A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. The global beverage industry generally continues to face headwinds although the energy category continues to gain momentum. In the third quarter, net sales were $909.5 million, up 15.4% from $788 million in the third quarter of 2016. The company recorded third quarter gross sales of $1.04 billion, up 14.1% from $913.3 million in the third quarter of 2016. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the third quarter was 62.6% as compared to 63.8% for the comparable 2016 third quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to geographic sales mix as our international operations generally have lower profit margins, product sales mix as well as the increases in other costs. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.2% for the 2017 third quarter as compared to 3.1% in the 2016 third quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.7% compared to 12.1% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs, commissions, merchandise displays and trade development. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.8% as compared to 11.7% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributor termination expenses of $15.9 million and $4.7 million for the 2017 and 2016 third quarters, respectively. General and administrative expenses excluding distributor terminations were 10.1% of net sales for the 2017 third quarter compared with 11.1% of net sales for the comparable 2016 third quarter. Payroll expenses were up $6.5 million, primarily due to head count growth internationally, including to support the launches in China and other countries and stock-based compensation and non-cash item was $1.1 million higher. Legal expenses relating to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $2.9 million in the 2017 third quarter as compared to $4.9 million in the 2016 third quarter. Our effective tax rate decreased from 33.8% in the 2016 third quarter to 31.9% in the 2017 third quarter, primarily due to profits earned by foreign subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions. Net income was $218.7 million in the 2017 third quarter compared to net income of $191.6 million in the 2016 third quarter, an increase of 14.1%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 583.3 million for the third quarter of 2016 to 578.4 million for the third quarter of 2017 as a result of share buybacks. Diluted earnings per share for the 2017 third quarter increased 15.1% to $0.38 from $0.33 in the third quarter of 2016. We estimate that distributor termination expenses in the 2017 third quarter reduced reported earnings by approximately $0.02 per share after tax. We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. We are also making good progress in the U.S. in non-traditional channels, including food service, accounts and e-commerce. In EMEA, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Georgia and Kuwait in the third quarter of 2017, and in Ghana and Morocco in October 2017. Additional launches are planned during the fourth quarter of 2017 and in the first quarter of 2018. In the third quarter of 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Nicaragua, and in October, we transitioned Monster Energy in the Bahamas, Grenada and Jamaica, the latter not to a Coca-Cola bottler. We also are planning to launch in and or transition to additional countries in the Caribbean and Central and South America in 2018. In China, during the third quarter of 2017, we launched the final two operating units and are now focusing our efforts towards establishing Monster in the country with an emphasis on key cities and accounts. We also transitioned Vietnam and have begun distribution in Taiwan. We are also planning to re-launch Monster in India. Raw material cost savings from the AFF transaction were approximately $27.7 million in the third quarter of 2017 as compared to $23.3 million in the third quarter of 2016. According to Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through October 21, 2017, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 2.6% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 6.6% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 10.3% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 1%. Sales of Red Bull increased 2.8%, sales of Rockstar increased by 0.2%, sales of 5-Hour decreased 6.4% and sales of Amp decreased 32.2%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended October 21, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased 3.6% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 7.9% over the same period last year while NOS was up 5.8% and Full Throttle sales decreased 3.6%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 5.1%, Rockstar was up 1%, 5-Hour was down 6.6% and Amp was down 39.4%. We pointed out that the energy shot category has been slowing for some time. If we exclude energy shots as well as energy coffee and energy protein drinks where we have experienced production capacity shortages, for the four weeks ended October 21, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel in dollars in fact increased by 5.8% over the same period last year with sales of Monster increasing by 11%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended October 21, 2017, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars increased by 1.5 points over the same period last year to 37.2%, NOS's share increased 0.1 points to 4.1% and Full Throttle share decreased 0.1 points to 0.9%. Red Bull share increased 0.5 points to 35%, Rockstar's share was down 0.2 points to 7.8%, 5-Hour share was lower by 0.7 points at 6.9%, and Amp's share decreased by 0.6 points to 0.9%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended October 21, 2017, sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel decreased 8.6% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 12.2% lower than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 4.8% lower. We have worked through our production capacity shortages for both Java Monster and Muscle Monster. We've secured additional production of Java Monster and Muscle Monster in the United States which came online in the third quarter of 2017. Those products came off allocation at the end of the quarter. Such production to give (10:27) additional production available to us in Europe, has eliminated our shortages for Java Monster and Muscle Monster. Together with our bottling partners, we are currently focused on regaining lost shelf space for these products. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended August 19, 2017, the energy drink category increased 2% in dollars. Monster sales increased 5% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 0.8 share points to 32.1%, Red Bull sales remained the same, and its market share decreased 1.4 points to 37.8%. Rockstar sales remained the same and its market share increased by 0.3 point to 15.9%. According to Nielsen for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 6% during the month of September 2017. Monster sales increased 34.8%. Our market share in value increased 6.1 points to 28.5% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 46.4%, Burn's market share decreased 2.4 points to 2.5%, Red Bull sales decreased 1.6% and its market share decreased by 0.8 points to 10.8%. Vive 100 market share decreased 4 points to 40.2% while Boost market share decreased 0.5 point to 8.8%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covers single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain, by one or more energy drink brands, during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen's statistics for Mexico. I'd like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers for EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI for EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ending October 8, 2017, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 14.3% to 18.5% in Great Britain, from 8.7% to 13.2% in Italy, and in France from 22.7% to 24%. According to Nielsen for the 13-week period ending October 8, 2017, Monster's retail market share in value decreased from 10.4% to 10.1% in Sweden, although the retail sales value in sales grew 25.7% in the same comparative period.

According to Nielsen for the 13-week period ending August 2017, Monster's retail market share in Ireland grew from 9.1% to 13.3%. I'd like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen for the month of September 2017 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 21.7% to 30.8%, compared to the same period last year and Monster's market share in value in Brazil for the month of September 2017, increased from 2.5% to 13.7% as compared to the same period last year. According to IRI, in Australia, Monster's market share in value grew from 6.1% to 7.4% in September 2017, as compared to the same period last year. According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the four weeks ended September 3, 2017, grew from 4% to 6.2% as compared to the same period last year.

According to INTAGE (15:11), Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 41.7% to 45.1% in September 2017, versus the same period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the third quarter of 2017 increased 16.6% from $710.1 million to $827.7 million from the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $0.4 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $76.6 million for the third quarter as compared to $72.1 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment were positively impacted by approximately $1.1 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $5.2 million in the 2017 third quarter as compared to $5.7 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $260.1 million, in the 2017 third quarter compared to $190.8 million in the corresponding quarter in 2016. Foreign exchange had the effect of increasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $0.7 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the third quarter increased 42.5% in dollars and 40.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 50.5% in the same period last year to 50.9% during the quarter. We are pleased with the rollout of certain SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In 2017, we added certain SKUs of Ultra across EMEA with the introduction of Ultra Citron, which is now available in 10 additional EMEA markets in 2017. Various SKUs in the Ultra range are now sold in 35 EMEA markets. We are also pleased that Monster continues to perform well and gain market share in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and South Africa. In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the third quarter increased 22% in dollars and 26.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 46.5% versus 46.6% over the same period last year. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 27.9% or 36.7% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. We continued to experience strong performance in Japan. In South Korea, net sales increased 16.7%, or 16.2% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales decreased 2.5% or minus 5.1% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year. As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with plans for local production in India with a view towards re-entering that market. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, gross sales in the third quarter increased 29.8% in dollars and 27.1% in local currencies. Net sales in the third quarter increased 34.3% in dollars and 31.4% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales remained the same at 47.6% during the 2017 third quarter. Net sales increased in Brazil 497.2% in dollars or 482.3% in local currency, largely due to the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took place on November 1, 2016. Net sales in Chile increased 160.8% in dollars and 159.1% in local currency. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $465.6 million compared to $377.6 million at December 31, 2016. Short-term investments were $630.3 million compared to $220.6 million at December 31, 2016. Long-term investments increased to $7 million from $2.4 million at December 31, 2016. Accounts receivable increased to $535.3 million at September 30, 2017, from $448.1 million at December 31, 2016. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 46.7 days compared to 48.2 days at December 31, 2016. Inventories increased to $213.3 million from $162 million at December 31, 2016. Average days of inventory was 56.5 days at September 30, 2017 compared to 57 days at December 31, 2016. We launched a line extension of our Mutant brand family, namely White Lightning, a zero-sugar offering to the general market in July. We remain confident about the potential of this brand. We launched Mango Loco, a new flavor in the Monster Energy juice family, exclusively with the convenience store customer in June and launched to the general market nationally in September 2017. We also launched Monster Energy Fury in September 2017 in Nigeria. We are in the process of launching Espresso Monster in two flavors as well as NOS Nitro Mango in the United States. Sales of Monster Hydro, which was launched in a 550 ml PET bottle in the United Kingdom and Ireland during the second quarter of 2017, have been encouraging. The Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink launched in the second quarter and is now available in 22 EMEA markets including South Africa. We are planning to launch the Lewis Hamilton drinks in Australia in early 2018. We remain confident about the potential for this product. We estimate October 2017 gross sales to be approximately 19.9% higher than in October 2016. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate October 2017 gross sales to be approximately 18.6% higher than in October 2016. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as for example selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affect the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. We note that in October 2017 there were 22 selling days as compared to 21 selling days in October 2016. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. On February 28, 2017, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. During the third quarter, we purchased 4.5 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $54.91 per share for a total of $248.8 million, excluding broker commissions. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. We recognized a reduction in raw material costs of $27.7 million in the third quarter as a result of our acquisition of AFF. North American and international gross margins remain healthy. The U.S. Nielsen convenience market statistics for the four weeks ended October 21, 2017 reflect that the company achieved its highest market share in the energy category in dollars at a 42.3% market share and that the Monster Energy brand achieved its highest market share in the energy category at a 37.2% market share. Equivalent market statistics for many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. The new additions to the Monster family continue to add to the company's sales. We're excited about the prospects for our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets, and reiterate the growth potential for us in China, one of the largest energy drink markets globally. We have successfully launched or transitioned Monster Energy Drinks to Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of markets this year, and anticipate further transitions and launches. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Question please?
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Hi, everyone.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi, Judy.
Hilton Hiller Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi, Judy.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So, I guess, I wanted to just start off with the gross margin question. Rodney, you called out a few factors that negatively impacted the quarter. I just wanted to get a little bit better sense of some of the callouts, specifically product mix, and then I think you said other costs. So hoping you can elaborate a little bit more? And then how much of those are really more transitory and one-time if it's something about getting the Java back online.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Well, Judy, we've always said that the international margins are lower than domestic margins. So the quarter was more pronounced because there was a larger growth in sales internationally. So that accounted for a significant portion of the reduction in overall gross margin. We had some other issues relating to input costs, some cost increases – I shouldn't say issues – cost increases in relation to input costs. And there was some impact as well of product mix where we have different products that we sell that have different – every SKU has a different margin. So on balance, this quarter there was – and with the Java coming back on stream, there was a reduction in the overall margin because of those items. So those are the three major factors that contributed to the reduction in gross margin.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Question please?
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Just to follow up on the U.S. markets. I understand the issues with Java Monster and what have you, but the overall energy drink category has kind of had the whole year low at low-single digits. Are you seeing from the competition, Red Bull in particular, just lack of innovation? Are you seeing an overall slowdown? And are you just gaining share? Or – and maybe with that, what are you seeing out of the c-store channel? We had heard earlier in the year that that had slowed down, but it seems to maybe be picking back up. So kind of any comments on kind of the state of the U.S. energy market overall, not just you gaining share and getting products back?
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: I think that as we have said on previously calls, there had been a slowing of the convenience category, which traditionally had grown at a higher rate than the other categories, and we were sort of – everybody was sort of scratching their heads a little to try and find out why. And we didn't really – weren't able to really put our finger on it. We are seeing a pickup back in the convenience category sales, and they do seem to be starting to turn around and come back, as I indicated earlier on, on the numbers. So we are positive about the category and about the convenience traffic as well. That does seem to be doing better.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivien Azer of Cowen. Question please?
Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi.
Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: So I know you guys aren't in the habit of offering guidance, but given the volatility that we've seen around Java Monster, which has historically been such a good growth driver, can you give us a sense of how we should think about distribution coming back online? Thanks.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Yes. I'm not sure we can give you very much a guidance. Obviously the energy and coffee category has continued to grow through our difficulties. We, obviously, lost sales and we lost some market share. And as we indicated at the end of the quarter, everybody is – we are back with products in inventory, we're shipping orders in full to our bottlers, and they are now – and we are together now getting product back on the shelf. So we've got to, obviously, fight back and get back the shelf space that contracted during that period, but we are – we're quite encouraged that we'll get back shelf space quite quickly. We are positive for the coffee category, and that is why we're right in the throes literally this week of starting to sell and launch Espresso Monster, and we will be coming – launching, early in the new year, we'll be launching Café Monster in glass bottles. So we think there is good growth potential for the coffee category and the coffee plus energy category. We still think those are good – it's a good growth category beverages, generally and for us. And with getting back into our inventory position and eliminating our shortages, we think that from the fourth quarter we will start to see the benefits come through. So we are positive about it. But to what extent and how quickly, obviously, we're not going to give guidance on that because it is uncertain anyway to us even at this time.
Unknown Speaker: Yeah. All we can say is that our bottler partners are committed to getting the shelf space back and committed to the product.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI. Question please.
Robert Ottenstein - Evercore Group LLC: Great. Thank you very much. I'm wondering if you can give us an update on Hydro, how it's doing in the marketplace, and whether you've gotten by the supply issues at this point, and maybe perhaps compare Hydro's reception in the market with Mutant. Thank you.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: I think they're two very different products. Let's just focus on Hydro for the moment. Hydro we've had a really good response, both to the package and to the ingredients and taste. So both of them have risen rather (31:08) well, which makes us very positive for this sort of sub-brand or subcategory. We have continued to experience production challenges and being able to get enough cans and that's been a challenge. So while we look at distribution and sales numbers, we think those numbers have been negatively affected by the fact that they don't actually relate or give the full story because we're out of stock a lot of the time. If you're out of stock, it doesn't show in the Nielsen numbers. So we believe the results have actually been more positive than are reflected in the actual sales purported to (31: 35) in the Nielsen, and that is consistent with our feedback from the market and the field and from retailers. So we are very positive about that. The way we've – addressing that is we will be launching a line of four SKUs; one – we're probably going to take one of the existing three SKUs and convert that into a 750-ml bottle, and we're going to have three other 750-ml PET bottles, one of which will be a zero calorie, zero-sugar product. So with those four products being launched early in 2018, then we will continue to maintain our sales of the cans. We are looking and are engaged in negotiations to secure additional capacity and additional production facilities to make the plastic can, the PET can, because we do believe that is a very attractive package and it is, I think important for the brand. So, ultimately, once we get that rectified, we'll obviously expand the offerings in the PET can. So going out probably early point next year, we will have PET cans and a 750-ml, a 25-ounce plastic bottle. So we believe that that will cater for the out of stocks and the erratic supply, because you'll have one or the other products in stock pretty much at all times in stores, and we are positive about Hydro as being a new category for us and a new growth area for us in 2018.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Question please.
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you, gentlemen – and ladies and gentlemen there. Just on the – if you can comment a little bit on China and what are the impressions now that you've probably reached where you wanted to be. And I know you can't compare with last year, but if you can tell us how it's tracking against plan. And if you – I think building with the last question, if you can talk a little bit about Mutant. Thank you.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: China is a great opportunity for us. It's a logistically very, very big and complex country, and we are continuing to make progress. We are learning how to market and promote our products, distribute our products in China. We had some challenges in basically securing space for us. Basically there's no real energy category. So it's not as though you can focus on the energy category and say you've got an energy product. They just put your new product in the energy category. And so there has been some struggle with the Coke bottlers where their focus and perhaps the easier way where they believe they were doing an adequate job is to – if they're struggling to find a position for the product, they find a position in the Coke cooler and your product goes into the Coke cooler. Now that seems to sound fine, but ultimately, if the other products like the Red Bull Gold, which is the leader in the category and are being sold in an independent cold door, even on the warm shelf, the consumer is not expecting to go into the Coke cooler and find an energy drink. And we're really going through a learning curve with our bottlers to try and explain to them that the first prize is not actually being in the Coke cooler. The first prize is actually being – and the essential distribution point is to be right next to Red Bull. And if you get a secondary point of distribution which is obviously always positive, then you're going to the Coke cooler with that secondary distribution point. So that is just an educational challenge to really get and communicate that to the very, very big sales force. So on the one hand, you've got this really big sales force available to us, which is a very big positive. On the other hand, they're used to selling and putting their product into the Coke door and into the Coke cooler where they have many of them. We're really having to refine that and tweak that slightly, and that's part of the challenge we have. So we remain very positive, and we believe that it's going to continue to grow. Our sales are going to continue to grow, and it is a very, very important market for us. It's just going through a learning curve and getting everything down as we continue to progress. So that is really all we can say on China is the sales are good. They're substantial. If you look at our other markets and comparable other markets that we've launched at, the sales are higher, but we are working through these operational challenges and we'll get through them. There's no doubt. It's just a question of getting them and having the time to train everybody and understand what the priorities are. So that's really an update on China.
Unknown Speaker: And I always – when I look at China, I always look at what happened in other countries where we launched, and generally we sustained losses in those countries in the earlier years. You can look at Europe and track through the various Qs and Ks, and China I don't believe will be any different. So we will sustain a loss in China this year and it's something we were prepared for and is not a shock to us.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: So we still remain ultimately at the end of the day positive that that's going to be a large contributor to the company and to the brand going forward in future years. With regard to Mutant, we're still putting our heads down. We are sort of looking at expanding our distribution and our channels. We believe that the brand has got a good potential. We are continuing to put promotional efforts behind the brand this year, and we have the bottlers' support, and we will continue to put focus on Mutant. And we see that as a long-term potential benefit and good opportunity for the company. But it is, again, if we're looking at an analysis, you look at the brands in the soft drink industry and the average age of the brands of old – decades old that we're going up against. We're doing quite well if you look at where we are in relation to the other brands, and we are going to continue to – we will continue to make progress against them as we continue to develop the brand. We're doing some testing at the moment. We're going out to test a 38 ml cap as opposed to the 26 ml, which is really – really looks good on the product. It does transform the visual image of the product and its position. And as soon as we get some input back from some key channels and key accounts we're testing this larger cap formatting, we will determine whether we actually transition all the production into the larger cap or stay with the traditional 28 ml or 26 ml cap that you normally use for soda products. So that's the one thing we are looking at in the Mutant line, and we think this is so far out from our own feeling internally is that we think that this cap will be quite a positive addition to the line going forward.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes our Q&A portion. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Monster Beverage Corporation Second Quarter 2017 Financial Results. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session with instructions following at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Now, I'll turn the conference over to your host, Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Please begin.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I'd like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends.

An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures which may be mentioned during the course of this call is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release, dated August 8, 2017. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. Sales continued to be challenging in the beverage industry in the second quarter and remained weak. In the second quarter, net sales were $907.1 million, up 9.6% from $827.5 million in the second quarter of 2016. The company achieved record second quarter gross sales of $1.04 billion, up 9.8% from $945.8 million in the second quarter of 2016. Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced net sales by approximately $8.2 million in the 2017 second quarter. The comparable 2016 second quarter net and gross sales included $5 million of accelerated deferred revenue related to distributor terminations. Excluding such accelerated recognition of deferred revenue from a comparable 2016 second quarter, net and gross sales for the 2017 second quarter increased 10.3% and 10.4%, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the second quarter was 64.3% as compared to 62.6% for the comparable 2016 second quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to cost of goods savings as a result of the AFF transaction and product mix in the U.S., which was partially offset by geographic mix and certain increases in other costs. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales was 3% for the 2017 second quarter, as compared to 3.2% in the 2016 second quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.6% compared to 11.2% in the same quarter a year-ago. The increase is primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs and commissions. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 10.1%, as compared to 13.3% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributor termination expenses of $0.2 million and $25.3 million for the 2017 and 2016 second quarters, respectively. Included in general and administrative expenses for the 2016 second quarter were AFF transaction-related expenses of $3.6 million and modified Dutch auction tender offer expenses of $1.5 million. General and administrative expenses, excluding distributor terminations, AFF transaction expenses, and stock repurchase expenses, were 10.1% of net sales for the 2017 second quarter, compared to 9.6% of net sales for the comparable 2016 second quarter, largely due to an increase in payroll costs. Payroll expenses were up $10.1 million, primarily due to head count growth internationally, including to support the launches in China and other countries as stock-based compensation, a non-cash item, was $1.3 million higher. Legal expenses relating to regulatory methods and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $2.4 million in the 2017 second quarter, as compared to $3.8 million in the 2016 second quarter. Our effective tax rate decreased slightly from 36.1% in the 2016 second quarter to 35.9% in the 2017 second quarter, primarily due to an increase in equity compensation deductions. Net income was $222.6 million in the 2017 second quarter, compared to net income of $184.2 million in the 2016 second quarter, an increase of 20.9%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 614.9 million for the second quarter of 2016 to 578 million for the second quarter of 2017 as a result of share buybacks, including the modified Dutch auction tender offer, which was completed in June 2016. Diluted earnings per share for the 2017 second quarter increased 28.6% to $0.39 from $0.30 in the second quarter of 2016. We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. Domestically, we transitioned distribution of Monster Energy Drinks to Coca-Cola bottlers in a part of North Dakota, including Florida in April 2017. So, we're also making good progress in the U.S. in non-traditional channels, including food service accounts and e-commerce. In EMEA, in the second quarter of 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Kazakhstan, Jordan and Pakistan. Additional launches are planned in the third quarter of 2017 in certain countries in Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. In the second quarter of 2017, we launched distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain countries in the Caribbean. In the second half of 2017, we anticipate launching Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain additional countries in Central and South America and in the Caribbean. In China, during the second quarter of 2017, we continued with launches in 14 new operating units. The two remaining operating units in China were launched during July 2017. We also transitioned distribution in Hong Kong and Macau to Coca-Cola bottlers. We continue to make progress towards our planned relaunch in India later this year. We are planning to commence distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Vietnam and Taiwan in the third quarter. Raw material cost savings from the AFF transaction were approximately $28.6 million in the second quarter of 2017 as compared with $1.1 million in the second quarter of 2016. Raw material cost savings from the AFF transaction were minimally realized in the comparable 2016 second quarter as the company's inventory on hand prior to the AFF transaction, as well as the inventory acquired in the AFF transaction which were recorded at fair value, were not fully recognized through cost of goods sold until the end of the second quarter of 2016. According to Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through July 22, 2017 for all outlets combined, that will be convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including energy shots increased by 0.8% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 2.2% in the 13-week period while sales of NOS increased 11.8% and sales for Full Throttle increased 1.1%. Sales of Red Bull increased 2%. Sales of Rockstar decreased by 1%. Sales of 5-Hour decreased 8.7% and sales of AMP decreased 25.8%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended July 22, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel including energy shots, in dollars increased 1.7% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 6% over the same period last year while NOS was up 9.5% and Full Throttle sales increased 1.7%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 2%. Rockstar was down 2.6%. 5-Hour was down 11.3%, and AMP was down 23.4%. We point out that the energy shot category has been slow for some time and if we exclude the energy shots, as well as the energy coffee and energy protein drinks, where we have experienced production capacity shortages, for the four-weeks ended July, 22, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channels in dollars in fact increased by 4.3% over the same period last year with sales of Monster increasing by 10%. According to Nielsen, in the four weeks ended July 22, 2017, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased by 1.5 points over the same period last year to 36.7%. NOS' share increased 0.3 points to 4% and Full Throttle's share remained the same at 0.9%. Red Bull share increased 0.1 point to 35.5%. Rockstar share was down 0.3 points to 7.6%. 5-Hour's share was lower by 1.2 points at 7.1% and AMP's share decreased 0.4 points to 1.1%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended July 22, 2017, sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel decreased 11% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 21.2% lower than in the same period last year while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 0.4% lower. We continued to experience production capacity shortages for Java Monster, which I will address later in the call. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12-weeks ended June 24, 2017, the energy drink category remained flat in dollars. Monster sales increased 11% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 3.1 share points to 31.3%. Red Bull sales decreased 1% and its market share decreased 1.3 points to 37.3%. Rockstar sales decreased 14% and its market share decreased 1.8 points to 16.8%. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 7.6% during the month of June 2017. Monster sales increased 22.6%. Our market share in value increased 3.3 points to 27.1%, against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 37.8%. Burn's market share decreased 2.1 points to 2.9%. Red Bull sales decreased 6.8% and its market share decreased by 1.7 points to 11.1%. Vive 100's market share decreased 0.7 points to 42.3%, while Boost's market share decreased 1.7 points to 8%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in their chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. I'd like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers for EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI for EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending July 2017 – the actual 13-week periods vary by a few days between different markets – Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 13.9% to 17.3% in Great Britain and from 22.3% to 23.1% in France. According to Nielsen, for the period-ending June 2017 – the actual 13-week periods vary by a few days between different markets – Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 13.9% to 14.7% in Germany, from 10.5% to 13.7% in Norway, from 24.9% to 26.5% in Spain, from 10.3% to 11.4% in Belgium, from 11.7% to 12.4% in Czech Republic, from 7.6% to 11.1% in Italy, from 7.9% to 10.3% in Ireland and from 13% to 16.2% in South Africa. According to Nielsen, in the latest 13-week period ended June 2017, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year declined from 10.7% to 9.6% in Sweden, although the retail value of sales grew 18.1% in the same comparative period, and declined from 7.4% to 5.6% in the Netherlands, which is being addressed. According to IRI, Monster has increased its market share from 27.4% to 34.5% in Greece in the 13 weeks ended June 2017. According to Nielsen, for the month of June 2017 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 21% to 29.8% compared to the same period last year, and Monster's market share in value in Brazil for the month of June 2017 increased from 2.5% to 11.5% as compared to the same period last year. According to Nielsen, in South Korea, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 18.6% to 28.9% in May 2017 compared to the same period last year. According to INTAGE, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 39.2% to 43.8% in June 2017. According to IRI, in Australia, Monster's market share in value grew from 3.4% to 7.8% in June 2017 as compared to the same period last year. And according to IRI in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the last four weeks ended June 11, 2017, grew from 4.2% to 6.7% as compared to the same period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the second quarter of 2017 increased 9.7% from $743.5 million to $815.3 million from the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the second quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $8.3 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $85.6 million for the second quarter as compared to $77.4 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment were positively impacted by approximately $0.1 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, was $6.2 million in the 2017 second quarter as compared to $6.6 million in the same quarter last year. We continued to experience production capacity shortages for our retooled products, Java Monster and Muscle Monster. To reduce the shortfall, we are manufacturing certain flavors of Java Monster in Europe which are now available to our customers in the U.S. We've also procured additional production in the U.S., which will be coming on stream in the third quarter of 2017 and will result in additional Java Monster and Muscle Monster volumes being available for distribution to retailers thereafter. As a result, we anticipate that it will still be a few months before production availability allows us to restore normal supply patterns and fully meet consumer demand that exists for these products. We estimate that net sales were negatively impacted as a result of such production capacity shortages by approximately $13 million in the second quarter and year-to-date by approximately $25 million. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $247.9 million in the 2017 second quarter compared to $200.2 million in the corresponding quarter in 2016. In local currencies, net sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately $8.2 million higher. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the second quarter increased 18.6% in dollars, and 24.8% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 50.8% in the same period last year, to 49% during the quarter. We are pleased with the rollout of certain SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In 2017, we have added certain SKUs of Ultra across EMEA, with the introduction of Ultra Citron, which will be available in 10 additional EMEA markets in 2017. Various SKUs in the Ultra range are now sold in 33 EMEA markets. We are also pleased that Monster continued to perform well and gained market share in Great Britain, Germany, France, Spain, Norway, Denmark, Poland, Ireland, Italy, Czech Republic and South Africa. In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the second quarter increased 64.6% in dollars, and 66.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 46.1% in the same period last year to 50.7% during the 2017 second quarter. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 53% or 55% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year. We continued to experience strong performance in Japan. In South Korea, net sales increased 84.7% or 78.7% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Guam, net sales decreased 3.1%, or minus 4.3% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year. As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with plans for local production in India with a view to re-entering the market in 2017. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, gross sales in the second quarter increased 28.6% in dollars and 28.8% in local currencies. Net sales in the second quarter increased 25% in dollars and 24.8% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 50% in the same period last year to 46.7% during the 2017 second quarter. Net sales increased in Brazil 849.6% in dollars, or 728.8% in local currency, largely due to the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took place on November 1, 2016. Net sales in Chile increased 35.4% in dollars and 33.4% in local currency. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $777.7 million, compared to $377.6 million at December 31, 2016. Short-term investments were $323.9 million, compared to $220.6 million at December 31, 2016. Long-term investments increased to $48.6 million from $2.4 million at December 31, 2016. Accounts receivable increased to $537.1 million at June 30, 2017, from $448.1 million at December 31, 2016. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 47 days compared to 48.2 days at December 31, 2016. Inventories increased to $190.6 million from $162 million at December 31, 2016. Average days of inventory was 53 days at June 30, 2017, compared to 57 days at December 31, 2016. We launched a line extension of our Mutant brand family, namely White Lightning, a zero-sugar offering to limited customers in the second quarter, with the general market launch in July. We remain confident about the potential of this brand. We launched our Monster Hydro energy drinks during the quarter in three flavors. Monster Hydro is a non-carbonated, lightly-sweetened energy drink that is packaged in a unique 16.9 ounce PET can, the size of which is exclusive to us in the U.S. at this time. We launched Monster Energy Ultra Violet nationally during the quarter after limited sales with a club store customer the previous quarter. We launched Mango Loco, a new flavor in the Monster Energy juice family exclusively with a convenience store customer in June and we'll launch to the general market nationally in September 2017. We also launched Monster Hydro in a 550 mL PET bottle in the United Kingdom and Ireland during the second quarter of 2017. At the end of April 2017, we launched a new Lewis Hamilton Monster Energy drink in Great Britain, which was followed by launches in 21 European markets in the second quarter of 2017 and in South Africa in July. We have a robust innovation pipeline including a new espresso Monster Energy drink in eight-ounce slim cans in two flavors and Nitrous Mango planned for launch before the year-end in the United States. We estimate 2017 July gross sales to be approximately 13.8% higher than in July 2016. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate July 2017 gross sales to be approximately 14.7% higher than in July 2016. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affect the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. We also reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. On February 28, the company's board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. No shares were repurchased under this repurchase program during the first and second quarters. In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, we recognized the reduction in raw material costs of $28.6 million in the second quarter as a result of our acquisition of AFF. Two, North American and international gross margins remain healthy. Three, while the U.S., Nielsen and market statistics show that the energy category slowed in the U.S. towards the end of the 2016 fourth quarter, it appears to have picked up steam this year, as well as in July. Equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. Currency exchange rates continued to affect our results. The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company's sales. Five, we are excited about the prospects for our company's new product launches. Six, we are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China, one of the largest energy drink markets globally. Seven, according to Nielsen, in the last 12 months ended July 1, 2017, Monster is in the top ten beverage brands in Great Britain on a value basis. Eight, we have successfully launched or transitioned Monster Energy Drinks to Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of markets in the first half of 2017 and anticipate further transitions and launches in the second half of the year. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question is from Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Your line is open.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Afternoon. Hi, Bill.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hey Bill.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Can you just talk a little bit about – we've been hearing as the transition of Coke in the U.S. goes from Coke corporate to the bottlers, there have been some benefit in terms of sales. Are you seeing that? Are you seeing any kind of change in where they go to market with your products? And is that a net benefit? I remember I guess a year ago there was – as you had the transition from ABI to Coke, it was a actually a slowdown, but I didn't know if you were seeing some net benefit as you move to market this year.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: We think that it is – there's not a general rule across the board. In certain markets, the transition has been less noticeable. In some markets, it has taken some of the newer bottlers, has taken them some time to get up to speed and we are seeing some sort of disruption in delivery schedules and et cetera. But overall, we are seeing improvements and benefits. So we are positive about the transition. It's a question of just, there is some sort of noise during the transitional periods as they've had to get up to speed. I think Hilton's got some...
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: I think the only thing I wanted to make was that anecdotally, as we looked at the independent bottlers over the years, their performance relative to the company bottlers has actually been better. So I think we're looking for better performance from these bottlers as refranchising takes place.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Yeah. I agree.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Vivien Azer of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company, LLC: Hi. Thank you. Good afternoon.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi.
Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company, LLC: And thank you for the question. So my one question just has to do with the supply constraints on coffee that you're going to remedy by exporting out of Europe. Can you please give us a sense of the potential implications to your gross margin as you work through those supply issues? Thank you.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: We had a price increase in Java Monster effective January 1. And what we have seen is that the increase in finding the price increase has actually been kind of equivalent to the increased costs that we're sustaining by bringing product from Europe. So it's basically been a wash.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Yeah. And I think that as we continue to secure increased production in the U.S., which is what we're now doing, those costs will come down. So really, it's been a temporary increase just to the extent that we have been importing, obviously, to supplement our products, yeah, we're still at all times have been getting the vast majority of our production in the U.S. And so, we obviously do have a shipping charge, but as Hilton has indicated, that's been negated by the increase, and going forward, we think that will become less relevant and we will increase those margins again.
Operator: Our next question is from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Your line is open.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi. Mark, what happened to you?
Operator: Pardon me, Mark. Your phone is on mute.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Perhaps we can come back to Mark.
Operator: We'll move to the next person. Our next person is from Amit Sharma of BMO Capital. Your line is open.
Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: At least you're there, Amit.
Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Rodney, a quick question on the trends in the CMD (32:19) channel, definite acceleration versus where we were last quarter. Can you talk about that; what's happening? In the past you've talked about innovation, maybe a reason for the category slowdown. Are we getting past that hump at this point?
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: We still haven't got a really accurate handle on the reason for the slowdown in convenience. We've all been puzzled in the beverage industry, generally. There are a number of speculative reasons that have come out over the period of time. We were talking to the Coke bottlers, and everybody's got theories. But it has been a slowdown which has been sort of unusual for us in these times. It is starting to pick up. We are seeing some positive signs, both in the CMD (33:13) category and sector and generally.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: I think one of the other things is that our convenience store customers have also been concerned about foot traffic. And while no one could put their hands on it, there's lots of speculation, as Rodney said. One of the points that was raised by the bottlers at the recent meeting that we attended was that the SNAP program and the reduction in benefits under the SNAP program could have an impact on lower convenience store traffic. So I just put that out as an additional possibility.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Yeah, I agree. And then the other one that has been, again, more anecdotal is the Trump effect just on Hispanic foot traffic into the convenience stores seems to have also dropped off a little bit.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Hi, everyone.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi, Judy.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Rodney, I had one clarification on Java and then a Hydro question. So on Java, when you said getting to the normal supply is going to take a few months. Are you commenting that maybe in third quarter we still see a drag of something like a $10 million to $15 million that we saw in the first and the second quarter, or basically that drag dissipates as you're kind of lapping the decline that you started to see last year? And then on Hydro, can you just update us on maybe what you're seeing from a distribution ramp perspective? Because if you look at the ACV, I think it's still below 40%, even though it's come up pretty nicely, and that's still below the number that you're seeing for the Green and the Ultra. Do you think that you can get to that level pretty quickly from a Hydro perspective?
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Just going back to the coffee question. We think that there still will be a drag from July, but we're seeing every month, we are seeing improved deliveries, and we think that we will be fully up to speed towards the end of the quarter. So we think that there will be – still be some drag, some reduction, shortages going forward, but we think it will be reduced, but to the extent we're not sure. And obviously, we're right in the phase now of getting production, and that means getting back our shelf space and that will take a bit of time. With regard to Hydro, your point is noted, and that is correct that the ACV at the moment is at about 40%. So we've obviously still got some work to do to get Hydro out and get it – again, it was sort of launched a little bit off cycle. And so we are getting it into the chains and into the stores, but it is taking some time. But again, there are all sort of supplier constrictions on the number of packages we're able to put out. This obviously is of concern to us, but unfortunately, we do believe in the package. We feel that the package is important for the product to create the right image and the right personality around the brand and the product. So we are continuing to address the supply issues, and literally, we're selling all we can supply. So we will continue to, I think, improve the supply situation and as that goes, so we will continue to supply – to increase and improve our distribution. But that's really a positive side of the brand, that it is pulling and it has received good consumer response. We are looking at addressing the brand with an additional package, which won't have the same supply constraints, a slightly larger-sized bottle. And we believe we'll be able to launch that and get that on the shelves at the same time as the can. And that will supplement we believe the can and consumer demand. The consumer will have a choice, but we do not want to replace the can with a similar-sized bottle. This will be a larger bottle where at the moment we haven't finalized the exact size, but it's probably likely to be about a 750 mL size, resealable. So we're looking to have both products. We're also looking to have different flavors in the bottle. So there will be a choice of additional flavors and hopefully we'll be able to get to that and solidify our shelf space and therefore satisfy consumers and retailers so that there will always be a supply of Hydro on the shelves, even though there may at times be some shortages in the can size, until we get those supply issues rectified.
Operator: Thank you. Now we have a question from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Your line is open.
Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Let's try that again. Can you hear me?
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Yes, this time we can.
Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Perfect. Hilton muted my line. That was the problem.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Yeah. We thought we got off lightly this quarter.
Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So I was curious if you could comment on the number of SKUs you're selling in international markets, just sort of broadly. I mean I know there are more in EMEA versus some other markets. But you see, call it 10, 15 SKUs in a typical shelf placement in the U.S. Where are you in other international markets? And sort of how do you think about that as an opportunity longer term? And how do you ultimately get incremental shelf space?
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Well, if you look at mass markets, it really is very varied. It depends on the maturity of the market. As you say, you've got most of the European markets with a lot more SKUs, but even within the European markets there is a tremendous disparity between what you've got on shelves in the UK and Germany and Spain versus other markets. And it varies pretty dramatically. You also have a lot of the, what I call the sub lines, the strategic lines that we've got, the families that haven't yet even been launched. We've launched Ultra, but you really have no coffee and you have very little Rehab in Europe. And we've just sort of going up with Punch and repositioning the juice line. But again, we've launched Hydro pretty much in the United Kingdom and Ireland, but we are looking to launch Hydro quite quickly not everywhere but in a number of selected markets in Europe, including South Africa. We think there is a good potential for the brand. So out of that you go to South America and Asia, the SKUs are much, much more limited. And so we've got just a lot of potential. Even if you go down to places like Chile where we're doing a lot of business there, there still is a pretty much a handful or so of SKUs. So there is a lot of potential. But if you looked at it sort of on average, I would say you're looking at probably 30% to 40% of the SKUs on average in overseas markets versus the U.S., just as a very, very broad thumb suck (40:55) across a number of – but that's not on a weighted or on any sort of statistical analysis. That's just pretty much anecdotally our gut feel.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: First question is on the U.S. market. So strong July growth sales update, 14.7%, FX neutral. Doesn't look like there's any adjustment needed for trading days, so that's great. Hilton, do you have the breakdown between U.S. and international? I guess as we're looking at the Nielsen data, the most recent data that we got for the last couple of weeks in July was up 8%, and you had spoken to some of the acceleration you're seeing. Is that sort of representative of the acceleration you're seeing? That's question number one. And then, Rodney, for you, question number two. With respect to Java and Muscle Monster, as that supply comes back on, how are you ensuring that's all incremental? You called out the $13 million and $25 million year-to-date drag for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively, if I'm not mistaken, so that's a couple points to U.S. sales growth. So any comments there with respect to how incremental that could potentially be for the U.S. would be helpful. Thank you for both of those.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Okay. So as we look at our increase in July, and we always give a lot of caveats because it's very early in the month, that 14.7% that we spoke about that was internationally, that wasn't in the U.S. So I'm not sure, your reference to that being in the U.S., that's a group consolidated number. Also, we don't traditionally break down our increase in gross sales by market area, and I don't think we want to start that because I don't think we've done that in the past. So I'm not going to give that number, but the 14.7% is a consolidated number. As we said, it's 13.8% and 14.7% on a foreign exchange adjusted basis.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: All we can really say is that if you look at the Nielsen numbers, as you said, you are seeing that increase. We're seeing it as well. So we seem to be ahead of the Nielsen, generally, continuing to get share both internationally and in the U.S. So there's nothing that's inconsistent with our previous growth in the quarter that we're seeing in the month of July. It just is doing better generally across the board. With regard to Java and Muscle Monster, where we sat incremental, I mean, we've lost shelf space, but even if you look at Java, I was looking at the numbers on all major channels. Even for our two main Java products which we've basically been in stock most of the time this year, our distribution is down at about 71%, whereas in our other top brands we're in the high 80%s and low 90%s. So they've clearly lost some distribution even for the two main SKUs. The others, if we look at salted caramel, which we introduced quite a bit of time ago, that's at 40%. So we've got a lot of opportunity. We've just got to get supplies back and that is one of the reasons that we hesitated a bit earlier. Because it's one thing getting back supplies in line, it's another thing making sure that we have those supplies on a consistent basis before we go back out and reestablish shelf space and get back shelf space because we obviously don't want another hiccup with retailers. So we really do have quite a bit of upside potential in just improving our supply channels, having products on shelf, getting back our listings for not only the line extensions, (44:50) and salted caramel and Irish, but even just getting back our distribution levels and consistency with Mean Bean and Loca Moca. So we look at that as being, positive and it is going to start basically taking place during this quarter. But it's going to be on an increased rolling basis and we think that by the fourth quarter, we will very much be back into where we were and we look at the coffee category growing pretty well. And that's been slowed down, I think even with the issues we've had and with our competitors. But we think that's going to continue to grow and move back into growth. With regard to Muscle Monster, it's the same issue, which is supply. We are also looking and evaluating and going to relaunch and reposition the Muscle Monster in an aseptic plastic bottle, which will be a resealable bottle. So Muscle Monster is going move into a plastic bottle, we think hopefully still later this year. We've done some testing with the bottle and the labeling and hopefully that's going to be a position to start in the next few months. And so that transition we think will be a positive transition for Muscle Monster to also get it back and give it a kickstart again because we are positive about that sector, which we think we are under-represented in at the moment. So that's another source of, we think, some potential upside.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: Yeah, just to be clear, we utilized the production capacity that was available to us with Java Monster for our top-selling SKUs. So we decided we were not going to bring those SKUs from Europe because we didn't want to disturb the flavor profile. We wanted to maintain the flavor profile. So those two products, the main two products in the Java Monster line, we kept with production here.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this ends the Q&A portion of today's conference. I'd like to turn the call over to Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. And in particular to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally. We're also particularly excited by the new opportunities that we have going forward with the portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world comprised of our Monster Energy Brand, together with the strategic brands, as well as Mutant. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, he's with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance.

An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated May 4, 2017. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. Sales continue to be challenging in the beverage industry in the first quarter and remain weak. In the first quarter, net sales were $742.1 million, up 9.1% from $680.2 million in the first quarter of 2016. The company achieved record first quarter gross sales of $845.5 million, up 8.8% from $777.5 million in the first quarter of 2016. Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced net sales by approximately $3.7 million in the 2017 first quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the first quarter was 64.8%, as compared to 62.2% for the comparable 2016 first quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to cost of goods savings, as a result of the AFF transaction, which was partially offset by product mix and certain increases in other costs. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.1% for the 2017 first quarter, as compared to 3.4% in the 2016 first quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.7%, compared to 10.2% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs and commissions. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 14.4%, as compared to 11.1% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative costs, excluding distributor termination expenses, as a percentage of net sales increased to 11.8% in the first quarter of 2017, compared to 10.6% for the 2016 first quarter. Payroll expenses were up $13 million, primarily to support the strategic brand that we acquired from Coca-Cola, as well as the launches in China and other countries internationally, and stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $3.1 million higher. Distributor termination expenses were $19.9 million in the first quarter as compared to $3.4 million in the 2016 first quarter. Legal expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's product were $1.9 million in the 2017 first quarter as compared to $5.4 million in the 2016 first quarter. Our effective tax rate decreased from 35.8% in the 2016 first quarter to 32.8% in the 2017 first quarter primarily due to an increase in profits earned by certain foreign subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions than the U.S., as well as an increase in equity compensation deductions. Net income was $178 million in the 2017 first quarter, compared to net income of $163.9 million in the 2016 first quarter, an increase of 8.6%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 620.7 million for the first quarter of 2016 to 582 million for the first quarter of 2017, as a result of share buybacks, including the modified Dutch tender auction, which was completed in June 2016. Net income was impacted by the substantial increase in distributor termination expenses previously mentioned above. Diluted earnings per share for the 2017 first quarter increased 15.8% to $0.31 per share from $0.26 in the first quarter of 2016. We estimate that distributor termination expenses in the 2017 first quarter of $19.9 million negatively affected diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.02 per share after tax. We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. Domestically, we transitioned distribution of Monster Energy Drinks in Wisconsin to Coca-Cola bottlers in early January 2017, in parts of Minnesota including Minneapolis and St. Paul in March 2017, and in a part of North Dakota including Fargo in April 2017. We are also making good progress in the U.S. in non-traditional channels, including food service accounts. In EMEA in the first quarter of 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Nigeria, Oman and smaller countries in EMEA. And in April 2017 we commenced distribution of Monster with the Coca-Cola bottler in Kazakhstan. Further additional launches are planned in the remainder of the second quarter of 2017 in certain countries in Africa and the Middle East. In the first quarter of 2017 we launched distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain countries in the Caribbean. In the second quarter of 2017 we anticipate launching Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain other smaller and medium-sized markets in that geographic region. In China during the first quarter of 2017, we continued with launches in Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Zhejiang and Jiangsu. We also extended distribution in the Guangdong province. Further launches are planned in China and in other countries, including a relaunch in India in 2017. We also commenced distribution in Malaysia in the same period. We continue to make progress towards our planned relaunch in India later this year. We are also on track to commence distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Vietnam, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan in the second quarter. As a result of the AFF transaction, we achieved raw material cost savings of $23.3 million in the 2017 first quarter, which were broadly in line with expectations. According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through April 22, 2017, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including energy shots increased by 2.5% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 1.8% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 10.6%, and sales of Full Throttle decreased 5.1%. Sales of Red Bull increased 5.3%, sales of Rockstar increased by 1.9%, sales of 5-hour decreased 6.4%, and sales of AMP decreased 29.9%. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars increased 2.7% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 1.5% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 12.7%, and Full Throttle sales decreased 2.1%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 5.8%, Rockstar was up 4.6%, 5-hour was down 7.2%, and AMP was down 29.9%. We pointed out that the energy shot category has been slowing for some time. And if we exclude the energy shots, as well as energy coffee and energy protein drinks, where we have experienced production capacity shortages, for the 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel in dollars, in fact, increased by 4.6% over the same period last year, with sales of Monster increasing by 4.5%. We note that the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks and 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, exclude sales of NOS and Full Throttle 8 packs, which were not yet in the Nielsen system. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, decreased by 0.4 points over the same period last year to 35%. NOS's share increased 0.4 points to 4.2%, and Full Throttle's share remained the same at 1%. Red Bull's share increased 1 point to 36%, Rockstar's share was up 0.1 of a point to 8%, 5-hour's share was lower by 0.8 of a point at 7.4%, and AMP's share decreased 0.6 of a point to 1.2%. According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel decreased 6.3% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 19.5% lower than the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 8.6% higher. We continue to experience production capacity shortages for Java Monster, which I will address later in the call. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12-weeks ended April 1, 2017, the energy drink category increased 2% in dollars. Monster sales increased 10% versus a year ago, and market share increased 2.1 share points to 30.5%. Red Bull sales increased 3%, and its market share decreased 0.4 of a point to 35.9%. Rockstar's sales increased 5%, and its market share increased 0.8 points to 19.4%. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 27% during the month of March 2017. Monster sales increased 41.1%, and market share in value increased 2.7 points to 26.7% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 27%. Burn's market share decreased 2.7 points to 3.7%. Red Bull's sales decreased 3.5%, and its market share decreased by 3.7 points to 11.6%. Vive 100's market share increased 4.5 points to 41.9%, while Boost's market share decreased 2.1 points to 7.9%. The transition to the KO bottler system in August 2016 resulted in significantly-wider availability of Monster in the traditional trade channel, mom-and-pop stores in Mexico. According to Nielsen, distribution of Monster grew from 10% in March 2016 to 24% in March 2017 in this channel. This translates to growth in Monster's value share of 9 percentage points versus March 2016 in the traditional channel. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in their chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers for EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI for EMEA vary from country-to-country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending March 2017, the actual 13-week periods differ, varied by few days between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 13% to 15.5% in Great Britain, from 9.5% to 10.6% in Belgium, from 9.1% to 11.6% in Norway, from 21.5% to 23.7% in France, from 24.4% to 26.5% in Spain, and from 13% to 16.3% in Germany. According to Nielsen, for the period ending March 2017, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year decline from 6.8% to 5.2% in the Netherlands and from 11.1% to 10.8% in Sweden, although the retail value of sales grew 22.1% in Sweden in the comparable period. For the 13-week period, ending March 2017, according to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share and value as compared to the same period last year grew from 11.3% to 11.6% in the Czech Republic, from 15.8% to 17.7% in South Africa and from 6.9% to 9.7% in Italy. For the 13-week period, ending February 2017, according to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share and value as compared to the same period last year grew from 7.3% to 9.9% in Ireland. According to IRI, Monster's market share in Greece grew in the 13 weeks ended February 2017 from 27.7% last year to 29.1%. According to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share and value in Chile increased to 28.4% in March 2017 as compared to 20.5% last year, and after transitioning to the KO bottler system in November 2016, Monster's market share and value in Brazil grew to 7.4% in March 2017 as compared to 2.9% in the same period last year. According to Nielsen, in South Korea, Monster's retail market share and value increased from 17.9% to 24.5% in February 2017 compared to the same period last year. According to INTAGE, Monster's market share and value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 39.9% to 44.2% in March 2017. According to IRI, in Australia, Monster's market share and value grew from 3.1% to 7.1% in March 2017, and in New Zealand, Monster's market share and value grew from 2.3% to 5.5% for the first quarter of 2017 versus the same period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the first quarter of 2017 increased 7.5% from $621.7 million to $668.6 million from the comparable period last year. Gross sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the first quarter of 2017 increased 7.4% from $713.5 million to $766.6 million for the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the first quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $4.7 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $68 million for the first quarter as compared to $58.5 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment were positively impacted by approximately $1 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $5.5 million in the 2017 first quarter. There were no sales for the Other segment in the comparable 2016 first quarter. We continue to experience production capacity shortages for our re-torqued (18:03) products, Java Monster and Muscle Monster. To reduce the shortfall, we have commenced manufacturing certain flavors of Java Monster in Europe which will shortly be available to our customers in the U.S. We've also procured additional production in the U.S. which will be coming on stream early in the third quarter of 2017 and will result in additional Java Monster and Muscle Monster volumes being available for distribution to retailers thereafter. As a result, we anticipate that it will still be a number of months before production availability allows us to restore normal supply patterns and fully meet consumer demand that exists for these products. We estimate that net sales in the quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $12 million as a result of such production capacity shortages. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $190.9 million for the 2017 first quarter compared to $149.1 million in the corresponding quarter in 2016. In local currencies, net sales to customers outside of the U.S. were approximately $3.7 million higher. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the first quarter increased 17.7% in dollars, and 21.7% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 50.2% in the same period last year to 50.3% during the quarter. We are pleased with the rollout of certain SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In 2017, we added additional SKUs of Ultra across EMEA with the introduction of Ultra Citron, which will be available in 10 additional EMEA markets in 2017. Various SKUs in the Ultra range are now sold in 33 EMEA markets. We're also pleased that Monster continued to perform well and gained market share in Great Britain, Germany, France, Spain, Norway, Denmark, Poland, Ireland, Italy and the Czech Republic. In Asia Pacific, net sales in the first quarter increased 58.1% in dollars, and 60.5% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 45.2% in the same period last year to 47.7% during the 2017 first quarter. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 18.8% or 22.3% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year. We continue to experience strong performance in Japan. In South Korea, net sales increased 15% or 18.2% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Guam, net sales increased 44.7%, or 50% in local currencies, as compared to the same quarter last year. As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with plans for local production in India with a view towards reentering the market in 2017. In Latin America, including Mexico, the Caribbean, gross sales in the first quarter increased 36.2% in dollars and 34.9% in local currencies. Net sales in the first quarter increased 42.2% in dollars and 41.8% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 41.1% in the same period last year to 48.8% during the 2017 first quarter. Net sales increased in Brazil 396.4% in dollars, or 481.7% in local currency, largely due to the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took place on November 1, 2016. Net sales in Chile increased 47.6% in dollars, and 59.1% in local currency. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $576.3 million, compared to $377.6 million at December 31, 2016. Short-term investments were $209.4 million, compared to $220.6 million at December 31, 2016. Long-term investments decreased to $0.5 million from $2.4 million at December 31, 2016. Accounts receivable increased to $509.5 million at March 31, 2017, from $448.1 million at December 31, 2016. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 54.9 days, compared to 48.2 days at December 31, 2016. Inventories increased to $171.3 million from $162 million at December 31, 2016. Average days of inventory was 59 days at March 31, 2017, compared to 57 days at December 31, 2016. As previously reported, in September 2016 we launched Mutant, an exciting super soda in limited convenience stores in certain U.S. markets with encouraging sales per point of distribution. We will be launching a line extension of our Mutant brand family, namely White Lightning, a zero-sugar offering to limited customers initially, followed with a general market launch in July. We remain confident about the potential of this brand. In preparation for the launch of Hydro, we commenced limited deliveries of Hydro products to our bottlers and full service distributors at the end of the quarter and are planning for the launch of Hydro to the general retail trade at the end of this month. Hydro is a non-carbonated, lightly-sweetened energy drink that is packaged in a unique 16.9 oz PET can, the size of which is exclusive to us in the U.S. at this time. We are planning to launch Hydro in a 550 ml PET bottle in the United Kingdom and Ireland during the second quarter of 2017. We expanded distribution of Monster Energy Ultra Violet and launched Full Throttle Orange during the first quarter of 2017. At the end of April 2017 we launched a new Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink in Great Britain, which will be followed by launches in 24 European markets in the second quarter of 2017 and in South Africa in July. We have a robust innovation pipeline and further launches, such as Mango Loco, a new flavor in our Monster Energy juice family, which is planned for a third quarter 2017 launch, and a new espresso Monster Energy drink in 8 oz slim cans in two flavors planned for launch before year end. April 2017 had one fewer selling day compared with April 2016. We estimate April 2017 gross sales to be approximately 9.5% higher than in April 2016. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate April 2017 gross sales to be approximately 10.6% higher than in April 2016. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches, and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances, where our bottlers are responsible for production, and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. On February 28, 2017, the company's board of directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. No shares were repurchased under this repurchase program during the first quarter. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. We recognize the reduction in raw material costs of $23.3 million in the first quarter as a result of our acquisition of AFF. North American and international gross margins remain healthy. While the U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that the Energy Drink category slowed in the U.S. towards the end of the 2016 fourth quarter, it appears to have picked up steam through the first quarter. The equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the Energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. Currency exchange rates continue to affect our results. The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company sales. We're excited about the prospects for our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China, one of the largest energy drink markets globally. We have successfully transitioned additional international countries to Coca-Cola bottlers in the first quarter and will be transitioning a number of other markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in 2017. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good afternoon, guys.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi, good afternoon, Dara.
Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Rodney, can you give us more detailed thoughts on your trends so far in the cities and where you've launched in China early on. And you've been, for a few months, any update on consumer demand in those markets? And then also, separately, some of the new cities launched more recently and what level is retailer reception you're getting? Thanks.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: I think that it really is still very early to tell. We're getting sales that we are comfortable with. It's all right, but they vary from area to area depending on the execution of the bottler, depending on the positioning in the stores and basically, pricing and points of sale. So, we think that it's certainly going to take time to continue. You can't just put stuff – a brand like Monster which is not known on the shelf and expect it to immediately start achieving velocities that are where you'd like it to be. There is a buildup and we're going to go through this buildup over a period of time. So really, it really is premature. We're comfortable with the velocities we're getting and the volumes. We're comfortable with the attention and focus. We're putting a lot of effort behind it. We're building up our own infrastructure and teammates to support the brand, support sampling and in-store execution, and we are seeing good execution from a point of view of our point of sale and things of that nature. And we are quite happy with that. But it really is just premature to talk. We are comfortable with the market. It is a large market, and it will continue. We're right in the middle of the rollouts, as we've indicated. There were a whole new number of regions we introduced. It's probably late because of the Chinese New Year was late February into March. We're planning launches. We've planned launches, and we have launched throughout April. And we continue in May, and then pretty much most of it will be done. So there will be a few more areas to do in June and July, but we think it'll be pretty much done by then. There may be one or two hiccups that we don't anticipate at this point. But it will take time, and it's just a very big market and you've got to be patient with and just build slowly.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: I think one of the other points about China is that a number of the websites and social media that our consumers are used to elsewhere in the world don't appear in China. So in a sense while we have extremely good exposure for the brand in many, many markets in the world, we don't have that same exposure to the Internet in China. So the build will be a lot harder.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good afternoon, everybody.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi.
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. I just wanted to follow up with more like thinking of all the outlets, if you can think about like how your growth was? I mean if you're putting the $12 million back, most likely your sales grew close to 7%? I wanted to just clarify that in the U.S. And if that is a number that we should use? And how is the cadence of the improvement during the quarter? I'm assuming, as most companies, like things have improved for the cadence of the quarter? And if you can tell us roughly how the sellout has been?
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Well, let's just deal with the first question. One at a time.
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. All right.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: You've got to do your own numbers. We don't report the numbers for the U.S. and break them out. You've seen the Nielsen numbers. If you take the Nielsen numbers and then factor in the negative effect on the production issues we've had and they've really been sort of more identified by – we try to keep the two main SKUs in production and on the shelf. But really what it's done is that most of the other SKUs have been out of production and off-the-shelf, and that has continued. So you've got to really take that into account in looking at the growth of the industry and the growth of Monster in the U.S. We did sort of have probably less innovation hitting in this period than we had last year, sort of the reserve for Red Bull. But again, we've explained on a number of occasions what our innovation is for this year and how it's going to come in later in the year because of timing. So we really think that you guys have got make your own judgment call on how you look at the U.S. and the growth. We don't give guidance on the growth either to U.S. or on a broader basis, but we feel pretty comfortable about the industry. We are seeing growth if you look at the Nielsen numbers, and that's what I was referred to earlier. It was down to almost a negative inconvenience in December, and then it's grown just under 1% in January. It was 1.5% or so, roughly, in February. It was 2.5% or 2.6% in March, and it's actually gone up a little higher in April. So clearly there is a nice trend, but you can see the numbers as well as we can. And we think that that is positive going forward.
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: But do you see it tracks well at this point? Nielsen is tracking well your actual volumes?
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: I'm not sure I heard the question.
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: No. I'm just saying if...
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: There's a difference between our sales and – the increase in our sales and what we are seeing in Nielsen. So we went through the Nielsen numbers on the call. You saw what our quarterly sales levels were, and then you must make your own assumptions as to what you think the performance was.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: We obviously sell in a lot of the non-major channels and that really accounts for the difference and if you've noticed over the years there always has been some timing differences between Nielsen and our numbers.
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Thanks
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is open.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Hey. Good afternoon, guys.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi, Mark.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So maybe just to go back to that last question, something that clearly comes up repeatedly in conversations from investors in terms of trying to reconcile the scanner data with your reported results, maybe if you could give us a bit of specifics about change in points of distribution in the untracked channels, just so sort of where they come from, where are they now, and how large as a percent of the business – if you don't want to say specifically, but just sort of broader strokes about how important they're becoming to the business today versus where they've been. I think that might help folks a bit.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Without going into the level of them, we are starting to do more business and have more sales in the non-major channels, for example, food service, specialty accounts, non-food accounts. And those continue to increase. Internet, Amazon, although small, some of them are small, they are increasing at quite a strong rate. And we think that one of the reasons there is possibly some slowdown in the convenience channel is it may be attributable to the broader availability, not only of Monster but in fact of energy drinks, through a number of these non-traditional channels.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp.: So, Mark, maybe I can give you a little bit more color. In the on-premise segment, we continue to see double-digit growth in this channel. So maybe that'll be helpful.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Sharma with BMO. Your line is open.
Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi. Good afternoon.
Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Rodney, two questions. One on China. You talked about the buildup as we go through the next few months, or three months, and expect to be fully done by, latest, summer. When you say that, are you thinking about the ACV build or just the penetration? How are we thinking about it when we say fully implemented there? And then international again...
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Well, let's just start – let's just do it one at a time, guys, please.
Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Okay. When we say July, we will have launched through all of the business units in the – on the two Coke bottlers, there were three Coke bottlers and, as you are aware, the Coca-Cola owned bottler, they've sold their and refranchised their system. It's been divided effectively between COFCO and Swire. And then there was some interchange of territories between COFCO and Swire so that their own territories are more aligned and more adjacent to each other. So we will have launched by July through the different BUs. There is obviously no instantaneous miraculous listing on all the shelves. We're going to continue to build, because particularly in China, there is a modern trade, which is easier and obviously you pick up listings on that much more quickly. But the very, very bulk – large bulk of the business is still traditional trade. And that means it's got to be built up store-by-store slowly, slowly, one-by-one. So that is going to still take time to get that penetration up. And that is going to be a slow build. As we continue to build, as we continue to gain momentum, as we hopefully increase our velocity, we'll also be increasing our exposure and distribution through the whole system. So that's still going to take some time. There is a distinction between those two.
Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it. That's really helpful. And then I just had a question on the international contribution margins, right? And you talked about gross margins increasing in many markets. How should we think about it? You're getting more and more contribution from international markets. At the operating level also are you seeing margins improve from these markets?
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: We are seeing some benefit. We are seeing benefits of scale and also improving our local production. We're continuing to get a number of additional plants online, which is helping us reduce our costs in many markets. And that will continue, because as we continue to build out the international market, we are continuing to go through this process of getting production lower and nearer to these markets. We do have – we'll have that same build in marketing and at G&A spend. But initially in some of the newer markets, we obviously are overspending in our G&A side, particularly payroll, in order to support the launches of brands. And so that will take some time, but as we continue, it will have less and less impact as we get maturer in these markets. But we still do have some large markets. I mean, going through the market in China at the moment, we're continuing to increase our head count quite substantially as we're go into each of these launches in each of these Bus, we have to have representation. When we go into India, we will need more people. So there is a disconnect but it is becoming less impactful, because of that we're seeing we think some better gross margins and better bottom-line margins as we go forward.
Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, guys.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi.
Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: I'd like to understand, I mean, to have a bit more clarification on two buckets of growth for you. So first is international launches. Could you give us an update on the three of the major country launches this year? So India, Pakistan, and Argentina. I understand Nigeria has been down. And the second bucket, of course, is Mutant in the U.S. So would like to understand, I mean, what are the marketing activities you are planning to implement to support same-store sales growth, that seems to be soft for now So if you can give me, I mean, or give us, I mean, a bit on those two things and two buckets of growth that would be great. Thank you.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Yes. Just looking at those three markets, they're very large markets, but they're smaller markets from a point of view of the energy category, the premium energy category. So, in India, we are – as we've indicated planning to launch. We're also evaluating the possibility of launching Mutant as a sort of an affordable energy drink in that market. Argentina, we are moving forward. We are very close. We've still not finalized packing arrangements, but we're right in the middle of negotiations on that, and hope to be able to finalize that reasonably soon. We are, at the same time, going down the track of actually having our product registered and approved, so that's all happening, so that is again will also be a later launch later this year. With regard to Pakistan, we just – pretty much, I think we're about or we're in the throes of just starting to sell now, but it's a smaller market from a premium energy drink product brand. We think there is a much larger market that we can look at, and again, we're also looking at the possibility of launching Mutant there, also still later this year. So they're sort of slightly different. They're slightly different markets, and we are in the planning stages with them, and in the process, so they're all hopefully going to come through before the end of the year.
Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. And on Mutant in the U.S., give us some color on to the marketing activities you are planning to implement to support same-store sales growth that would be great. Thank you.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: Well, we have some planning activities. We have switched certain of our existing Monster properties, which we've had for many years and have done – worked very nicely for Monster, such as the Vans Warped Tour. We've made the Vans Warped Tour pretty much a Mutant property, which will get us a lot of sampling, a lot of exposure in 40-something markets and concerts around the U.S. We've also switched, not completely, but a lot of exposure of Mutant into the Monster Jam Series, which are those big trucks, and that's going to happen for the rest of the year. We are going to do in-store price promotions. We're doing sampling, extensive sampling promotions as well for Mutant, and that's all starting to kick in now starting in May and June, the promotions and, as I've said, the sampling activities. We also indicated that we had started with certain limited retailers. We're actually starting some distribution of basically our new zero-calorie White Lightning Mutant drink, which will then give us a better positioning on shelf, and give us alternative offerings, full calorie, and sugar and zero, and that will be probably in the general market by beginning of July. So those two things together we believe with a much broader rollout now. We've opened the market. The number of accounts we're going to in the channels. We are expanding that at the same time now and getting listings. So again, by the time we get to summer midyear, we think that we will have much better distribution for Mutant.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO for closing remarks.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.: On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company, both at home and abroad, and in particular to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally. We're also particularly excited about the new opportunities that we have going forward with a portfolio of energy products throughout the world comprised of our Monster Energy brand, together with the strategic brands, as well as Mutant. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you all may disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2016 Q4  (2017-03-01 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Rodney Sacks - Chairman & CEO Hilton Schlosberg - Vice Chairman & President Tom Kelly - SVP, Finance
Analysts: Bill Chappell - SunTrust Mark Astrachan - Stifel Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets Kevin Grundy - Jefferies Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Monster Beverage Corporation's Fourth Quarter and Year End 2016 Financial Results Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Rodney Sacks: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I'd like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance, and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the Company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed today including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and forward-looking statements, for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated March 1, 2017. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. On October 14, 2016, we announced a three-for-one stock split of the company's common stock to be effective in the form of a 200% stock dividend. The common stock dividend was issued on November 9, 2016, and the company's common stock began trading at the split adjusted price on November 10, 2016. Accordingly all per share amounts; common stock outstanding, and common stock repurchase, presented on this call have been adjusted retroactively where applicable to reflect the stock split. Sales in the beverage industry in the fourth quarter continued to be soft globally. In the fourth quarter, net sales was $753.8 million, up 16.8% from $645.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The company achieved record gross sales of $848.8 million, up 14.2% from $743.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The comparative net and gross sales of $645.4 million and $743.2 million respectively for the 2015 fourth quarter were impacted by advanced purchases made by the companies customers due to a pre-announced price increase, effective August 31, 2015, on certain of the company's Monster Energy brand energy drinks. The company estimates that both net and gross sales for the 2015 fourth quarter were reduced by approximately $11 million and $12 million respectively, as a result of such advanced purchases. Net and gross sales for the 2016 fourth quarter after adjusting the 2015 fourth quarter comparatives for advanced purchase increased by 14.8% and 12.4% respectively. Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced net sales by approximately $3.3 million and gross sales by approximately $5.9 million in the 2016 fourth quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the fourth quarter was 66.1% as compared to 62.5% for the comparable 2015 fourth quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to cost of goods savings as a result of the AFF transaction and product mix as well as reduced promotional allowances as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter. We estimate the lower promotional allowances as a percentage of sales as compared to prior periods, together with the reduction of Java Monster sales had the effect of increasing gross profit percentage by approximately 2% in the fourth quarter. Distribution cost as a percentage of net sales were 3.2% compared to 2016 and 2015 fourth quarters. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12% compared to 12.9% in the same quarter a year ago, they increased in absolute dollars. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs and premiums. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 17.5% as compared to 11% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative costs excluding distributed termination expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 11.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 10.5% for the 2015 fourth quarter. Payroll expenses were up $12.3 million primarily to support the strategic brands that we acquired from Coca-Cola and stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash item, was $3.1 million higher. Distributor termination expenses were $46.3 million in the fourth quarter as compared to $3.3 million in the 2015 fourth quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, commercial ingredients, used safety and sale of the company's products were $5.1 million in the 2016 fourth quarter as compared to $6 million in the 2015 fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate in the quarter decreased from 39.5% in the 2015 fourth quarter to 29.9% in the 2016 fourth quarter primarily due to an increase in the domestic production deduction as well as an increase in the stock compensation deduction as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance effective January 1, 2016, under which excess tax benefits are recorded in net income. Net income was $172.9 million in the 2016 fourth quarter compared to net income of $138.7 million in the 2015 fourth quarter, an increase of 24.7%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 617.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 to 580.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, as a result of share buybacks, including the modified Dutch tender auction, which was completed in June 2016. Net income was impacted by the substantial increase in distributor termination expenses previously mentioned above. Diluted earnings per share for the 2016 fourth quarter increased to 32.6% to $0.30 from $0.22 in the fourth quarter of 2015. We estimate that distributor terminations expenses in the 2016 fourth quarter of $46.3 million negatively affected diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.05 per share after tax. Distributor termination expense for the 2015 fourth quarter had no effect on diluted earnings per share after tax. We refer you to the press release for the specific factors affecting profitability for the 2016 and 2015 fourth quarters respectively. Turning to the full-year results. The company achieved record gross sales of $3.5 billion for the full-year, up 12.2% from $3.1 billion in 2015. Net sales were up 12% from $2.7 billion to $3 billion. Gross and net sales for the year were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, totaling $31 million and $22.3 million respectively for the year. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 63.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 60% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating income was up 21.4% to $1.1 billion from $893.7 million in 2015. Our effective tax rate decreased to 34% in 2016 from 38.7% in 2015. Net income was $712.7 million, up 30.4% over net income of $546.7 million in 2015, and diluted earnings per share increased 25.6% to $1.19 from $0.95 in 2015. We refer you to the press release for the specific factors impacting profitability for the 2016 and 2015 financial years respectively. We have made good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers globally. Domestically we transitioned distribution of Monster Energy Drinks in Wisconsin to Coca-Cola Bottlers early in January 2017 and are making good progress in the United States in non-traditional channels including Foodservice accounts. In EMEA, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola Bottlers in Bahrain, Mauritius, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates. In EMEA, in the first quarter of 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola Bottlers in Nigeria and Oman with additional launches planned in the second quarter of 2017 for Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, and Pakistan. In LATAM, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we transitioned distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola Bottlers in Brazil, Costa Rica, Ghana, and Panama. In the first quarter of 2017, we launched distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola Bottlers in certain countries in the Caribbean and transitioned distribution to Coca-Cola Bottlers in certain other smaller markets in that geographic region. In China, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola Bottlers in selected markets that includes Shanghai, Hunan Province, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Zhanjiang and Hainan in China. We also commenced distribution in the Maldives in the fourth quarter of 2016. We have received approval for our products in India and are planning to re-launch Monster in India later this year. As previously reported, we successfully completed our acquisition of the concentrated flavor business operated by American Fruits & Flavors on April 1, 2016. As a result of the AFF transaction, we achieved raw material cost savings of $22 million in the 2016 fourth quarter, which were broadly in line with expectations. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13-weeks through February 18, 2017, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 0.6 of a percent versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 0.1% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 7.3%, and sales of Full Throttle decreased 6.3%. Sales of Red Bull increased 0.8 of a percent, sales of Rockstar decreased by 0.9 of a percent, sales of 5-Hour decreased 5.7% and sales of AMP decreased 24.6%. According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended February 18, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increased 0.1 of a percent over the same period last year. Sales of Monster decreased by 0.9 of a percent over the same period last year while NOS was up 6.2% and Full Throttle sales decreased 6.2%. Sales of Red Bull increased 5.7 of a percent, Rockstar was down 4.5%, 5-Hour was down 8.5%, and AMP was down 25.5%. We pointed out that the energy shots category has been declining for some time and if we exclude the energy shots category, Energy Plus Coffee and Protein Drinks where we have experienced production capacity shortages. For the four weeks ended February 18, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channels in dollars in fact increased by 1.4% over the same period last year. And on this basis, sales of Monster increased by 1.6%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended February 18, 2017, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel including energy shots in dollars decreased by 0.4 of a point over the same period last year to 35%. NOS share increased 0.2 of a point to 4.3% and Full Throttle sales decreased 0.1 of a point to 1%. Red Bull share increased 0.2 of a point to 34.7%, Rockstar share was down 0.4 of a point to 8%, 5-Hour share was lower by 0.7 of a point to 7.6% and AMP decreased 0.5 of a point to 1.3%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended February 18, 2017, sales of Energy Plus Coffee Drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel decreased 5.1% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 19.7% lower than the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy were 12.6% higher. We continue to experience production capacity shortages for Java Monster which I will address later in the call. According to Nielsen in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12-weeks ended January 7, 2017, the energy drink category decreased 5% in dollars, due largely to lower pricing of private label brands. Monster sales increased 1% versus year ago. Our market share increased 1.8 share points to 30%, Red Bull sales decreased 2% and its market share increased 0.9 of a point to 38.2%, Rockstar sales decreased 6% and its market share decreased 0.2 of a point to 18.7%. According to Nielsen, all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 23.9% during the month of January 2017. Monster sales increased 22.3%. Our market share in value decreased 0.4 of a point to 26.8% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 22.7%. Burn's market share decreased two points to 3.4%. Red Bull sales decreased 8.9% and its market share decreased by 4.1 points to 11.4%. Vive 100's market share increased 9.6 points to 37.8%, while Boost's market share decreased 4.8 points to 13.6%. The transition to the KO bottler system in August 2016, while initially slow has since improved and we are now seeing wider availability of Monster in the traditional freight channel in Mexico. According to Nielsen, Monster's new medical distribution in the traditional freight channel grew from 10% in January 2016 to 24% in January 2017. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single month which was a short period that may offer be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the offshore convenience chain which dominate the market. Sales in the offshore convenience chain turn to be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drinks brands during a particular month. Consequently such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen in a 13-week period ended December 2016, the actual 13-week periods varied by a few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 13.5% to 15.4% in Great Britain, from 20.3% to 22.9% in France, from 13.4% to 15.2% in Germany, from 8.7% to 9.5% in Italy, from 8.9% to 12.4% in Ireland, from 7.1% to 10.9% in Norway, and from 8.8% to 12% in the Czech Republic. In the same period, Monster's market share grew from 10.9% to 11.1% in Sweden, from 8.7% to 10.5% in Belgium, and from 23.8% to 27.2% in Spain. Monster's retail market share in value for the 13-weeks ending December 2016 as compared to the same period last year decreased from 6.7% to 5% in the Netherlands. Monster's retail market share in value for the 13-weeks ending December 2016 grew from 15.8% to 16% in South Africa. According to IRI, Monster's market share in Greece increased in the 13-weeks ended December 2016 from 28.2% to 28.5%. I would like to point out that Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels raised by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country-to-country. According to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share in value in Chile increased to 26.9% in January 2017 as compared to 19.9% last year and also just two months since the KO bottler system, Monster's market share in value in Brazil grew to 5% in December 2016 as compared 3.7% in the same period last year. In South Korea Monster's retail market share in value increased from 13.3% to 23.7% in December 2016 compared to the same period last year. According to INTAGE Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 38.6% to 43.3% in December 2016. According to IRI in Australia Monster's market share in value grew from 3.1% to 6.3% in December. Going to IRI in New Zealand Monster's market share in value grew from 2.3% to 5.7% for the last four weeks ending December 4, 2016, versus the same period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 17% from $585.1 million to $684.4 million from the comparable period last year. Gross sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 14.3% from $677.7 million to $774.8 million for the comparable period last year. Net sales for Monster Energy Drinks segment in the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $3.2 million of foreign currency movements. The comparative gross and net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment of $677.7 million and $585.1 million respectively for the 2015 fourth quarter were impacted by advanced purchases made by the companies customers due to a pre-announced price increase effective August 31, 2015, on certain of the company's Monster Energy Brand energy drinks. The company estimates that both gross and net sales for the 2015 fourth quarter for the Monster Energy Drinks segment were reduced by approximately $12 million and $11 million respectively as a result of such advanced purchases. Gross and net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the 2016 fourth quarter after adjusting the 2015 fourth quarter comparisons for advanced purchases increased by 12.4% and 14.8% respectively. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $64.5 million for the fourth quarter as compared to $60.4 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment were negatively impacted by approximately 0.1 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. Net sales of the other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $4.7 million in the 2016 fourth quarter. There were no sales for the other segment in the comparable 2015 fourth quarter. We continue to experience production capacity shortages for our retooled products Java Monster and Muscle Monster. We are taking steps to address the issues including securing products from Europe, but anticipate that it will take a number of months before production availability allows us to restore normal supply patterns and fully meet consumer demand that exists for these products. We estimate that sales in the quarter was negatively impacted by approximately $22 million as a result of such production capacity shortages. Net sales to customers outside of the United States were $193.5 million in the 2016 fourth quarter compared to $145.3 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. In local currencies, net sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately $3.3 million higher. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, net sales in the fourth quarter in local currencies increased 40% and 33% in dollars over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 53.4% in the same period last year to 52.8% during the quarter. For the full-year of 2016, net sales increased 36% in local currencies and 30% in dollars over 2015. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 48.4% in 2015 to 51.1% in 2016. Monster continued to gain momentum and increased market share throughout Europe in the fourth quarter, in particular, in Great Britain, Germany, Spain, France, Czech Republic, Ireland, Poland, and Norway. Monster achieved increased sales guidance as well as increased market share. In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 53.1% in dollars and 41.1% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 49.6% in the same period last year to 44.1% during the 2016 fourth quarter. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 45.1% or 25.1% in local currency, primarily due to the strengthening of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar as compared to the same quarter last year. We continue to experience strong performance in Japan. In South Korea, net sales increased 135.9% or 130.3% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, and Guam, net sales increased 3.6%, modest 3.4% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year. As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead of plans for local production in India with a view to reentering the market in 2017. In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, gross sales in the fourth quarter increased 20.7% in dollars and 23.6% in local currencies. Net sales in the fourth quarter increased 19.7% and 21.8% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 48.9% in the same period last year to 52.5% during the 2016 fourth quarter. Net sales increased in Brazil 115.3% in dollars or 117.2% in local currency largely due to the transition of Monster's Coca-Cola bottlers, which took place on November 1, 2016. Net sales in Chile increased 148.6% in dollars and 137.7% in local currencies. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $377.6 million compared to $2.18 billion at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments were $220.6 million compared to $744.6 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term investments decreased to $2.4 million from $15.3 million at December 31, 2015. Accounts receivable increased to $448.1 million at December 31, 2016, from $353 million at December 31, 2015. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 48.2 days compared to 43.2 days at December 31, 2015. Inventories increased to $162 million from $156.1 million at December 31, 2015. Average days of inventory was 57 days at December 31, 2016, compared to 58 days at December 31, 2015. In September 2016, we launched Mutant, an exciting Super Soda in limited convenience store in certain U.S. markets with encouraging sales per point of distribution. For the 13-weeks ended January 21, 2017, for Nielsen total U.S. convenience, Mutant had the highest dollar share gain of any single served bottling soft drinks brand. For single served packages sold in convenience stores during the same dollars, Mutant outsold a number of well established single served brands such as 7 Up. We remain confident about the potential of this brand. We are planning to launch of our new Hydro line which is a non-carbonated largely treated energy drink, is packaged in a unique 16.9 ounce PET can, the size which is exclusive to us in the U.S. at this time. We are planning to launch Hydro for the retail trade towards the end of March or early April. Monster Energy Ultra Violet was launched exclusively with Sam's Club and will be expanded to all channels at the end of March 2017. We are also planning to launch Full Throttle Orange at the end of March. We have a robust innovation pipeline and further launches are planned for the remainder of 2017. We estimate January 2017 gross sales to be approximately 10.4% higher than in January 2016. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate January 2017 gross sales to be approximately 11.6% higher than in January 2016. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances where our boxes are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates of which we invoice such bottlers. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. With regard to litigation between the Company and the San Francisco City Attorney, we advice that the action was settled in January 2017 on terms acceptable to company. The settlement does not include any penalty under California's Unfair Competition Law, any funding or admission of liability or wrongdoing or any change in the formula -- to the formulation of Monster Energy Drinks or to whom the drinks may be sold. In consideration of release of clients and dismissal of the action with prejudice, the company agreed to maintain the various current marketing and labeling practices for its energy drink products through December 31, 2018. On February 28, 2017, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. No availability remains under the previously authorized share repurchase programs. In conclusion I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, as previously reported our acquisition of AFF represents an important milestone for the company and gives us ownership of our proprietary formulas for our principal products. We recognize the reduction in operating costs of $22 million in the fourth quarter as a result of the acquisition. Two, North American and international gross margins remained healthy. Three, while the U.S. Nielsen market statistics showed that the energy category slowed in the U.S. towards the end of the fourth quarter equivalent getting of the first quarter -- equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world showed that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. Currency exchange rates continue to affect our results. The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum, and add to the company's sales. We are excited about the prospect for our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China, one of the largest energy drink markets globally. We have successfully transitioned additional international countries to Coca-Cola bottlers in the fourth quarter and will be transitioning a number of other markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in 2017. I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. And our first question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is now open.
Bill Chappell: Just a little more color around the fourth quarter on both tenants. You said, lower promotional allowances and then also on the top-line. On the promotional allowances, is that something that that was more year-over-year comparison or is that something that we should expect in general going forward in 2017? And then on the top-line was there, you may be could you break out was there much benefit from kind of the Mutant sell-in, from the China sell-in or was that negligible to kind of the top-line growth?
Rodney Sacks: I think most of the answers comparatively based on a quarter by -- comparable quarter for last year.
Bill Chappell: Okay. You said it was a benefit to gross profit that's why I was wondering.
Rodney Sacks: I think we made the point, Bill, when we spoke about gross profit that the additional promotional allowances in the quarter and other items had the impact of increasing gross profit margin by approximately 2%. So in that I think what we try to suggest that these promotional allowances, the reduction in promotional allowances may not necessarily endure over the quarters in 2017.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Mark Astrachan: Hey guys, just one housekeeping. I think you still need to answer Bill's other question on I think Mutant sell-in. Also my question is just on general sell-in and sell through trends, so you touched on this at the Investor Meeting in January about untracked channels contributing more than you'd seen historically, obviously that disconnect had widened pretty substantially here. So may be if you could sort of touch on what you think is contributing to that and I'm talking specifically about the U.S. may be sort of methodology gathering what you're doing in universities, foodservice, vending et cetera, just sort of much specificity there if you could give would be helpful? Please.
Rodney Sacks: We're just dealing with Mutant. Mutant we went through this a few times. We repositioned Mutant in selected channels at full pricing. We've not been aggressive in our promotion. If you look at the average pricing in Nielsen, Mutant is at average pricing in all the different periods depending which period you look at it's still above 196. If you compare that, that's quite a substantial premium to the other soft drinks and its main competitive soft drink that we're looking at competing, with which is Mountain Dew. And so we have strategically not promoted Mutant during the winter period. We are taking steps to deal with expanded distribution. We will obviously increase our promotional and other activities around the brand as we continue to go into spring and summer. So when we look at the numbers and we look at the sales per point, we think the sales per point are pretty good in relation to a lot of the other well established brands in the area. If you look at the last four weeks that has dropped off a little bit again because of the -- we believe the lack of promotional spend and behind the brand that that was intentional in this period of time. It is a soda and we are looking to as I expand distribution, expand the channels and also become substantially more active in the promotion that's driving us starts going into spring now. So we are still positive about the brand and its prospects and sell to particularly where we have seen at the substantial price premium, we've seen substantial sales per point that are higher than a lot of very well established brands that are being around for a long time.
Hilton Schlosberg: I think there is one other point that we need to focus on and that is that the permanent shift will be done and the placements will be done in March. So we launched Mutant off-cycle, which means that in many cases the product is on space where the bottlers could find space for the product. And in March, the sets, the new sets will become available in the convenience and gas channel where the product is sold.
Rodney Sacks: There are another, couple of other key channels where we have secured listings and we will be. Those are things will start coming through in April and May. So we do have ongoing plans to basically ramp up for put effort and focus behind the brand.
Hilton Schlosberg: I think it's also anticipated that the -- this is not a full blowing launch; it is also called a bubble up launch. There is only launch in convenience retail in chains in convenience retail that was rolled out to Mom and Pop to a limited degree and that's where we're at this time. As Rodney said, there will be further listing that have been secured that will take place starting in April.
Rodney Sacks: Then just talking about the Mark's question, there is a bigger divergence but that is the fact of matter is that the non-major channel are continuing to expand for us. We are dealing in the non-major area. We also have some concerns about the accuracy and the represented nature of the convenience data which does seem to us to be a little more inaccurate in relation to as compared for example to grocery where we think there is a closer correlation and a better read. And that's just a fact of life. But we are where we are on our sales and we continue to see increases, although clearly there is some softening in the convenience channel.
Hilton Schlosberg: And also don't forget that the Java's shortages that we experienced, they also affect.
Rodney Sacks: Yes, affect the whole channel and whole category.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Amit Sharma: Hi, just a quick navigation going back to the question there is no case to sort of like the inventory build-up in the channels because of divergent Euro [ph] sales?
Rodney Sacks: Sorry. Just say that again?
Amit Sharma: So we shouldn't view there is inventory build-up in the channel as suggested by the divergent Euro sales and slowdown in channel, you're not seeing inventory build-up there?
Rodney Sacks: No, not that we've seen. And I think that the bottlers would be -- will be building up inventory of Monster in their system either.
Amit Sharma: Got it. And then as we think about Hydro launching later this year, would you expect Hydro also to be a bubble up launch or would you expect that to be a little bigger launch more in line with your traditional products?
Rodney Sacks: I think it would be -- it will be more in line with our traditional launches. But again we generally do launch through a bubble up process, somewhat more or less extensive but that's generally how we've always launched our products, it's regarding to selective chains and into launch but it will be a more extensive launch than we had for Mutant. Mutant was very exceptional launch and it was very limited by design and by strategy and being off cycle Hydro will be a more broader based launch going out. But clearly initial focus will be on the convenience and gas and independent channels, et cetera.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Kevin Grundy: Thanks. Good evening guys. First one, housekeeping question just point of clarification on the January gross sales update, if I'm not mistaken, there is an extra selling day in the month of January and then I think that there is one less in the first quarter. So Hilton perhaps if you could just clarify that that would be helpful. And then the broader question on Brazil, which looks like it's starting to bounce back now with the distributor change behind you. How high can that share go, how quickly can you guys ramp in that market. Can you give us any sort of parameters for which you think you can grow market share it's like the 27% that you have in Chile is that, is that reasonable and over what period of time. Thanks.
Rodney Sacks: I think there is an extra selling day in January.
Hilton Schlosberg: Extra selling day in January, that is correct.
Rodney Sacks: Yes. And I'm not sure about the quarter but in my review one less in the quarter. We know there is one less in February but we haven't done the exercise. So I think just mathematically that is right.
Hilton Schlosberg: Yes, exactly. We're -- just to be clear, I mean, we run our business quarter-by-quarter and while selling days obviously are important because sales have generated on each day. We've never looked at our business and never tried to explain our business based on one or less selling day and I just want to be clear on that.
Rodney Sacks: On Brazil, Brazil a very unique market. The country at the moment is struggling obviously talk of it being almost in the depression and so there are challenges. We also have a group of 10 bottlers; it's a little bit different to Chile. Chile there were two main bottlers they really, we started to have some pretty -- we really had some pretty good momentum for the brand. It was well established, it doesn't have a deep distribution but where it was, it was already selling into the high-teens and doing pretty nicely. So when the two Coke bottlers in Chile took it over, they really didn't price the brand and obviously we're able to sort of more structured market, we're able to expand the market, rather up probably more quickly and more I think efficiently than is the case in Brazil. And so the results have been very good. And we've been very encouraged by the results. In the case of the Brazilian market, it is a much more non-traditional market you have literally well over a million of these little traditional stores all over the place and they are audit get you, audit of service and grow invariably, there is a very, very large and interpret wholesale system that helps get to these stores and it's just you're just not comparing apples-and-apples. So we've got to manage a group of 10 odd bottlers in a very different environment, countries and also that is going through tough financial conditions at the moment. But that being said, we think that will take some time, but as it has in many of the current markets where you do deal with these very big bottlers or basically groups of bottlers it takes time for them to get coordinated and get their system going. But when it does start going, it does really work, it does improve and so we're very encouraged by what we've seen. We are at a point now where we are selling at a rate which is higher than we've ever sold even when we were with our previous distributor at the peak before we announced the KO transaction and they tended to lose interest in the brand and stop putting the effort behind this because they were also a good distributor. And so we're encouraged by where we're going but it will take time to build up. The good news is that it's a big energy market. We do quite nicely with Burn there and really these by far the largest player is Red Bull. That is really our main competitor and we are at sort of a similar price point, which for us means that we would -- gives us a lot of opportunity to grow into that market against the Red Bull share which is at a premium price and is not at the low-end. They do have low end brands but at least we know there is a lot of good business to be gone off at this but it's going to take time to develop.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Laurent Grandet: Hi Rod, hi Hilton. A quick follow-up on Mutant and you mentioned earlier this year the share that you would be launching in Mutant in Wal-Mart in Q2 this year. Could you please give us a bit more color my understanding was it, it would be about 1,000 stores from April, with its first shipment in March. Should we think now differently or --?
Rodney Sacks: I'm not sure, not sure where you got that from.
Laurent Grandet: Okay. Well that's I mean a question I ask at some point and to some retailers and so are you; are you confirming or not confirming?
Rodney Sacks: Not confirming anything.
Laurent Grandet: Okay. So I've got a chance then for a second question. Regarding the on-premise, I mean you mentioned, I mean you're making lots of progress there. Two quarters ago, you mentioned, I mean you are testing in McDonalds and Dunkin Donuts my understanding here is that you would be launching in Dunkin Donuts. So could you abate us on those two tests and either any other big customers we should think off from that you are making progress?
Rodney Sacks: Well McDonalds the test is continuing, they don't make mutinous decision, so that test is continuing. And with Dunkin Donuts, we are distributed in a number of their outlets, so that's not. I mean we alluded earlier to the fact that we were launching Mutant in a number of -- number of chains later this year and you can read into that, but certainly one of them is a major retailer.
Hilton Schlosberg: I think it's premature at this time to give more detail on that launch. We'll start going through, as we said in spring and then I think that would be in a much better position to give you much more color on Mutant's and the activities that we have then behind it when we report our first quarter results in the first week of May.
Operator: Thank you. And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks.
Rodney Sacks: On the half of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the Company. We continue to believe in the Company and our growth strategy, and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the Company, both at home and abroad, and in particular, to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottler system internationally. We are also particularly excited by the new opportunities that we have going forward, with a portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world, comprised of our Monster Energy brand, together with the strategic brands, as well as Mutant. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2016 Q3  (2016-11-03 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Rodney Sacks - Chairman and CEO Hilton Schlosberg - Vice Chairman and President Tom Kelly - SVP, Finance
Analysts: Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Mark Astrachan - Stifel Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Vivien Azer - Cowen & Company Kevin Grundy - Jefferies
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Corporation Third Quarter 2016 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may begin.
Rodney Sacks: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I’m Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today, as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I’d like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the Company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed February 29, 2016, as well as our most recent report on Form 10-Q filed August, 2016, including the sections contained therein entitled risk factors and forward-looking statements, for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation on the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated November 3, 2016. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. Sales in the beverage industry in the third quarter continued to be weak on a global basis. In the third quarter, net sales were $788 million, up 4.1% from $756.6 million in the third quarter of 2015. The Company achieved record gross sales of $913.3 million up 5.9% from $862.4 million in the third quarter of 2015. The comparative growth in net sales of $862.4 million and $756.6 million respectively for the 2015 third quarter was positively impacted by advance purchases made by the Company’s customers due to a pre-announced price increase effective August 31, 2015, on certain of the Company’s Monster Energy brand energy drinks. The Company estimates that both gross and net sales for the 2015 third quarter increased by approximately $12 million and the $11 million respectively as a result of such advance purchases. Gross and net sales for the 2016 third quarter, after adjusting the 2015 third quarter comparatives for advance purchases, increased by 7.4% and 5.7%, respectively. In this regard, I would like to point out that the increase in Monster’s net sales for the 2016 third quarter is hurdling a significant increase in the third quarter of 2015 over the prior year’s third quarter. Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced gross sales by approximately $4.8 million and net sales by approximately $2.6 million in the 2016 third quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 63.8% as compared to 61.5% for the comparable 2015 third quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the cost of goods savings and as a result of the AFF transaction and product mix.  Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.1%, compared to 3.5% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.1% compared to 10.7% in the same quarter a year ago. Increased sponsorship and endorsement costs, as well as increases in certain other marketing expenses including marketing, research and social media were the principal reasons for the increase in selling expenses. In-store demos and premiums were also higher in the quarter. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.7% as compared to 8.8% in the same quarter last year. Payroll expenses were up $7.3 million, primarily to support the strategic brands that we acquired from Coca-Cola, and stock-based compensation and non-cash item was 3.3 million higher. Distributor termination costs were $4.7 million in the third quarter, as compared to $2.5 million in the 2015 third quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and safety. and sale of the Company’s product were $4.9 million in the 2016 third quarter, as compared to $3.4 million in the 2015 third quarter. Legal and professional costs related to intellectual property matters particularly in China were $2.5 million in the 2016 third quarter as compared to $0.8 million in the comparable 2015 third quarter. Our effective tax rate in the quarter decreased from 39.4% in the 2015 third quarter to 33.8% in the 2016 third quarter, primarily due in part to a one-time benefit related to a prior period domestic production deduction. On an ongoing basis, we expect that our normalized tax rate will be approximately 36%. Net income was $191.6 million in the 2016 third quarter compared to net income of $174.6 million in the 2015 third quarter, an increase of 9.8%. Net income per diluted share increased 17.5% to $0.99 in the quarter due in part to a lower share count as a result of the completion of the modified Dutch auction in June 2016. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from $208.1 million at September 30, 2015, to $194.4 million at September 30, 2016. We are continuing to make good progress on the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers internationally. In United States, we’re continuing to see improvements in our quality of distribution. In the third quarter, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Mexico, Colombia and Chile. We commenced with the transition to Coca-Cola bottlers in Brazil earlier this week and we’ll transition Panama and Costa Rica later this month. We commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Denmark, Montenegro and Ukraine in the third quarter. In July, we successfully transitioned Monster to the Coca-Cola bottlers in South Africa, which occurred at the same time, as the restructuring of the Coca-Cola bottlers in South Africa took place. After a slow start, we’re seeing better execution in South Africa. During the quarter, we also commenced distribution of Monster in Botswana and Zimbabwe, and transitioned Swaziland, Réunion and Mauritius. Over the fourth quarter, we plan to launch Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in additional African countries. We are making good progress in Nigeria with regard to both product registration and co-packing arrangements and are planning to launch Monster by early 2017 in Nigeria. In October, we commenced sales of Monster through the Coca-Cola bottlers in Turkey. In the fourth quarter, we are planning to launch Monster through Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of central Asian and Middle Eastern countries with further launches to follow in 2017. Following the conclusion of negotiations with Coca-Cola bottlers in China, we commenced the launch of Monster beginning with Beijing in September and Shanghai and Hunan province in October. We expect Guangzhou, Shenzhen and potentially other markets to be launched in the fourth quarter and are planning to launch Monster in additional territories in China during 2017. We are currently awaiting approval for our product in India. As we previously reported, we successfully completed our acquisition of a concentrated flavor business operated by American Fruits & Flavors on April 1, 2016. As a result of the AFF transaction, we achieved raw material cost savings of $23.3 million in the 2016 third quarter, which were broadly in line with the expectations. According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through September 24, 2016, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 3.5% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 6.4% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 2.4%, and sales of Full Throttle decreased 8.2%, sales of Red Bull increased 2.4%, sales of Rockstar increased by 3.8%, sales of 5-Hour decreased 4.9% and sales of AMP decreased 30.2%. According to Nielsen for the five weeks ended September 24, 2016, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increased 2.3% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased 5.1% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 3.2% and Full Throttle sales decreased 4.6%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 1.4%, Rockstar was up 0.5%, 5-Hour was down 4.5% and AMP was down 27.1%. According to Nielsen, for the five weeks ended September 24, 2016 Monster’s market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increased by 1 point over the same period last year to 35.6%. NOS’ share remained the same at 3.9% and Full Throttle’s share decreased 0.1 of 1 point to 1%. Red Bull share decreased 0.3 points to 35%. Rockstar share was down 0.1 of 1 point to 7.9%. 5-Hour share was lower by 0.5 points and 7.6%, and AMP share decreased 0.6 points to 1.5%. According to Nielsen, for the five weeks ended September 24, 2016, sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 19.1% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 18.2% higher than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy were 21.7% higher. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended August 20, 2016, the energy drink category decreased 4%. Monster sales increased 1% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 1.6 share points to 31.3%, Red Bull sales decreased 4% and its market share increased 0.2 points to 39.2%, Rockstar sales decreased 11% and its market share decreased 1.2 points to 15.6%. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 36.3% during the month of September 2016. Monster sales increased 12.6%, our market share in value decreased 4.7 points to 22.3% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn, one of our acquired strategic brands increased 28.4%, although Burn’s market share decreased 0.3 points of 1 point to 4.9%. Red Bull sales decreased 11.7% and its market share decreased by 6.3 points to 11.7%. Vive 100’s market share increased 15.4 points to 44.2%, while Boost’s market share decreased 5.9 points to 9.3%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended September 2016, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets. Monster’s retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 11.9% to 14.2% in Great Britain, from 19.4% to 22.6% in France, from 12.3% to 14.9% in Germany, from 22.2% to 25.6% in Spain, from 8.8% to 10.5% in Belgium, from 9% to 10.5% in Sweden, from 6% to 11% in Norway, from 9.5% to 11.4% in the Czech Republic and from 6.1% to 6.4% in the Netherlands. According to IRI, Monster’s market share in Greece decreased for the 13 weeks prior to the period ended September 2016 from 28.4% to 27.4%. For the 13-week period ended August 2016 according to Nielsen, Monster’s retail market share in Ireland grew from 8.6% to 11.2%. And for the 13-week period September 2016 Monster’s retail market share in value decreased, however, from 15.6% to 13.1% in South Africa, primarily due to increased distribution of Dragon, a new low-priced energy drink, although retail sales of Monster increased. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country-to-country. According to Nielsen, Monster’s retail market share in value in Chile increased to 21.6% in September 2016 as compared to 18.2% last year and Monster’s market share in Brazil declined from 3.9% to 2.6% in September 2016, as compared to the same period last year. In South Korea, Monster’s retail market share in value increased from 10.7% to 23.7% in September, compared to the same period last year, and according to INTAGE, Monster’s market share value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 39.2% to 41.7% in September of 2016. According to IRI, in Australia Monster’s market share in value grew from 3.5% to 6% in September 2016 and in New Zealand Monster’s market share in value grew from 2.2% to 6% for the last four weeks ending October 2, 2016 versus the same period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately 1.6 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the third quarter of 2016 increased 3.4% from $686.7 million to $710.1 million from the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Company’s Strategic Brands segment were negatively impacted by approximately $1 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $72.1 million for the third quarter as compared to $69.9 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF were $5.7 million in the 2016 third quarter. There were now sales for the other segment in the comparable 2015 third quarter. Continued increases in sales of the ready-to-drink coffee category in the U.S. including our Java Monster line bodes well for the future. However, their exists limited production in the U.S. for such products which requires a rethought process due to the use of fresh milk and cream. Due to production capacity constraints, resulting from production and maintenance issues with co-packers, product shortages have been experienced in the industry. We are taking steps to address the issues but anticipate that it will take a number of month before production availability will be balanced with consumer demand. Sales of Java Monster were impacted by such shortages in September and October, and we anticipate that sales will continue to be impacted in the foreseeable future. Net sales for customers outside the United States were $190.8 million in the 2016 third quarter compared to a $170.6 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. Net sales to customers outside of the United States were higher in local currencies by approximately $2.6 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the Company’s military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. Net sales in EMEA in the third quarter of 2016 in dollars were 14% higher than in the same period last year. In local currencies, net sales in the region were 19% higher than in the same period last year. The foregoing differences were primarily due to the weakening of the British pound against the U.S. dollar. Gross sales were 11.6% higher in dollars and 18% higher in local currencies. Gross profit in this region, as a percentage of net sales, decreased from 51.5% in the same period last year to 50.5% during the 2016 third quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from 51.5% in the same period last year to 52.5% during the 2016 third quarter in local currencies. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increase market share in Europe. In particular in Germany, France, Spain, Great Britain, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, the Czech Republic and Ireland, Monster achieved sales gains and continued to increase its market share. We are pleased with the performance of the Monster Ultra line in EMEA region, which is now available in 25 European countries and was launched in South Africa in July. We anticipate that the Ultra line will be sold in almost all of our Western European markets by the end of this year. In Asia Pacific, net sales in the third quarter increased 34.2% in dollars and 20.4% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 49.4% in the same period last year to 46.6% during the 2016 third quarter. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 28.2% or 7.2% in local currency, primarily due to the strengthening of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar as compared to the same quarter last year. We continue to experience strong performance in Japan. In Korea -- South Korea, net sales increased 125.7%, 127.2% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Guam, net sales increased 22.2% or 19.9% in local currencies, as compared to the same quarter last year. In Singapore, net sales increased 109.1% or 111.1% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with the planning for local production in India with a view to reentering the market in 2017. In Latin America, which includes Mexico and the Caribbean, gross sales in the third quarter decreased 6.1% in dollars and increased 3.9% in local currencies. Net sales in the third quarter decreased 15% in dollars and decreased 6.2% in local currencies, over the same period last year. This region was impacted by foreign currency exchange rates and higher trade promotions in 2016. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 50.3% in the same period last year to 47.6% during the 2016 third quarter. In Mexico, gross sales increased 3.8% in dollars and 21.5% in local currency in September 2016. Net sales decreased in part due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher trade spending in 2016. However, although Nielsen reported Monster’s market share decreased during September 2016, Monster sales at retail in Mexico grew 12.6% during September 2016. Net sales decreased in Brazil, largely due to the overall difficult economic and market conditions, together with the ongoing uncertainties for our distributor relating to the Coca-Cola transaction and the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took place on November 1. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $341.5 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $2.18 billion at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments were $257.7 million compared to $744.6 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term investments decreased to $9.5 million from $15.3 million at December 31, 2015. Accounts receivable increased to $467.3 million at September 30, 2016 from $353 million at December 31, 2015. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 46.5 days at September 30, 2016 compared to 43.2 days at December 31, 2015 and 43 days at September 30, 2015. Inventories increased to $167.8 million from $156.1 million at December 31, 2015. Average days of inventory was 53 days at September 30, 2016 compared to 58 days of inventory at December 31, 2015 and the 59.4 days at September 30, 2015. In late September, we launch Mutant, an exciting super soda in the U.S. that is positioned as refreshment energized in limited convenience stores in certain markets with encouraging early results. We experienced some production challenges with Mutant in early September, which have now been largely, resulting in very limited distribution for Mutant in the quarter. The number of retailers stocking Mutant increased substantially in October. We have an additional new product planned for later this year and are working on new product that we’re planning to introduce early in 2017 and which includes our new Hydro line that we previously announced. On October 14, 2016, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved Board of Directors approved a 3.1 stock split of its common stock to be effected in the 200% stock dividend. On November 9, 2016 each stockholder of record will receive two additional shares of common stock for each share of common stock owned at the close of business Eastern Time on October 26, 2016. We estimate October 2016 gross sales on a foreign-exchange adjusted basis to be approximately 12.3% higher than in October 2015. In this regard, we point out that according to Nielsen, for the five weeks ended September 24, 2016 for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 3.5% versus the same period a year ago, while sales of Monster grew 6.4% in the same period versus a year ago. We caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I’d like to summarize some recent positive points. Our acquisition of AFF is exciting and represents an important milestone for the Company through the ownership of the proprietary formulas for our principal products. Our ability to utilize the full benefits of the transaction through a reduction in operating costs commenced with the third quarter. This transaction will be accretive to the Company’s earnings. North American and international gross margins remain healthy. The U.S. Nielsen market statistics and equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. Currency exchange rates continue to affect our results. While the net difference was on balance not material, unfavorable exchange rates in the UK, our largest market in EMEA, negatively affected our EMEA results following Brexit. Similarly, unfavorable currency exchange rates in Mexico also negatively affected our Latin American results. On the other hand, favorable currency results in Japan positively affected our Asia Pacific results. The new additions to the monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the Company’s sales. We are excited about the prospects for our new Mutant beverage. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets. In particular, I would like to call out the launch of Monster in China and the enormous growth potential for us in one of the largest energy drink markets globally. We have successfully transitioned additional international countries to Coca-Cola bottlers, and we have reached an advanced stage to transition many more markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in the fourth quarter and in 2017. I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Judy Hong: Thank you. Hi, everyone. So, Rodney, I guess just maybe you can help us quantify how much the production shortages in Java perhaps hurt the Q3 reported sales and then the October number? Because it looks like in Q3, I know the advance purchases last year was a tough comp but even beyond that it looks like, there was a pretty sizeable gap between reported and the takeaway data. And then just secondly on China, maybe, you can just help us what you’ve seen so far in terms of the launches you’ve done in Beijing and Shanghai, and what’s been the response to the launches? I know it’s early, but just any color there would be great.
Rodney Sacks: Hilton will speak about the coffee Java issue, if you’re able to. It’s been difficult for us, because we’re just trying to get a handle on what impact it’s had with different bottlers, because again, it’s affected different bottlers in a different way, and we were not certain of how much inventory they’ve had. What we have seen is that in stores there have been signs put up by our major competitor who we also had shortages. So it’s really been difficult to determine. I think it affected our October number probably more than our September number, and that’s where we’re trying to get handle on that at the moment. If you’re able to give any more color?
Hilton Schlosberg: Judy, we are really trying to get and exercise together because there was some inventory that we had obviously in the system that we were able to get out in the quarter. But we’re still reviewing those numbers and we’ll be in a better position to talk about that sometime later. But I think there will be a more pronounced impact in Q4.
Rodney Sacks: Judy with regard to your second question on China, basically the way we launch generally is through a soft launch and to go into the smaller stores, independent convenience stores first and start to get the product established and sampled cold. Today, we probably secured probably of the order, and it’s a very rough guess from what we’ve discussed with our bottlers, about 50,000 accounts in the areas where we’ve already launched. We will be going into Guangzhou, Shenzhen pretty much within the next week or so. So, we are getting good distribution. We are getting good response to the product. And so, we just are very hopeful and excited that we will be able to continue to expand. There is a massive universe of stores available to us, it’s a very big country. Probably by the end of the year, we should have launched Monster in probably areas that would be covered by about 18% of the population or and those areas represent our estimate at the moment is about 30-33% of the current energy market, once we’ll have got through December. So, it’s a big market and we’re obviously planning to do -- there is little bit of -- there will be a bit of a hiatus between beginning of January and until off the Chinese New Year. But once we’re through that, then we’re going to start focusing on launching pre-summer in China. Obviously that will be the thrust of our focus.
Hilton Schlosberg: But we can also say Judy that the teams are satisfied with the results and the bottlers are excited about the results, we’ve seen so far. So, it will help us well for the future.
Rodney Sacks: One thing I just wanted to clarify, I talked about the October gross sales on a foreign exchange adjusted basis 12.3; this was actually 12.6; the unadjusted basis was 12.3, just to give that clarification.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Your line is now open.
Mark Astrachan: The October number, wanted to come back that again, are there any differences in selling days from a year ago? And also if you could quantify roughly what the impact is from Mutant sell in or even China I guess would be helpful. And then just to go back to sort of the quarter itself. So, by my math, your U.S. legacy sales were down something like 1% in the third quarter; the scanner data shows up something, I don’t know, mid to high single-digits roughly. We know you talk about benefits from on track channel in the past. So, could you help just sort of quantify what is going on there, was there some selling ahead of third quarter; is there pent-up demand out there from an inventory standpoint, just sort of helping to reconcile that would be good?
Hilton Schlosberg: There is a whole bunch of questions. [Multiple speakers] Can you just start and then we can answer them one at a time?
Mark Astrachan: Okay, October. So, selling days, this year versus last year and then incremental benefits from Mutant in China?
Rodney Sacks: Okay. We’ll get to you that because we just don’t have it handy.
Mark Astrachan: Okay. And then, the other is, I calculated down one for your legacy U.S. business sales in the third quarter, obviously the scanner data has been better than that. So what gives?
Rodney Sacks: I think on the legacy sales, it’s just the timing issue.
Mark Astrachan: Okay. [Multiple speakers].
Rodney Sacks: Not there is any destocking or restocking or anything of that nature.
Hilton Schlosberg: Whenever we sell a concentrate with the legacy brands. And so what we -- what we see in Nielsen and what we are selling in concentrate is quite a significant disconnect, it’s not even as if we’re selling a finished product. We do sell finished products but in main, you talk about concentrate and there is a huge lag between where the concentrate is manufactured by the bottlers and then sold in the market and sold to consumers.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes the Laurent Grandet of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Laurent Grandet: I would like to understand a bit more about Mutant. I know, I mean it’s very early stage right now. And it’s kind of a double effort [ph] for you in terms of profitability. So, any kind of calculation -- cannibalization between Mutant and your energy core brands would be helpful for us to understand. If it’s a good start and is there some legs in the future, could you give us some more color on this?
Rodney Sacks: Again, it’s been very early days on Mutant, but we’ve had some insight from three or four of the what we’d call representative or convenience chains. And the Mutant sales as a percentage of Mountain Dew, which is the main competitor, they are obviously going after, has been quite good. It varies quite a bit between the stores but whichever way you look at the percentages, it’s quite respectable. And everybody, including the retailers, have been quite surprised and quite happy with the sell-in. The actual level of Mutant that was sold in the quarter, I think that is Mark’s question -- one of Mark’s questions earlier was about 4.5 million in our numbers on a gross basis. And so, it really started late and it’s really just starting to ramp up now. And the whole strategy that we had with Mutant, just talking about Mutant generally, is we never intended at any time, it’s how we’ve launched all of our products, we didn’t intend to go out and secure execution and make a big splash on day one. It’s a bubbling up, we put it into convenience stores, we are being very specific about way we want to see it placed in the store and we feel that’s important. And the results of us doing that is actually the feedback we’ve got is that there is very, very minimal, if any cannibalization. So, we are achieving we believe our strategic objective to minimalize any cannibalization with Monster Energy Drinks. And so that is being achieved. We are pretty much across the board getting retailers buy in on our strategy and where it should be placed. There have been a few retailers that have resisted that. And in some cases, for that reason, we have not sold to those retailers. But we pretty much have very, very board acceptance and buying from retailers. And so far we are actually very encouraged by the sale rate for a new brand.
Tom Kelly: Also Mark, to answer your question, it was one extra day, selling day in October 2016 versus 2015.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Vivien Azer of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.
Vivien Azer: So, I was hoping, please, if you could just comment on the broader health of the energy drinks category. Given the torrid rates of growth that we’ve seen historically, I think it’s not unexpected to see the growth rate moderate. Do you feel like kind of this new run rate is sustainable or is there any kind of exogenous headwinds that you think may be weighing on category sales?
Rodney Sacks: Yes. That’s $1 million or $64 question -- $64,000 question. We have seen some sort of settling in the energy category. However, we’ve also got to bear in remind that I think over this period, we haven’t seen a lot of innovation. Our innovation, we’ve been dealing with new packaging, different packaging, it’s taken some time for us to get our hands around it. And so, if you take for example high growth coming out, we’re looking at the beginning of next year, Mutant really has just hit the shelves, just pretty days before the quarter-end. And our Cafe Monster product, which we’re looking at launching next year also it will come through next year sometime. We will have to obviously deal with the production issues, it’s one of the things -- one of the challenges we’ll face with Cafe Monster. But we think that if you’re looking at innovation, it really was probably pretty limited this year and that we think has been one of the reasons. But again, the category is more positive, it’s gone up and down over in the past, and we do believe that we will continue to see some increase in growth rates next year. But again, this is -- we don’t have any crystal ball to be able to do so.
Hilton Schlosberg: One of the other growth opportunities for us is in the non-traditional channels which are not measured by Nielsen? And we make a lot of headway with the Coca-Cola system in some of these non-traditional channels.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Kevin Grundy: Two detail-oriented questions from you. First on the getting back to the October sales update. Do you have the split between U.S. and international? That would be helpful just to kind of gauge how the U.S. may look versus what we’re currently seen in the Nielsen data, and any potential benefit there with shipments with respect to Mutant. That’s question number one if you have that handy. And question number two, the selling and distribution expense was elevated; you spoke to some of this in your prepared remarks. I know you don’t guide specifically. But given the push here internationally, particularly in China and a number of other markets, should that remain elevated -- should we expect that to remain elevated in the near to intermediate term?
Hilton Schlosberg: Okay. If we could talk about the numbers for October. The U.S. grew by just under 10%, 9.8%. And you can work out regarding international. So that’s the number for the U.S. Your second question on selling and operating expenses, obviously what we spoke about in the quarter was an increase -- a significant increase in endorsement and sponsorship costs and that’s something that maybe grow as we go forward, depending on when it takes the brand from a marketing perspective. So, we don’t give guidance and I broadly not give any guidance on selling expenses because a lot of that will determine on a number of initiatives that we’re considering at this time. Regarding operating expenses, I think there is -- the operating expenses other than selling expenses i.e. the admin expenses are probably largely in line where they will be in the foreseeable future of course depending on a lot of these legal costs and relating to the regulatory aspects and some of the -- the case is that we are still involved in, which are in fact reducing in number.
Kevin Grundy: Okay. Thank you.
Rodney Sacks: So, one of the things that -- the bumps that came in the series was the -- take on staff to really support the sales and marketing, put some marketing behind the strategic brands as we continue to -- we’re getting our hands around them, we may be able to look at some sort of rationalization on some of those costs going forward as we get to know the brands better and we get more focused on how we want to position these strategic brands going forward.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Rodney Sacks for any further remarks.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you. On the half of Monster, I’d like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the Company. We continue to believe in the Company and our growth strategy, and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the Company, both at home and abroad, and in particular, to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottler system internationally. We are particularly excited by the new opportunities that we have going forward, with a robust portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world, comprised of our Monster Energy brand, together with the strategic brands, as well as Mutant. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This concludes today’s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2016 Q2  (2016-08-05 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary
Analysts: Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. Evan Morris - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Monster Beverage Corporation's Second Quarter 2016 Financial Results. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session with instructions following at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. Now, I'll turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Please begin.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today, as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I'd like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed February 29, 2016, as well as our most recent report on Form 10-Q filed April 29, 2016, including the sections contained therein entitled risk factors and forward-looking statements, for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated August 4, 2016. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. As you are, no doubt aware, sales in the beverage industry in the second quarter continued to be weak on a global basis. We believe that it would be helpful to shareholders on this call to address our results on an adjusted basis after giving the effect to a number of selected items in addition to and not in lieu of our GAAP results. First, the results for the second quarter of 2016 were positively impacted by the accelerated recognition of deferred revenue of $5 million and negatively impacted by the modified Dutch tender stock repurchase expenses of $1.5 million, AFF transaction expenses of $3.6 million, as well as distributed termination costs of $25.3 million, resulting in a net negative impact on operating income in this quarter of $25.4 million. Second, net sales in the 2016 second quarter were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $4.1 million. Third, while the results for the comparable second quarter of 2015 were negatively impacted by distributed termination costs of $12.2 million and the Coca-Cola transaction expenses of $11.5 million, the results for that quarter were positively affected by the sale of Monster's non-energy business for $161.5 million during the quarter, which resulted in a net positive impact on operating income for such period of $137.7 million. Fourth, we accounted for the AFF transaction in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 805 for business combinations. The effect on contribution margin from the AFF raw material cost savings was minimal in the three months ended June 30, 2016, as inventory on hand prior to the AFF transaction, as well as the inventory acquired in the AFF transaction, were recorded at fair value and were not recognized through cost of goods sold until the end of the 2016 second quarter. As of June 30, 2016, the company's inventory on hand is recorded at the cost to AFF. As a result, the full extent of the raw material cost savings following the AFF transaction will be recognized in subsequent quarters. Had these savings been recognized in full in the current quarter, the raw material cost savings would've been approximately $24 million. In respect of AFF's sales to third-party customers, after recognizing the fair value adjustment to inventory, $0.6 million was recorded as contribution margin in the quarter. Fifth, our modified Dutch auction tender share repurchase was completed on June 15, 2016 and we did not benefit from the lower number of shares in the quarter. Consequently, we believe that these adjustments need to be taken into account in reviewing our results for the quarter. Let me turn to the results for the six months ended June 2016. The results for the six months ended June 2016 were positively impacted by the accelerated recognition of deferred revenue of $5 million and negatively impacted by stock repurchase expenses of $1.6 million, AFF transaction expenses of $4.5 million, as well as distributed termination costs of $28.7 million, resulting in a net negative impact on operating income in such period of $29.8 million. B, net sales in the first six months of 2016 were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $16.4 million. C, the results of the comparable six months of 2015 were negatively impacted by distributed termination costs of $218.2 million and the Coca-Cola Company transaction expenses of $15.1 million, but the results were positively affected by accelerated recognition of deferred revenue of $39.8 million and the sale of Monster's non-energy business for $161.5 million, which resulted in a net negative impact on operating income for such period of $32.1 million.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: There was a gain on the sale of the Monster non-energy business.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Yes. Our discussion earlier regarding the AFF raw material cost savings during the quarter is applicable in the same manner and to the same extent to the first half of 2016. Consequently, the full extent of the raw material cost savings following the AFF transaction will be recognized in subsequent quarters. We are continuing to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers worldwide. We have successfully concluded negotiations with many Coca-Cola bottlers in additional countries and are planning to launch Monster with those bottlers in most of their international markets in the near future. In the second quarter, we commenced distribution of Monster with the Coca-Cola bottlers in Peru. We also commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Mexico and Guatemala earlier in the third quarter and are planning to commence distribution in Colombia and Chile later in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we are also planning to commence distribution of Monster with the Coca-Cola bottlers in Brazil, Central America and Caribbean. We commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Albania, Iceland, Serbia and Macedonia in the second quarter and anticipate commencing distribution of Monster in Ukraine and Montenegro in the third quarter. We successfully transitioned Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers in South Africa in July and commenced distribution of Monster with additional Coca-Cola bottlers in Africa in the second quarter. Over the third quarter, we are planning to launch Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in eight additional African countries, with a number of additional countries in Africa, mainly in North Africa, to follow in the fourth quarter. We are making good progress in Nigeria with regard to both product registration and co-packing arrangements, which involves the installation of new equipment specifically designed for the production of Monster. We are targeting the fourth quarter for the launch of Monster in Nigeria. We've also completed the registration of our products in Turkey and many other Middle Eastern countries and are proceeding with the launch of Monster through Coca-Cola bottlers in Turkey and a number of Middle Eastern countries in the third and fourth quarters, as well as a number of other countries in the fourth quarter of 2016. In the second quarter, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. We are proceeding with the launch of Monster through Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of Central Asian countries in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our plans to launch Monster within the Coca-Cola system in China are continuing to progress well and we are currently engaged in the completion of our marketing and promotional plans in connection with the launch. Although we have reached an advanced stage of negotiations, we have still not reached final agreement with certain of the Coca-Cola bottlers in China. Subject to agreement on the outstanding terms, we are on schedule to launch Monster in China, commencing with certain key areas on a progressive basis at the end of the third quarter and/or early in the fourth quarter. We are currently awaiting approval for our product in India. We are making good progress in the repositioning, repackaging and reformulation of many of the Coca-Cola energy brands that we acquired as a result of the Coca-Cola transaction. As previously reported, we successfully completed our acquisition of the concentrated flavor business operated by AFF on April 1, 2016. While the acquisition and ongoing business activities of AFF have been in accordance with expectations, we did not account for the full benefits of the transaction during the quarter as previously discussed. Had we been able to account for the full benefits of the acquisition in determining our cost of goods for the quarter, our cost of goods would have been reduced by approximately $24 million in the second quarter, resulting in a commensurate increase in our gross profit, less a minimal reduction that was recorded in the quarter. We believe that from the third quarter onwards, we will be able to utilize the full benefits of the lower cost of goods for AFF flavors. The company commenced a tender offer in May to purchase up to $2 billion in value of its common stock through a modified Dutch auction tender offer. The tender offer resulted in the company's purchase of approximately 12.8 million shares at a price of $156 per share. The company accepted tendered shares on June 15, 2016 and as a result, was unable to obtain the full benefit of the reduction in its weighted average basic and diluted share capital for the full quarter. Had the repurchase been in effect for the full quarter, the repurchase would've increased net income per share on our basic and diluted share capital by approximately $0.05 per share for the quarter. On August 2, 2016 the company's board of directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $250 million of the company's outstanding common stock. There are limited sales of finished products in the strategic brands acquired from Coca-Cola. As a result, we have decided to rename our segments to address the products sold in those segments. Our ensuing discussion compares our 2016 second quarter results with our 2015 second quarter results after adjustments for certain items in both quarters previously described, namely acceleration of deferred revenue, distributed termination costs, expenses related to, one, the TCCC (12:40) transaction, two, the AFF transaction and three, the share repurchase, as well as the gain on the sale of Monster's non-energy business. These adjustments are set out in the table in our earnings release and may be helpful to participants to refer to. I would like to point out that such adjustments exclude any effects relating to, A, the manner of accounting pursuant to the AFF transaction in the quarter as opposed to future quarters, and B, the increased number of shares in the quarter due to the timing of the modified Dutch auction tender offer. In the second quarter, the company achieved record gross sales of $940.9 million, up 19.1% from $789.9 million in the second quarter of 2015. Net sales were $822.5 million, up 18.6% from $693.7 million in the second quarter of 2015. Net sales in the second quarter were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $4.1 million. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 62.4% as compared to 56.9% for the comparable 2015 second quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the Strategic Brands segment, which generally has higher gross margins than the Monster Energy Drinks segment; two, no sales in the three months ended June 30, 2016 of the brands disposed of as a result of the TCCC (14:14) transaction on June 12, 2015, previously comprised of the majority of the former warehouse segment in the Peace Tea brand, which generally had lower gross margins than the Monster Energy Drinks segment; three, lower costs of certain raw materials; and four, the price increase for our 16-ounce Monster product which was implemented at the end of August 2015. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.2%, as compared to 4.1% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.3% compared to 10.4% in the same quarter a year ago. Commission to Coca-Cola and increased sponsorship and endorsement costs largely related to the strategic brands were the two principal reasons for the increase in selling expenses. Premiums were also higher in the quarter. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 9.7% as compared to 9.5% in the same quarter last year. Payroll expenses were up $5.1 million, primarily to support the strategic brands that we acquired from Coca-Cola, and stock-based compensation on a non-cash item was $3 million higher, but was partially offset by a reduction in payroll taxes of $3.4 million. Distributor termination costs were $25.3 million in the second quarter, as compared to $12.2 million in the 2015 second quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's product were $3.8 million in the 2016 second quarter, as compared to $3.5 million in the 2015 second quarter. Our effective tax rate in the quarter decreased from an adjusted 37% in the 2015 second quarter to 35.3% in the 2016 second quarter, primarily due to the domestic production deduction. On an ongoing basis, we expect that our normalized tax rate will be approximately 36%. Net income was $203 million in the 2016 second quarter compared to net income of $143.2 million in the 2015 second quarter, after taking into account the adjustments previously discussed, an increase of 41.7%. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $200.2 million in the 2016 second quarter compared to $151.3 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. Net sales to customers outside the United States were higher in local currencies by approximately $4.1 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through July 23, 2016, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 4.3% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 7.2% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS decreased 0.4%, sales of Full Throttle decreased 8.8%, sales of Red Bull increased 2.3%, sales of Rockstar increased 10.5%, sales of 5-Hour decreased 3.4% and sales of AMP decreased 25.8%. According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended July 23, 2016, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increased 2.5% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 5.9% over the same period last year, while NOS was down 5.2% and Full Throttle sales decreased 7%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 0.3%, Rockstar was up 7%, 5-Hour was down 2.7% and AMP was down 34.1%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended July 23, 2016 Monster market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increased by 1.1 points over the same period last year to 35.3%. NOS' share decreased 0.3 points to 3.5% and Full Throttle's share decreased 0.1 point to 0.9%. Red Bull share decreased 0.8 points to 35.5%. Rockstar share was up 0.3 of a point to 7.9%. 5-Hour share was lower by 0.4 of a point to at 8.2% and AMP share decreased 0.8 of a point to 1.4%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended July 23, 2016 sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 20% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 14.2% higher than in the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy were 28.9% higher. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended June 25, 2016, the energy drink category decreased 4%. Monster sales decreased 2% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 4 share points to 28.2%, Red Bull sales decreased 3% and its market share increased 0.4 points to 38.6%, Rockstar sales decreased 8% and its market share decreased 0.6 points to 18.6%. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 36.4% during the month of June, Monster sales increased 4.2%, our market share decreased 7.6 points to 24.5% against the comparable period last year, sales of Burn, one of our acquired strategic brands increased 1.8%, although Burn's market share decreased 1.7 points to 4.9%. Red Bull sales decreased 14.9% and its market share decreased by 7.9 points to 13.1%. Vive 100's market share increased 20.2 points to 41.8%, while Boost's market share decreased 4 points to 10%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended June 2016, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 12.3% to 13.8% in Great Britain, from 18.7% to 22.7% in France, from 11.4% to 14.5% in Germany, from 21.6% to 24.8% in Spain, from 8.9% to 10.3% in Belgium, from 8.6% to 10.5% in Sweden, from 5.9% to 10.7% in Norway, from 9.7% to 11.7% in the Czech Republic and from 6% to 7.4% in the Netherlands. According to IRI, Monster's market share in Greece increased for the 13 weeks prior to the period ended June 2016 from 27.2% to 27.4%. For the 13-week period ended May 2016 according to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share in Ireland grew from 8.2% to 9.6%. Monster's retail market share in value decreased, however, from 16.7% to 13% in South Africa. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. We also note that South Africa was one of the markets that transitioned to the Coca-Cola bottlers at the beginning of July. According to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share in value in Chile increased to 22% in May 2016 compared to 15.6% last year and Monster's market share in Brazil declined from 3.9% to 2.5% in June 2016, as compared to the same period last year. In South Korea, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 10.8% to 22.3% in June, compared to the same period last year, and according to INTAGE, Monster's market share in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 32.7% to 39.2% in June of 2016. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the second quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $2.6 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the second quarter of 2016 increased 13.4% from $651.2 million to $738.5 million from the comparable period last year after the adjustments described above. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment were negatively impacted by approximately $1.5 million of foreign currency movement in the quarter. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $77.4 million for the second quarter, as compared to $13 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales in EMEA in the second quarter of 2016 in dollars were 33% higher than in the same period last year. In local currency, net sales in the region were 30% higher than the same period last year. Gross sales were 31% higher in dollars and 27% higher in local currencies. Gross profit in this region, as a percentage of net sales, increased from 46.4% in the same period last year to 50.8% during the 2016 second quarter. EMEA sales continued to be negatively impacted during the quarter by supply disruptions encountered by CCE in Great Britain, Monster's largest market in EMEA, during the first quarter that partially carried over to the second quarter, following the implementation of new software. Monster's continuing to gain momentum and increased market share in Europe. In particular, in Germany, France, Spain, Great Britain, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands, Monster achieved sales gains and continued to increase its market share. However, growth in South Africa was negatively impacted due to anticipated transition to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took effect from July 4, 2016. We are pleased with the launch of the Monster Ultra line in the EMEA region, which is now available in 19 European countries and was launched in South Africa in July. We anticipate that the Ultra line will be sold in almost all of our Western European markets by the end of this year. In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the second quarter increased 69.8% in dollars and 64.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 30.9% in the same period last year to 46.1% during the 2016 second quarter. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 20.1% or 10.3% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. We continue to experience strong performance in Japan. In South Korea, net sales increased 170% or 188.8% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year. In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Guam, net sales increased 330% or 339.7% in local currencies, as compared to the same quarter last year. And in Singapore, net sales increased 81% or 83.7% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with the planning for local production in India with a view to reentering the market later in 2016. In Latin America, which includes Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the second quarter increased 0.6% in dollars and increased 9.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 46.2% in the same period last year to 50% during the 2016 second quarter. Net sales decreased in Brazil, largely due to the overall difficult economic and market conditions, together with the ongoing uncertainties for our distributor relating to the Coca-Cola transaction and the anticipated transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which is now being set for November 1. In Mexico, net sales decreased in part due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, customer inventory destocking and the uncertainty relating to the Coca-Cola transition. However, as reported by Nielsen, Monster's sales at retail in Mexico grew in the quarter. In Chile, net sales in the quarter increased 2.1% in dollars or 11.2% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year. As mentioned earlier, we are optimistic that we will be able to finalize agreements with Coca-Cola bottlers in numerous countries in the near future. We are also continuing to evaluate production opportunities with Coca-Cola bottlers, both in the U.S. and internationally, which we believe will yield cost reductions. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $434.8 million at June 30, 2016 compared to $2.18 billion at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments were $44.3 million compared to $744.6 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term investments decreased $0 million from $15.3 million at December 31, 2015. Accounts receivable increased to $465.7 million at June 30, 2016 from $353 million at December 31, 2015. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 44.9 days at June 30, 2016 compared to 43.2 days at December 31, 2015 and 42.6 days at June 30, 2015. Inventories increased to $174.4 million from $156.1 million at December 31, 2015. Average days of inventory was 50.7 days at June 30, 2016, which was lower than the 58 days of inventory at December 31, 2015 and the 54.4 days at June 30, 2015. As announced at our annual shareholder meeting, we are continuing with our plans to launch Mutant, an exciting new beverage that will be positioned as refreshment energized late in September 2016. As previously announced, we also have additional new products planned for production later this year, and are working on additional new products that we are planning to introduce early in 2017. We estimate July 2016 gross sales on a foreign-exchange adjusted basis to be approximately 2% higher than in July 2015. In this regard, we point out that, one, in the U.S. and several countries, we had two less selling days this year compared to last year, a reduction of 10% in selling days, which will be recognized in August. Two, according to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended July 23, 2016 for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 3.8% versus the same period a year ago, while sales of Monster grew 7.5% in the same period versus a year ago. Three, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, such as the upcoming Call of Duty promotion, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. And four, for the reasons and factors just discussed, we reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, our acquisition of AFF is exciting and represents an important milestone for the company through the ownership of the proprietary formulas for our principal products. We believe that we'll be able to utilize the full benefits of the transaction through a reduction in operating costs commencing with the third quarter, and that this transaction will be accretive to the company's earnings. Two, North American and international gross margins remain healthy and continue to improve. Three, the U.S. Nielsen market statistics and equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. Four, the new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company's sales. Five, we're excited about the prospects for our new Mutant beverage, which we are planning to launch late in the third quarter. Six, we are particularly pleased with our performance in our international markets. And seven, finally, we have successfully transitioned additional international countries to Coca-Cola bottlers, and we have reached an advanced stage to transition many more markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in the second half of 2016. I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Our first question is from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Hi, everyone.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: Hi, Judy.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So first question is just looking at the U.S. trend. I guess the gross sales number in July, I know you called out the less shipping day issue, but just broadly, it seems like maybe trends are a little bit softer in the measured channel data. So first, what do you think is driving that? Secondly, how much is the non-measured, the non-traditional channel, really adding to the growth, because it looks like the second quarter U.S. number for your DSD business actually came in pretty healthy. And then my second question is just on Latin America. It sounds like you're making progress with the bottlers there in Mexico and Brazil, and just trying to get a sense of, is this more of a staged transition, where you're going into certain regions within that country with one bottle and then you roll out to other bottlers? Or how much of this could really have an impact in the more near-term? Thanks.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: We got to get you to start asking single questions, because our memory is not good enough to have all six of them all answered.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: It's really two.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Two, but the two gets subdivided into categories. I'm not quite sure how many they are. But okay. Just going back to what, I think, everybody has noticed that there's been a slight decline in the monthly or 4-week or 13-week numbers coming out of Nielsen for the category. And you saw that in the numbers, as we indicated earlier now, and I think, Judy, you published numbers over the past couple of months as well, and it showed there has been a decline. Monster has grown ahead – is growing ahead of the category, which I think is the important news, and we're continuing to take share, and that's in all the major channels. What has been quite interesting is that part of our growth has been coming from the other major channels, traditionally or historically, we sort of grew more in the convenience channel, and we're now starting to grow – we were underrepresented in grocery and drug and some of the other independent channels, and we are starting to pick up higher growth in those channels. So if you look at our Nielsen numbers for convenience and then you look at all measured, we're actually growing more in all measured than the convenience. We still believe that the trends are healthy for Monster. If we look at the gross sales, the key product in the gross sales, Monster Green, is still continuing to be positive. We are getting good traction in the Ultra line in the U.S. and internationally, as I indicated earlier in the call in Europe. And then generally, we are getting growth again in lines that had sort of leveled off a little bit like Rehab and the juice lines, they're both in growth again. And obviously what's quite exciting is the Java line; in fact, in the last 4 weeks, the Java line generally is up at a higher growth rate than it has been reported and has been sort of in the last quarter. So that's where we see the numbers. Obviously, the non-measured channels are also growing. Wal-Mart has been – is a big – an important customer for us, and those channels are growing. And that's why even in relation to July, I did want to mention that we looked at the all measured channels for the 4 weeks because that continues to grow at 7.5%.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: Judy, there's two points I would like to make. Firstly, the benefit of the Coca-Cola transaction is, in fact, in the drug and retail channels, as well as in the non-measured channels, and we are making significant progress with the Coca-Cola organization in the non-measured channel.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Then, Judy, just going to your second question.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: Which one of the two questions – the two remaining questions do you want answered first, Judy?
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: (38:07)
Operator: Pardon me, Judy.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hello?
Operator: Yes. Your line is open.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Sorry. Can you hear me now? I think I was cut off from the queue. I think I'm still mute. Oh, am I on? Okay, because I can't hear. Anyway, I was trying to just get a better sense of your Latin America transition and whether you're transitioning to one bottler at different stages or is this just more of a broader rollout into Mexico and Brazil from a transition standpoint? I can't hear anything. Can you hear?
Operator: Pardon me. I'm still on. I think we're having technical difficulties. Wait one second, ladies and gentlemen. Please stand by.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hello? Rodney? Hilton? Can you hear me? I don't understand. All right. We can't hear you, Rodney and Hilton. I think people could hear me.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by. Your conference will resume momentarily. Again, please stand by. Your conference will resume momentarily. Again, ladies and gentlemen, please stand by, your conference will resume momentarily. Again, please stand by, your conference will resume momentarily. Speakers have rejoined and you still have Judy Hong is still on.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you. Judy, can you hear us?
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I can hear you now. Thank you.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: (41:28)
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes, and I apologize for my two questions and then...
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Sorry, we just get focused on one, and then we just lose track of the other one. What was the other question we were still – you wanted to ask me?
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: It was related to Latin America. You talked about transitioning in Mexico and Brazil and I just wanted to get some color on whether this is one bottler you're transitioned or is this the broader country in both...?
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No, that's fine. What was happening was you have FEMSA that has a lot of areas in which they have operations. And even though they're in different countries, they don't necessarily fill up (42:04) the whole country. So ultimately, we spent a lot of time ultimately in negotiating and getting to a deal with FEMSA. Once we're done there, it didn't facilitated moving quite quickly with other bottlers in each of these different countries. So as we indicated in the call, we have transitioned the whole of Mexico to all of the bottlers that comprised the Coca-Cola group in Mexico, and that has already started as of last week. In the case of the planned transition in Brazil, it will be to all of the bottlers at the same time. The whole group of bottlers have signed agreements with us. We're waiting until that all has happened at one time, and we will transition the whole country on November 1. In the case of Chile, there are two bottlers, we are going to the whole country. In the case of Brazil – sorry, Colombia, there may be some small areas, but really it pretty much is FEMSA. We've already transitioned Peru, and we will be transitioning the other countries. So it will be pretty much the whole area. We will also be starting Central America and going to countries at a time in the Caribbean. We will be making that quite extensively, and that's not the same, for example, in which I indicated in China, where we are looking at – at the three main bottlers, but we are looking at that as such a big country, we're looking at selected areas and selected operating units first to go into then to launch in the second area with the second bottler, then in the third area, which are large towns, for example, we are looking at focusing in Beijing, in Shanghai and in Guangzhou, those areas, and then launching and then going to rolling it out to the different BU, operating units as we go forward.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: And let's not forget about OXXO and how important OXXO is in Latin America as well.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yes, and so we have come to – that was part of the arrangements that we know you spent time negotiating with those two – with FEMSA and all of the two principal bottlers. That is correct, and so that is a more extensive rollout over the next – coming months in Latin America.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Evan Morris of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Evan Morris - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good evening, everyone.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good evening.
Evan Morris - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just on the Mutant launch, you talked about being in advanced stages. If you could just talk a little bit about the sort of the planned size of the rollout, just the channels. Is it just going to be focused on C-stores initially or other channels as well? And then just – it would be helpful is just if you've launched other kind of new platforms, not necessarily flavor extensions, but new platforms like this, how additive has it been to your sales growth in let's say the first 12 months to 18 months?
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I think that each country is unique. Where we've been in countries, and we've transitioned, you obviously are going into all channels. Where you run into smaller countries, particularly where you got a bottler with good connections with some of the measured channels of the modern trade, you are going to the independent stores and the modern trade and grocery at the same time. Other markets, we just generally try and focus first on the down the street and the independent markets and then go into the market. So you can't – there's no single formula for all of these markets. There isn't even a single formula for which markets you're going into. These are being done on opportunistically on the basis that when we are able to conclude agreements with the Coke bottlers, when we're able to properly terminate on due notice to our existing bottlers if there are bottlers in those markets and – we will then go into markets. I mean, you take Argentina, there we haven't gone into the market – in that market, we are at the moment engaged in planning production and looking at the changes being made to the line in order to accommodate our product. And then once that's done, we are working through the value chains with the local Coke bottlers in Argentina, then hopefully, we will come to an agreement with them and then plan a launch. So that takes a much longer time, and it's a longer planning process than in other countries. So every country is different and while we expect countries A, B and C to be the third quarter, and D, E and F to be the fourth quarter, you may end up with A, B and D in the third quarter and C, E and F in the fourth quarter. So it changes literally from month-to-month. So I can't give you a set plan of this on how it's coming in. And again, as to the contribution, it changes differently. Some markets the bottlers are – get more instant distribution and our sales are at a higher rate. Some markets, it takes time for the bottlers to get to understand our brand, the velocity. It has a different velocity to traditional beverages; it doesn't start off at a high velocity in what would be the normal or ordinary high-volume accounts. It needs to be bought in the smaller stores where it's served cold and sold cold, one can at a time. And so sometimes that takes a lot of getting used to by the bottlers and it takes time. So there is no magical ramp-up the day you start that you have a magical set of things. It just takes time and builds and continues to build. So we're at the stage where we really are transitioning a lot of markets now and there are different stages, and we have been for some months, and these are going to continue to build over the rest of this year and in 2017.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: Yes. And what I would say is, while we don't give guidance, I think, you can look at some markets that have been transitioned. We spoke, for example, on the call about Germany, which was transitioned last year. We spoke about South Korea, and you can look at some of those markets. I'm not saying that's indicative of all markets going forward, but certainly there's been a lot of progress with some of the Coca-Cola bottlers internationally. And we do expect good – that's why the transaction was done, we expect good performance from those bottlers as we go forward.
Evan Morris - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yeah. I agree. Thank you.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Your line is open.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Hey. Good afternoon, guys.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Mark.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So, two questions. One, quickly, just why was concentrate or the strategic brands, Coke brands, whatever you're calling it these days, why was that better? And is that sort of a good run rate to use on a go-forward basis? And then second question, not to confuse you, but I think it's fairly straightforward. So on China, beyond negotiations with Coke bottlers, is there anything else that prevents you from commencing distribution? Like is there any formula or manufacturing approvals that are still needed?
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Let me deal with the China first. In the case of China, we already have product approvals, and we have manufacturing approvals, with two of the three bottlers. With the third bottler, we have product approval and we're pretty much, I think, we're almost through with the product, I don't think we've actually seen it, but I think it should be imminent, and then we'll go through the manufacturing approval process. We don't see any problem with that. It's already been approved by two independent Chinese authorities or provinces and that should be fine. And even if there were some technical hiccups, we could supply product from the Shanghai area, for example, to one of the other areas, and produce it there. So those shouldn't be issues. We just – obviously, we are in the planning stages. We're just trying to get to the finish line on a couple of issues, on the value chains and the sharing and basically just some contractual terms. We think we should be, be there. It started off with a very big laundry list and we're down to a very few items now. So, we're quite comfortable that we will get there. On the strategic brands, on the run rate, you didn't have a full quarter last year, whereas you did have the full quarter this year. The full quarter...
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: (50:35) only completed on June 15, 2015, so you're comparing that to a full quarter in 2016.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Right. And so basically, I think, if you take the – what you will get in the 10-Q, you'll get the breakout in the sectors, and you will get – which will now be called the strategic brand sector, you will get the numbers in that sector, which will give you, we think, to be – which will be indicative of future quarters and the run rate. But again, subject to seasonality, et cetera. But that will be more in line as we go forward. There is a little bit of finished product in sales in that sector, which it doesn't – it really doesn't affect it very much. It's a little bit of noise. If that starts growing a little more, it obviously may have a bit more of the effect, for example, and the reason we are saying that, and pulling it out, and that's why we're putting it into the different sector. For example, in the case of NOS in the U.S., we converted the 22-ounce plastic bottle, sort of that unique NOS bottle, but wasn't really practical to have produced and shipped and on shelves, and we converted that and changed it into our 24-ounce resealable can. So we re-launched the 24-ounce resealable can. It is a good product and it's doing nicely. But that product, the Coca-Cola bottlers who are manufacturing NOS off a concentrate model do not have the ability to manufacture the 24-ounce cap-can. So we are having it manufactured and supplied on a finished product basis. So again, there are some anomalies like this, there is a little bit of finished products in Germany on strategic products, because we changed Relentless into a 355-ml slim can. And again, the Coke production plant that was producing Relentless in a 500-ml can before we made the change to the design to the packaging and the pack size, didn't have either the capacity or the ability, I'm not sure which, but – to do so, so we are producing it at one of our co-packers and selling finished product. So that might have an effect on your sale proceeds and slightly smaller margins, because of just the nature of selling concentrate at a higher margin. But we think at the moment that is not a meaningful number in that sector.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Thanks, guys. Good evening.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Evening. Hi, Kevin.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Hi. So a quick clarification on the July sales update. That was selling-day adjusted, correct – or was not selling day adjusted for two days, so...
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: It's wasn't. That's our actual estimate, and we are saying that, we actually had 10% less selling days. I mean, that's why we made that point, yes.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: So it's something closer to like high-single digits. Is that fair? On a selling day adjusted basis?
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: We're not going to extrapolate, but we think that, obviously, that does happen, I mean, if you're selling, you're selling, and you just don't have those deliveries. So, it's a delivery up and that's why we again pointed to the fact that the retail sale numbers going out of the store is up substantially higher than, for example, our sales are showing. And that's why we really are cautious because this single month is a very, very difficult month to start trying to look at and look at trends and this happens to be one of those months where we looked – we can all see the number and say, okay, but you look at these other factors, and we just don't feel there's any significance to it. But that's how we read, and we run the business more on a trend basis than a single period of time.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Understood. Thanks for the clarification there. And Hilton, another point of clarity; on the gross margin, if I understood you correctly, you had an unfavorable impact of $24 million on cost of goods, so the top line was very strong in the quarter, I guess, relative to expectations. The margins came in a bit lower than consensus expectations, but is it fair to say that the gross margin would have been closer to about 66% on a pro forma basis, adjusting for that? And number one, is that fair? And number two, is that sort of a reasonable expectation going forward here?
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: Okay, firstly, we don't give guidance. So, I'm not going to comment on gross margins going forward. What I can tell you is that, in the quarter, because of the accounting and for the consolidation of AFF, we did not get the benefit of the lower cost of goods in this quarter because we had the inventory, and they had the inventory and everything was related to fair value adjustment. So we did not get the benefit of the, A, lower cost of sales in this quarter. We will get it in subsequent quarters. If you look at what that number should have been had we not had to account for – on these fair value adjustment methods, we would've added $24 million to our gross profit. And whatever that percentage is, that's what the percentage is.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Very good. All right, that's helpful. Just one more for me, if I could come back to Mutant and Hydro. Hilton, can you talk a little bit about the receptivity from retailers, particularly in the convenience channel, which is what you're targeting at this point? And a little bit on your level of confidence that you're going to get the type of merchandising and shelving that you want. And that is sort of at a different point in the cooler from the existing portfolio. Just sort of minimize cannibalization there. And then also maybe if you could just give us a little bit of clarity on the Hydro launch and when you anticipate that hitting. Thank you very much for your time.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: So sales teams have been not making calls on Mutant, and many of the retailers, many of the major retailers, and in general, the reception has been good. I'm not sure that of any negatives that have been portrayed so far. We have very specific merchandising objectives for this product. It's not going to compromise our space or the Coca-Cola space. So we've very specific merchandising objectives, and all I can say, and I don't want to say too much, but the launch is proceeding in accordance with plan, and the communication with the retailers is also proceeding in accordance with plan. We have not had any negatives to speak of.
Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC: Yeah. Okay. Thank you.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: All right, then of the Hydro side, we are dealing with the planning on that product, but we really focusing on getting Mutant down into the market and doing that and we have our sales team and obviously the Coke bottlers have theirs, so you want to focus on one thing at a time. We do propose to follow with Hydro launch. We think that may still be – we're anticipating in the fourth quarter. Again, it may be subject to getting the cooperation and the ability of the bottlers to focus when they get to that holiday season that does become a bit tight. But subject to that, we should be able to get Hydro after, again, later in the fourth quarter. And then we do have one or two additional product – innovation product lines, one particular one planned for launch towards the end of the year, beginning of next year. But again, depending on simply timing, we may get the products done and shipped at the end of year, but probably will be fully launched in January or late January. So there is the sort of the innovation pipeline going forward. There are a number of individual items that we are still also looking at introducing in this period in the next couple of months – next six months.
Operator: Thank you. This ends the Q&A portion of today's conference. I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you. On behalf of the company, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy, and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company, both at home and abroad, and in particular, to expand distribution of our product through the Coca-Cola bottler system internationally. We are particularly excited about the new opportunities that we have going forward, with a robust portfolio of energy drink product throughout the world, comprised of our Monster Energy brand, together with the strategic brands, as well as for our new Mutant product line. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

===== 2016 Q1  (2016-04-29 11:00:00) =====
Executives: Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman and CEO Hilton H. Schlosberg - VC, President, COO, CFO and Secretary
Analysts: Kevin Grundy - Jefferies Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel William B. Chappell - SunTrust John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Caroline Levy - CLSA
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Corporation’s First Quarter 2016 Financial Results. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference to Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. You may begin.
Rodney Cyril Sacks : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for attending this call. I’m Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, Vice Chairman and President, is with me today, as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I’d like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management, with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance, and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities & Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed February 29, 2016 including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated April 29, 2016. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. At the outset I should mention that the release of our quarterly results and this call are almost a week earlier than normally scheduled. The reason for this change is that Hilton and I will be attending the Coca-Cola Global System Meeting that starts early next week. We will revert to our normal schedule for the second and subsequent quarters. We are continuing to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers worldwide. We have successfully concluded negotiations with Coca-Cola bottlers in many countries, and are planning to launch Monster with these bottlers in most of their international markets in the near future. As previously reported we have concluded agreements with Coca-Cola Amatil, which distributes Coca-Cola products in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Fiji. We will be launching Monster in Australia on May 1 and in New Zealand on May 9 with Coca-Cola Amatil. Additionally as previously reported we have concluded agreements with BTIG the 100% owned Coca-Cola bottler that operate in a number of international markets for the distribution of Monster in certain of these markets. Further to these agreements we are planning to launch Monster on May 13 in Singapore. Our plans to launch Monster in China are continuing to move forward with the Coca-Cola System. In Shanghai we have received the required product approval and manufacturing license and are planning for production of Monster there. In Beijing, we have received the required product approval and are awaiting the manufacturing license. We have commenced the required approval process in Xiamen in Southeast China. We are full planning to launch monster in China later this year, but as previously discussed the launch could be delayed by various factors including regulatory approvals and finalization of distribution agreements. We are targeting a relaunch of Monster in India later this year following discussions with their regulatory authorities. We continue to make good progress in our discussions with FEMSA, Arca and other bottler operating in South America. We have signed a distribution agreement with the Coca-Cola bottler with Lindley, which is controlled by Arca for distribution of Monster in Peru and are planning to launch the Monster in Peru on June 2nd. We are also planning to launch or transition a number of other international markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in the insuring quarters. We continue to make good progress in the repositioning, repackaging and reformulation of many of the Coca-Cola energy brands that were required as a result of the Coca-Cola transaction. We successfully completed our acquisition of the concentrate and flavor business operated by American Fruits and Flavors for $690 million in cash on April 1, 2016. We remain excited by this acquisition, which aligns us with our principal flavor supplier and will enable us to expand and secure most of our flavors at an economical cost. The integration of the acquired business is proceeding well. Consistent with the company’s previously announced plan to return capital to shareholders in 2016, the company currently intend to commence a tender offer in May to purchase up to $2 billion in value of its common stock through a modified Dutch auction tender offer at a price range to be specified. The company will fund the tender offer with cash on hand. In the first quarter sales in the beverage industry in general and of carbonated beverages in particular continue to show weakness. However, sales of Monster product accelerated during the quarter. In the first quarter of 2015 in anticipation of the closing of the Coca-Cola transaction we transitioned approximately 84% of the targeted distribution rights in the U.S. to the Coca-Cola System. With an additional 5% transitioned in May 2015. Consequently the results of the comfortable first quarter of 2015 were impacted by the acceleration of deferred revenue of $39.8 million, distribution termination cost of $206 million and Coca-Cola transaction cost to $3.6 million. Our ensuring discussion compares our 2016 first quarter results with our 2015 first quarter results after adjustment for the acceleration of deferred revenue, distribution termination process and Coca-Cola transaction costs referred to about. In the first quarter the company achieved gross record sales of $777.5 million, up 16% from $670.4 million in the first quarter of 2015. Net sales were $680.2 million, up 15.9% from $587 million in the first quarter of 2015. Net sales in the first quarter were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately 12.3 million. Our original green energy drink Monster Energy Drink continues to perform well at retail. Retail sales of the Ultra line continue to show good growth in the United States during the first quarter, as did our Java Monster line.  Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 62.2%, as compared to 56.1% for the comparable 2015 first quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to increased net sales of the Concentrate segment, which has higher gross margins than the Finished Products segment, the disposal of our non-energy brands, and the price increase on our 16-ounce Monster Energy drinks effective August 31, 2015. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.4%, as compared to 4.4% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.2% compared to 10.6% in the same quarter a year ago. Sponsorship and endorsement costs, merchandise display costs, and social media expenses were all higher in the first quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2015, while commissions were lower. General and administrative costs excluding distributor terminations costs and Coca-Cola transaction cost as a percentage of net sales for the 2016 first quarter were 10.6% as compared to 10.8% for the corresponding quarter in 2015. Payroll expenses were up $1.5 million consisting of $5 million increase in payroll due partially to increased staffing in connection with our acquisition of the strategic brands and an increase in stock-based compensation, a non-cash item of $3.7 million, which were offset by a reduction of payroll taxes of $7.2 million following the exercise of certain stock options in the first quarter of 2015. Also including general and administrative costs is amortization of trademarks a non-cash item of $1.8 million attributable to our acquisition of the strategic brands.  Distributor termination costs were $3.4 million in the first quarter as compared to $206 million in the 2015 first quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company’s products were $5.4 million in the 2016 first quarter as compared to $4.9 million in the 2015 first quarter. In addition, other legal costs were $2.4 million higher for the 2016 first quarter. Our effective tax rate decreased from an adjusted 38% to 35.8% in the first quarter primarily due to the domestic production deduction. On an ongoing basis, we expect that our normalized tax rate will be approximately 36%. Net income was $166.1 million, compared to net income of $110.8 million during the first quarter of last year, an increase of 49.9%. However, despite the substantial increase in the number of shares on a fully diluted basis from $173.8 million to $206.9 million following the issuance of shares to Coca-Cola, diluted earnings per share increased to $0.80 after adjusting for distributor termination expense for the first quarter from $0.64 in the 2015 comparable quarter. Gross sales to customers outside the United States were $184.4 million in the 2016 first quarter compared to $141 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $149.1 million in the 2016 first quarter compared to $113 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. As stated earlier, gross sales and net sales to customers outside of the United States were higher in local currencies by approximately $15.1 million and $12.3 million respectively, including geographic sales reported are our sales to the company’s military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through March 2016 all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including energy shots increased by 7.1% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 10.8% in the 13 week period, while sales of NOS increased 2.5%, and sales of Full Throttle decreased 9%. Sales of Red Bull increased 4.1%, sales of Rockstar increased by 14.2%, sales of 5-hour decreased 0.1%, and sales of AMP decreased 8.1%. According to Nielsen for the five weeks ended March 26, 2016, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars increased 5.9% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 9.6% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 5.4% and Full Throttle sales decreased 5%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 1.3%, Rockstar was up 12.6%, 5-hour was up 1.9%, and AMP was down 4.5%. According to Nielsen for the five weeks ended March 2016, Monster’s market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel including energy shots in dollars increased by 1.2 points over the same period last year to 35.2%. NOS' share remains the same at 3.7% and Full Throttle share decreased 0.1 of a point to 1.1%. Red Bull share decreased 1.6 points to 35.1%, slightly below Monster share. Rockstar share was up 0.5 points at 7.9%. 5-hour share was lower by 0.3 points at 8.3% and AMP share decreased 0.2 points to 1.8%. According to Nielsen for the five weeks ended March 26, 2016, sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 20.6% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 18.4% higher than the same period last year, while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy was 25.2% higher. We’d like to mention there have been some changes in the dollar base we use to report on this category.  According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended March 05, 2016, the energy drink category decreased 2%. Monster sales were unchanged versus a year ago, our market share increased 0.3 share point to 27.8%, Red Bull sales decreased 1%, and its market share increased 0.7 points to 37.3%. Rockstar sales decreased 9%, and its market share decreased 1.2 points to 18%. According to Nielsen for all our outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 33.1% during the month of February 2016. Monster sales increased 8.3%, our market share decreased 5.7 points to 25% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn, one of our acquired strategic brands increased 4.9%, although Burn’s market share decreased 1.7 points to 6.5%. Red Bull sales increased 0.7 of a percent, and its market share decreased by 5.1 points to 15.7%. Vive 100’s market share increased 14.3 points to 34.9%, while Boost’s market share decreased 3.4 points to 11.3%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced, positively and/or negatively, by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in their chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.  According to Nielsen in the 13 week period ended March 2016, the actual 13 week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets, Monster’s retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 12.1% to 13% in Great Britain, from 9.3% to 11% in Sweden, from 8.4% to 9.7% in Belgium, from 6.5% to 9% in Norway, from 5.7% to 7% in the Netherlands and from 18.4% to 20.9% in France. For the 13 week period ended February 2016, according to Nielson Monster’s retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 11.1% to 13.6% in Germany and decreased from 17.5% to 16.4% in South Africa although value sales were 19.3% higher according to Nielsen. We note that South Africa is one of those markets that has not transitioned to Coca-Cola bottlers. Monster’s retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ending February 2016 in Ireland increased from 7.4% to 8.7% and from 21.5% to 24.8% in Spain. According IRI Monster’s market share in Greece decreased in the 13 weeks at the end of February 2016 from 29.3% to 29.1%.  I would like to point that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen for the month of March 2016 in Chile Monster’s retail market share in value increase to 20.4% as compared to 15.3% last year. And in Brazil Monster’s market share for the month of March 2016 declined from 4.7% to 3.1% as compared to the same period last year. In South Korea for the month of March 2016 Monster’s retail market share in value increased from 10% to 18.7% compared to the same period last year. According to INTAGE for the month of March 2016 in the convenience and store channel in Japan, Monster’s market share grew from 33.8% to 39.9%. Net sales for the Finished Products segment in the first quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $10.3 million of foreign currency movements in the first quarter. Net sales for the Finished Products segment in the first quarter of 2016 increased 12.3% from $555.7 million to $624.3 million from a comparable period last year after adjustments for acceleration of deferred revenue. Net sales for the company’s Concentrate segment were negatively impacted by approximately $2 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. After adjustment for such foreign currency movements net sales for the concentrated segment would have been $57.9 million for the first quarter. As a result of the Coca-Cola transaction, which closed on June 12, 2015 there were sales for the other segment during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $31.3 million of net sales in the first quarter of 2015. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the first quarter increased 47.2% in dollars and 58.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 39.4% in the same period last year to 50.2% during the 2016 first quarter. EMEA sales were negatively impacted by supply disruptions that were encountered by CCE in Great Britain Monster’s largest market in the EMEA during the quarter following the implementation of new software. Monster continue to gain momentum and increase market share in Europe in the first quarter. Overall EMEA is now operating well and we have made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and in-store execution, including securing distribution by Coca-Cola bottlers in new countries and territories within the region. We are pleased with the launch of Ultra in Europe. We commenced distribution of Ultra in an additional eight markets in EMEA in the first quarter. Ultra will be launched in 10 additional markets in EMEA in the second quarter of 2016. In particular in Germany, France, Denmark, Belgium, Hungary, Ireland, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Sweden Monster achieved increased sales gains as well as increased market share. In Asia-Pacific net sales in the first quarter increased 93.5% in dollars and 97.7% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 31.2% in the same period last year to 45.2% during the 2016 first quarter. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 63.4%, 62.5% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. We continue to experience strong performance in Japan. In South Korea net sales increased 283.4% or 312.6% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. In Mexico, Central America and South America net sales for the first quarter decreased 3.2% in dollars and increased 9.2% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 39.8% in the same period last year to 41.1% during the 2016 first quarter. Net sales decreased in Brazil largely due to the overall difficult economic and market conditions together with the ongoing uncertainties for our distributor relating to the Coca-Cola transaction. In Mexico net sales decreased impart due to customer destocking during the quarter and delivery disruptions during the month of March. However, as reported by Nielsen Monster sales at retail in Mexico grew during the quarter. In Chile net sales in the quarter increased 52.3% in dollars and 74.9% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year.  As previously mentioned we are moving ahead with planning for local production in India and anticipate reentering the market in India later in 2016. As mentioned earlier we are optimistic that we will be able to finalize agreements with Coca-Cola bottlers in numerous countries in the near future. We are also continuing to evaluate production opportunities for Coca-Cola bottlers both in the U.S. and internationally, which we believe will yield cost reductions. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $2.5 billion at March 31, 2016 prior to the close of the AAF conception compared to $2.2 billion at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments were $508.2 million compared to $744.6 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term investments decreased to $7.4 million from $15.3 million at December 31, 2015. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 48.7 days at March 31, 2016, and 43.2 days at December 31, 2015 compared to 46.4 days at March 31, 2015. Inventories increased to $165.9 million from $156.1 million at December 31, 2015. Average days of inventory was 58.1 days at March 31, 2016, which was higher than the 58 days of inventory at December 31, 2015 and lower than the 69.1 days at March 31, 2015.  During the 2016 first quarter, we launched our new Gronk energy drink and Salted Caramel Java Monster initial consumer response has been positive. We are planning to launch Mutant, an exciting new beverage that will be positioned as the refreshment energize in the third quarter of 2016. For competitive reasons we intend to provide further information on this new beverage at the stockholder meeting on June 14. As previously disclosed we also have additional new products plan for later this year. As this call is a week earlier than usual we can only provide the estimate for April 2016 gross sales. Based on gross sales through April 28, 2016 we estimated April 2016 gross sales in dollars will be approximately 15% higher than in April 2015. In local currencies we estimate April 2016 gross sales will be approximately 16% higher than in April 2015. We note that April 2015 sales included the old Warehouse segment and Peace Tea and April 2016 includes the Concentrate segment. We caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I’d like to summarize some recent positive points. Our acquisition of AAF is exciting and represents an important milestone for the company through the ownership of the proprietary formulas for our principal product. This transaction will be accretive to the company’s earnings from the closing of the transaction on April 1, 2016. Consistent with the company’s previously announced plan to return capital to shareholders in 2016 the company currently intends to commence a tender offer in May to purchase up to $2 billion in value of its common stock through a modified Dutch auction tender offer at price range to be specified.  The company will fund the tender offer with cash on hand, while Hilton and I may participate in the offer for asset diversification reasons we will continue to earn a substantial majority of our current holdings following any successful tender offer. North American and international gross margins remained healthy and continue to improve. The U.S. Nielsen market statistics and equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company’s sales. We are excited about the prospects for our new Mutant beverage, which we are planning to launch in the third quarter. We are particularly pleased with our performance in our international markets. We have successfully transitioned a number of international countries to Coca-Cola bottlers and we have reached an advanced stage to transition many more markets to Coca-Cola bottlers from the second quarter of 2016. I’d like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year please note that we will not be taking any questions with respect to the tender offer on this call. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is now open. 
Kevin Grundy: Thanks, good morning, guys. 
Rodney Cyril Sacks : Good morning. 
Kevin Grundy: I want to start with China given the importance of your launch in that market, can you talk a little bit about building upon the timing of that around the brand positioning, the investment that’s going to be required for trial there to raise brand awareness that would be helpful. Thank you. 
Rodney Cyril Sacks : To give most of the information that you are asking would be giving future estimates and indications and even more difficulty in a market that we are just going into. We are -- all I would like to say about China is that we are planning to enter China in a similar way to which we have entered other markets. We look at building distribution on a store-by-store basis, we are going into the market with one SKU which is Monster green primarily our main product. As I indicated in the call, we are still looking to finalize negotiations with our distribution partners on the distributions agreements and those negotiations have been taking -- have taken some time. We are progressing with registrations. So we are in a new country it’s -- we are looking at -- obviously we don’t have a lot of experience there because we’ve not been there. And so to say more than that I don’t know we are looking to continue later this year, but there could be some delays in getting the registrations, but we are continuing to focus on China and I just don’t believe that there is more at this point that we will be able to say. Obviously, we will need to make investments in the market, which we will do as appropriate to establish the brand, but it’s a slow traditional build for us going into China. 
Kevin Grundy: Can I ask a follow-up? 
Rodney Cyril Sacks : Yes. 
Kevin Grundy: Thank you. Just switching gears to the U.S. some of the Nielson data has slowed a bit broadly for the category and some of this may have been that we’ve cycled the pricing that Red Bull has taken and you want to cycle that into the fall, but can you talk a little bit about some of the slowing that we are seeing broadly in the category in the U.S. whether that’s concerning at all or whether you think it’s a bit of blip and then what is our expectations broadly for the category for the balance of the year? Thank you. 
Rodney Cyril Sacks : The category, might be seeing a slowing slightly, but obviously it’s still growing at a good positive rate, you have got to look at the category in the context of beverages generally, I think the point you made is one of the important points is that part of that category’s growth is that we are cycling on price increases now and if you look at the growth and it’s largely is influenced -- the category growth largely gets influenced by the growth that obviously Red Bull enough contribute to the category as the major participants in the country. And you have seen a slowing in the Red Bull numbers and that really has probably a large influence on that category. So we don’t see much difference, we are positive about the category, but obviously we can’t tell where the category will grow, what sort of innovation will come from our competitors, we have innovations as I have indicated coming. It is going to come later in the year, but we do have quite a robust innovation pipeline.
Operator: And our next question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. 
Judy Hong: Thank you, good morning. 
Rodney Cyril Sacks : Good morning, Judy.
Hilton H. Schlosberg: Good morning, Judy. 
Judy Hong: So broadly speaking it seems like your international sales growth has accelerated in Q1 versus Q4 and I was just hoping to get a little bit more color just in terms of how much is this really lapping some of the inventory issues that you have had and are we now mostly behind some of that issues? How much are you getting growth in some of the transition market and as you look over the next six months markets like Australia where you are transitioning to Amatil and then you got Nigeria and some of the newer markets you are entering just your expectation in terms of how quickly you can see growth accelerating just broadly from an international perspective?
Rodney Cyril Sacks: Again, like everything in life everybody would like things to happen instantaneously, but it takes time and as we transition we are starting to see once you have had an opportunity to settle down with the particular bottler in that market we all starting to see good progress. But again is also depends on the commitment of a bottler and each bottler has his own priorities, his own commitments and it is varied, but if you look at the trend Judy, which is clearly from what we have given the indication on each of the countries on our market share. The trend generally is continuing to be positive and we are continuing to take market share.
Hilton H. Schlosberg: I would say look at the German numbers Judy that we spoke about on the call and also South Korea. Those are two markets that have been transitioned to the Coca-Cola System. Those may give some indications but the other markets that we have not seen that amount of growth and those are some of the Hellenic markets. So as Rodney said it does differ from country to country. So those are two good indications here.
Rodney Cyril Sacks: So we just think generally it’s positive and as we go forward obviously we do look work our way through the choppiness and the transition issues that we had in the past.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question come from Mark Astrachan from Stifel. Your line is open.
Mark S. Astrachan: Hey, good morning, guys.
Rodney Cyril Sacks: Hi, Mark. Good morning.
Hilton H. Schlosberg: Good morning.
Mark S. Astrachan: I wanted to ask about the Concentrate business. So it still seems to be a little bit weaker I think than it was originally trending going into the deal close. I guess I’m curious if you were to try to parse it out sort of differently maybe there is some questions have been asked about it in the past. How much of the under performance has been driven by some of the larger brands like Relentless in particular, but also like Burn in terms of what has happened from relaunches, repositionings, potential reductions in shelf space in favorable Monster and the like. In other words is there a way to sort of think about it split up by the bigger brands and maybe even comment on some of those smaller brands that could be getting discontinued?
Hilton H. Schlosberg: I think it’s a mix bag. I actually have done full analysis of these strategic brand. Like you we also need to understand what the position is with regard to those brand. Some of it is relating to weakness in the brand themselves that we are addressing in various ways. Some of that of course is a foreign currency and there is another factor in that in certain countries we have been unable to structure ourselves in a way that we could actually self concentrate and what we do in certain countries is we get a royalty from the Coca-Cola Company, which equates to effectively what we would have done had we sell the Concentrate. The struction is sitting up various countries to accommodate the Concentrate business. So there is a whole lot of factors that one has to take into account in evaluating the Concentrate business. But largely there is some weakness, but you are not seeing in these numbers the full extent of the Concentrate business because of some of these adjustments that have to take place.
Rodney Cyril Sacks: I think that one other thing we did mentioned previously that we did find that in some of the cases the investment in the strategic brands prior to and during the transition had been trimmed and cut back and that did affect sale. So we did see a reduction in sales in those countries as a result we believe of that. So what we’ve had to do is not only just go in and blindly obviously reinvest in marketing, but we’ve had to relook at how we repositioning these brands and at the same time get the repositioning done both in repackaging, in designs, in flavors and then obviously then recreate marketing plans to fit those the new positioning that we have looked at four of these brands particularly the Burn brand and Relentless are two of the large brands that did have some weakness. We’ve also in many ways repositioned NOS a little bit in the U.S. although we haven’t changed packaging, we all are going to modernize that packaging and that’s still coming through now. So this is a long process because there were many brands in many countries and laid on top of our own staffing and our own business obviously at Monster it takes a long-term to get a lot of these reposition done. So we think that’s partially the reason for it and yes, it has been weaker than we had estimated but we are -- we have been doing the repositioning, we have doing some focusing, we are starting to see some strong signs and we do believe that that will continue to be positive. Some of the other brands although smaller again it’s a mix big you can’t put it into one category because in some cases the brands are smaller and may go away, but in other cases some of the smaller brands are very good, very strong brands and we are actually looking to long-term growth from those brands, but again it’s going to be a positioning and a build. It’s not going to happen overnight. But there are some really good brands that we see in the mix that we do believe we will see growth from going forward.
Hilton H. Schlosberg: Does that answer your question? So it’s a kind of mixture of volume decreases in certain brands that are being addressed and other factors that...
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Chappell from SunTrust. Your line is open. 
William B. Chappell: Thanks, good morning. Rodney can you talk a little bit about Mexico from kind of the numbers you were reeling off I couldn’t tell if they were just some short-term turbulence or can you give a little more color, what’s going on there?
Rodney Cyril Sacks : There were obviously some challenges in March as we indicated, that is a market that has not transitioned so there is obviously some uncertainty relating to the market. The market we have still grown just short of 10% and so the brand has continually grown quarter-to-quarter, but there is the emergence of a low cost brand Vive 100 in the market that have been very aggressive and they have really expanded the market and that’s why when we look at the market we say our market share has decreased, but is it of a very much increased market and may be a little bit different. And then we had a debate earlier as to does Vive 100 really put into category or do well we really in the premium category and Vive 100 is in a lower price category are they really different and should we be splitting them. And as we think we have traditionally put them into the one category, but that really what’s happens. So if you look at the underlying market bearing the uncertainties et cetera it is still growing and obviously one of the issues is ForEx and affordability, but we are still growing. So we are comfortable with end market, we think it’s a good market and we think that in the future we will continue to see pretty good growth from there.
Hilton H. Schlosberg: So since you like numbers, let me quote the number enough for Vive 100, there 340 ml PET which is their leading product in pesos sells for 10 pesos. Our product, a 473ml U.S. product that sold in Mexico sells for 30 pesos to 32 pesos. So that’s the comparison in pricing. It’s a very, very aggressive competitor and we don’t want to go down and we will not go down to that type of pricing for Monster. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from John Faucher with JP Morgan. Your line is open. 
John A. Faucher: Thank you. Just want to follow-up on the last couple of questions. You’ve talked about sort of preaching patients in terms of getting these bottler deals done totally understand that. Can you tell us what goes into the negotiations, it sounds like some of these sort of brand shifts what the underlying support levels are the transition may be out of some of the Coke Concentrate brands into the Monster brand and how you manage that transition? It sounds like that’s part of the negotiations and so is that why this is taking longer? And so I guess sort of a little bit of color in terms of kind of what you need to nail down with the bottlers as you do these deals? Thanks.
Rodney Cyril Sacks :  I think you put into two different buckets, the one bucket is although we are trying to get us have ourselves the hope further that we will become more integrated into the Coca-Cola System. We are still nevertheless an independent publicly traded company and as a result it’s been important for us to continue to negotiate agreements on terms that we believe will put us in a position where we can take protect ourselves and our brand if things -- the relationships didn’t go as planned. And so the contract that we have agreed to with the company as a principle and obviously now you take that to the individual bottlers they have their own lawyers, they have their own local laws and they have their own view of license, very respectfully many of them are not used to signing a contract of this nature, which is more akin to a finished product distribution agreement as oppose to a manufacturing concentrate bottler agreement, which puts a lot more discretion and decisions in the hands of the bottler whereas we tend to keep or want to keep most of those decisions about global marketing, about some of the local marketing and a number of things.  The other thing is that we obviously got to be very cautious that we don’t get into a situation, we have a large line of products for example and we don’t want to be in a position that if the bottler decide he wants to take one skew or three skews and not the rest that we are kept out of the market for the rest of the SKUs. So there are bones of contention that keep going up and down between the legal agreements and we’re getting through them, but it’s in many case that it’s really a question of literally educating a bottler in a country with their lawyers about why our agreement is in the form that why we need the protections? Then the other obviously is -- the other bucket is just goes back to the old life money, how do you share the value chain that’s available in the country and it’s just arm wrestling between us and the bottlers as to how do we get to a fair value share and in some cases we are at odds with the bottlers on what we believe we want out of the value share and we’re not going to compromise the value share and take less in order to simply try and get deals done. Because you want to move quickly I mean what we going to negotiate is going to stay with us for 20 or 30 years or whatever long the agreement are. So we really do want to have a fair relationship and a fair share of the value chain bearing in mind that we spend and do a lot more than it’s normally done by Coca-Cola Company in a bottler relationship when they split whatever the split is when they split their value chain the bottler picks up a lot more of the obligations. In our case we do and we don’t want to be in a position where we split the chain and we end up with still the lion share of the marketing and other expenses, which aren’t fairly shared. So it’s been in the negotiation and we just -- we’re getting through them one-by-one and I think that’s really the color I have got I don’t know Hilton if you would like to add to it?
Hilton H. Schlosberg: No, I think that’s absolutely right. One of the big issues the legal stuff can be negotiated and it is but it’s got to be a fair agreement in terms -- on commercial terms for us and a fair agreement for the bottler and often the bottler feels he is entitled to more and we as a brand owner have substantial expenses, have substantial marketing expenses and we have to ensure that after those marketing expenses we do a good deal for our shareholders. So it is a bit of a hedging, but as you can see from the agreements that have been finalized we’re moving forward and we’ll move forward in due course with some of the other bottlers or we won’t. And if it’s not there are other distribution partners that we’ll be working with. 
Rodney Cyril Sacks : Yes I agree. 
Operator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Caroline levy from CLSA. Your line is open.
Caroline Levy: Thanks so much, good morning. My question relates to margins which were just outstanding in the quarter 840 basis points improvement I believe and as you move into the next four quarters I believe you’ll get about a 250 basis points left from the benefit of the acquisition. So I just want to…
Hilton H. Schlosberg: So it’s your estimate.
Caroline Levy: Yeah I just want to be sure that within the margin expansion we did see there were no unusual items in the first quarter and obviously there is the benefit of the acquisition which will continue I think through most of the second quarter. But if there are any moving parts you can elaborate on little bit more on margins or is this the new status quo the…
Rodney Cyril Sacks : We spoke about the price increase number one; number two, we’ve got the Concentrate business has now kicked in it wasn’t in the first quarter of last year. So those are two factors that influenced margin in this quarter. There is product mix, which has also influenced margin so apart from those I’m not aware of anything unusual apart from those that influenced margin in the quarter.
Caroline Levy: And I'm wondering if you could…
Rodney Cyril Sacks : And in going forward yes we will have the benefit of the AFF transaction.
Caroline Levy: Yeah just because I think the strategic is the million dollar question on the company is do you think overtime international margins get pretty close to domestic and I mean we could talk in 5 or 10 year increments I guess is there a reason why international structurally would always be below the U.S.?
Hilton H. Schlosberg: Well pricing differs from country to country obviously and we have very good pricing in the U.S. and in some countries internationally we don’t benefit from the same pricing structures. So what we’ve done we don’t give projections as you know, we don’t give guidance, but what we’ve done in this quarter is we’ve actually given you the margins in the international territories in aggregate so you can see the trends in margin in EMEA and the trends in Asia Pacific and Central and South America.
Rodney Cyril Sacks : I think I’d like to just add is that if you look at international margins I think we should expect them to be lower than U.S. because of pricing and in many of those cases our cost of goods seems to be higher, we’re producing out of the U.S. particularly for the -- in the immediate future when volumes really get to the levels of the U.S. we’ll see some reduction but even then I think we should expect cost of goods to be higher internationally.  The other thing is that we go through the -- in looking at the mix it’s a mix bag Caroline because even internationally we’ve obviously got Concentrate business, which has got traditionally the higher margins, but as Monster and we think that ultimately the growth in the long-term for the company is that the Monster brand will grow while again we think we will get growth from the new brand there is some nice brands in the strategic group that will continue to grow as well. If you looked -- if we looked at it we think that ultimately the larger growth will come from Monster and then as Monster there will be a -- because they’re international there will be some slight reduction in overall margin, but you want to take the mix…
Hilton H. Schlosberg: Because it’s a finished goods margin. 
Rodney Cyril Sacks : Correct. And that’s [indiscernible]. So again I just want to bear that in mind so there I am conscious like a I think just a straight line and then take the incremental margin we should get from AAF and should be applied going forward. So while we do expect there to be an improvement in some immediate factors that one should take into account. 
Hilton H. Schlosberg: And we don’t give predictions. 
Operator: Thank you and I'm showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back to Rodney Sacks for any further remarks. 
Rodney Cyril Sacks : On behalf of Monster I’d like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad and in particular to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottler system internationally.  We are also particularly excited by the new opportunities that we have going forward with a robust portfolio of energy drink product throughout the world comprised of our Monster energy brand together with the strategic brands. Thank you very much for your attendance. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today’s conference. This concludes today’s program. You may all disconnect, everyone have a great day.

We are continuing to make good progress with the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers worldwide. We have successfully concluded negotiations with Coca-Cola bottlers in many countries, and are planning to launch Monster with these bottlers in most of their international markets in the near future. We have substantially completed the transition of Monster in most of the 28 countries serviced by the Coca-Cola Hellenic Group, and are currently in the process of transitioning the remaining countries. We have successfully launched Monster in Russia, and are moving forward with plans to commence production and distribution of Monster in Nigeria, through Coca-Cola Hellenic. We've also recently successfully transitioned our Monster brand in both Spain and Portugal to Coca-Cola Iberian Partners. We are continuing to transition a number of countries in Africa to Coca-Cola bottlers. This process will continue through the remainder of 2016. We've also reached agreement with Coca-Cola İçecek for distribution of Monster within the countries which fall within their Coca-Cola territory, which includes Turkey and 10 other countries. We've reached agreement with Coca-Cola Amatil, which distributes the Coca-Cola product in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Fiji. Finally, we having reached agreement with Big (3:42), the 100% owned Coca-Cola bottler that operates in a number of international markets, for the distribution of Monster in the majority of their markets. We've also made good progress in our discussions with FEMSA, Arca, and other bottlers operating in South America. Our plans to launch Monster in China are continuing to move forward with the Coca-Cola bottlers there. We received preliminary approval from the Chinese authorities for our Monster Energy formula, and are currently awaiting formal approval. We had a successful trial run in China, and are currently engaged in additional trial runs. We are still planning to launch Monster in China late in the second quarter of 2016, but the launch could be delayed by various factors, including regulatory approvals. We've also made good progress in the repositioning, repackaging, and reformulation of many of the Coca-Cola energy brands that were acquired as a result of the Coca-Cola transaction. As announced earlier in the week, we are pleased with our pending acquisition of the concentrated flavor business operated by American Fruits and Flavors, in California for $690 million in cash, subject to adjustment. The acquisition agreement was entered into on February 22, 2016 and we expect to close this transaction by the end of the first quarter of 2016. AFF is our principal supplier of concentrated flavors for our Monster Energy drink line. Our purchases from AFF represent approximately 87% of their sales. In 2015, AFF's total net revenues were approximately $168 million, and its adjusted operating income was approximately – sorry AFF – was approximately $87 million. It is our intention that AFF will continue to operate from its existing premises in Southern California, and will continue to carry on its business of supplying concentrates and flavors to third-party customers as it has in the past. Following the transaction, we will own the vast majority of the proprietary flavors that we use in our Monster Energy drinks including, in particular, the flavors used for our original green Monster Energy drink, Lo-Carb Monster Energy, and Monster Energy Absolutely Zero, the majority of the flavors that are used in our Java Monster and Ultra lines, as well as flavors used in many other Monster Energy drinks. We intend to continue to purchase concentrates and flavors from other flavor suppliers for both our existing products and new products we develop. Put simply, we intend to operate in the same way as we have in the past to ensure that we are able to develop and secure the best flavors in the future and to continue to excel at innovation. The acquisition of AFF will be immediately accretive to the company from the transaction's closing. The location of AFF's facilities in Southern California will facilitate our management of the business and the integration of AFF's business into the Monster organization. We are extremely excited by this acquisition, which aligns us with our principal flavor supplier, and will enable us to expand and secure most of our flavors at an economical cost. Our board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $1.75 billion of the company's outstanding common stock, which combined with the current outstanding authorization of $250 million remaining from the September 2015 repurchase program, totals $2 billion. We are planning to move forward with the return of capital in 2016 to our shareholders, pursuant to repurchases which could be effective pursuant to open market transactions, a modified Dutch auction tender offer, accelerated share repurchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, subject to applicable laws, regulations, and approvals. The timing of share repurchases, or a modified Dutch auction tender offer, will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Obviously, the company is expected to continue to generate cash from operations. In the fourth quarter, sales in the beverage industry in general, and of carbonated beverages in particular continue to show weakness. However, the sales of Monster Energy products accelerated in January. In the fourth quarter, the company achieved record gross sales of $743.2 million, up 6.7% from $696.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Net sales were $645.4 million, up 6.6% from $605.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Net sales in the fourth quarter were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $19.7 million. Net sales were also adversely affected by the buy-in before the price increase effective August 31, 2015, which had an estimated impact of approximately $11 million by destocking in Spain and South Africa, by existing international distributors in anticipation of our transition to Coca-Cola bottlers in these countries and also, by reduction in inventory in Germany during the fourth quarter, all of which had an estimated impact of $11.8 million. In total, such amounts had a negative impact on net sales of approximately $42.5 million in the fourth quarter. The increase in net sales after adjusting for these items would have been approximately 13.6% as compared to the reported increase of 6.6%. Our original green Monster Energy drink continued to perform well at retail. Retail sales of the Ultra line continue to show good growth in the United States during the fourth quarter, as did our Java Monster line. Gross profit as percentage of net sales was 62.5%, as compared to 54.8% for the comparable 2014 fourth quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to increased net sales of the Concentrate segment, which has higher gross margins than the Finished Products segment, the disposal of our non-energy brands, and the price increase on our 16-ounce Monster Energy drinks effective August 31, 2015. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.2%, as compared to 4.1% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as percentage of net sales were 12.9% compared to 9.3% in the same quarter a year ago. Sponsorship and endorsement costs, advertising expenses, principally for strategic brands, merchandise display costs, social media expenses, and commissions were all higher in the fourth quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. General and administrative costs including distributor terminations as a percentage of net sales for the 2015 fourth quarter were 11% as compared to 9.5% for the corresponding quarter in 2014. Payroll expenses were up $6.1 million due partially to increased staffing in connection with our acquisition of the strategic brands. Stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash item, was $3 million higher in the 2015 fourth quarter as compared to the same quarter last year. Distributor termination costs were $3.3 million higher in the fourth quarter as compared to the 2014 fourth quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing and promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's product were $3.1 million higher in the 2015 fourth quarter as compared to 2014 fourth quarter. In addition, other legal costs were $1.8 million higher for the 2015 fourth quarter. On a pro forma basis, giving effect to the items above, operating income for the quarter would have been approximately 31% higher than the reported operating income for the same quarter in 2014. Our effective tax rate increased from 34.7% to 39.5% in the fourth quarter primarily due to the reduction in the domestic production deduction. On an ongoing basis, we expect that our normalized tax rate will be approximately 36.5%. Net income was $138.7 million, compared to net income of $125.3 million during the fourth quarter of last year, an increase of 10.7%. However, due to the substantial increase in share capital, diluted shares increased from 174.9 million to 205.8 million following the issuance of shares to Coca-Cola, diluted earnings per share decreased to $0.67 for the fourth quarter from $0.72 in the 2014 comparable quarter. Turning to the full year results, the company achieved record gross sales of $3.1 billion for the full year, up 9.9% from $2.8 billion in 2014. Net sales were up 10.5% from $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. Net sales for the year were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, totaling $84.3 million for the year. The acceleration of deferred revenue added $39.8 million to net sales in 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 60% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 54.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating income was up 19.6% to $893.7 million from $747.5 million in 2014. Pro forma operating income is adjusted for acceleration of deferred revenue of $39.8 million. Distributor termination costs of $224 million, the Coca-Cola transaction expenses of $15.5 million as well as $161.5 million from the gain on the sale of the non-energy business was $931.9 million, an increase of approximately $23.9 million over 2014. Operations from outside of North America delivered operating income of $51.5 million for the 2015 full year as compared to operating income of $37.8 million for the 2014 full year. Our effective tax rate increased to 38.7% in 2015 from 35.2% in 2014. Net income was $546.7 million, up 13.2% over net income of $483.2 million in 2014. And diluted earnings per share increased 2.4% to $2.84 from $2.77 in 2014. Gross sales to customers outside the United States were $177.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $160 million in the corresponding quarter of 2014, an increase of 10.6%. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $145.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $133.8 million in the corresponding quarter of 2014, an increase of 8.6%. Foreign exchange movements had an unfavorable impact on gross sales of approximately $23.1 million, and our net sales were approximately $19.7 million. Gross sales to customers outside the United States were $713.2 million in 2015, compared to $657.9 million in 2014, an increase of 8.4%. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $580.3 million in 2015 compared to $534.2 million in 2014, an increase of 8.6%. Foreign exchange movements had an unfavorable impact on gross sales of approximately $102.4 million and on net sales of approximately $84.3 million. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through January 23, 2016 for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including energy shots increased by 9.9% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 10.7% in the 13 week period, while sales of NOS increased 5.3%, and sales of Full Throttle decreased 8.4%. Sales of Red Bull increased 10.1%, sales of Rockstar increased by 21.7%, sales of 5-hour increased 1.6%, and sales of AMP decreased 7.4%. According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended January 23, 2016, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars increased 7.9% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 8.9% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 2.4% and Full Throttle sales decreased 9.5%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 7.4%, Rockstar was up 19%, 5-hour was up 2.7%, and AMP was down 10.3%. According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended January 23, 2016, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel including energy shots in dollars increased by 0.3 points over the same period last year to 35%. NOS' share decreased 0.2 of a point to 4.1%, and Full Throttle share decreased 0.2 points to 1.1%. Red Bull share decreased 0.2 points to 34.6%, slightly below Monster share. Rockstar share was up 0.8 points at 8.4%. 5-hour share was lower by 0.4 points at 8.4%. And AMP share decreased 0.4 points to 1.8%. According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended January 16, 2016, sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 20.7% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 16.4% higher than the same period last year while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy was 39.7% higher. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended January 9, 2016, the energy drink category increased 5%. Monster sales were up 5% versus a year ago, in line with the category. Our markets share decreased 0.2 share points to 28.2%. Red Bull sales increased 8%, and its market share increased 1.6 points to 37.3%. Rockstar sales increased 10%, and its market share increased 0.8 points to 18.7%. According for Nielsen for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 40.7% during the month of December 2015. Monster sales increased 16.4%. Our market share decreased 5.5 points to 26.4%against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn, one of our acquired strategic brands, increased 19.5%, although Burn's market share decreased 1.1 points to 6%. Red Bull sales increased 13.6%, and its market share decreased by 4 points to 16.8%. Vive 100's market share increased 11 points to 31.3%, while Boost's market share decreased 2.1 points to 13.9%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced, positively and/or negatively, by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in their chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen in the 13 week period ended December 2015, the OXXO 13 week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 12.7% to 13.5% in Great Britain, from 17.8% to 20.3% in France, from 10.6% to 13.6% in Germany. In the same period, Monster's value share grew from 8.6% to 10.7% in Sweden, from 8.1% to 8.6% in Belgium, and from 5.9% to 6.7% in the Netherlands. Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ending December 2015 as compared to the same period last year decreased from 18.1% to 15.7% in South Africa, although value sales were higher according to Nielsen. Monster's retail market in value for the 13 weeks ending September 2015 in Spain increased from 21.7% to 23.7%, and in Italy decreased from 11.8% to 11%. According to IRI, Monster's market share in Greece increased in the 13 weeks to the end of December 2015 from 29.7% to 30.5%. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers and the IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen for the month of December 2015 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 20.3% as compared to 14.2% last year, and in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of November declined from 5.7% to 3.7% as compared to the same period last year. According to Nielsen in the 13 weeks to the end of December 2015, Monster's retail value sales grew 15.8% in Spain, 11.4% in South Africa, and 41.8% in Germany. For the top 20 EMEA markets which account for approximately 92% of EMEA Monster volume, Nielsen reports that in the 13 weeks to the end of December 2015 Monster's retail value sales grew 19.3%. According to INTAGE for the month of December 2015, the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 32.6% to 38.6%. The launch of Monster Energy Ultra in Japan continues to be a positive driver for the brand. Net sales for the Finished Products segment in the fourth quarter, formerly the DSD segment, but excluding Peace Tea, were negatively impacted by approximately $16 million of foreign currency movements in the fourth quarter, and by approximately $74.1 million for the year. Net sales for the Finished Products segment in the fourth quarter were also adversely affected by the buy-in of approximately $11 million before the price increase on August 31, 2015, and by destocking in the amount of approximately $11.8 million in Spain and South Africa, and a reduction in inventory in Germany as described above. On a pro forma basis, net sales for the Finished Products segment for the fourth quarter, after adjustments for these items, would have increased 8.5% from $574.8 million to $623.9 million in the quarter. On a pro forma basis, after adjusting for foreign currency movements of $74.1 million and $39.8 million of acceleration of deferred revenues, net sales for the Finished Products segment for the year would have increased 10.3% from $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion. Net sales for the company's new Concentrate segment were negatively impacted by approximately $3.7 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter, and by approximately $10.2 million for the year. On a pro forma basis, after adjustment for foreign currency movements, net sales for the Concentrate segment would have been $64.1 million for the quarter, ended December 31, 2015, and $153.5 million for the year. As a result of the Coca-Cola transaction which closed on June 12, 2015, there were no sales for the Other segment during the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to $30.8 million of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2014. And for the full year 2015, net sales for the Other segment were $60.8 million as compared to $150.4 million in 2014. In Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, net sales in the fourth quarter in euros increased 26.3%, and in dollars increased 10.2% over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 44.2% in the same period last year to 53.4% during the quarter. For 2015, net sales in euros increased 30.5%, and in dollars increased 8.8% over 2014. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 41.2% in 2014 to 48.4% during 2015. Despite the destocking issues described earlier, EMEA overall is now operating well, and we have made good strides in achieving increased sales distribution levels and in-store execution, including securing distribution by Coca-Cola bottlers in new countries and territories within the region. The launch of MEGA Monster in 553 ML cans with the resealable lid in limited additional markets in Europe has been successful and is largely incremental to our original Monster 500 ML size products. Additionally, we have continued the launch of a limited number of SKUs in the Ultra line, in a number of countries in Europe with positive initial response. Ultra will be launched in a further 15 markets in Europe in the first half of 2016. Monster sales depletions from our distribution partners to customers in the fourth quarter of 2015 were up 18.9% in EMEA. And in particular, sale depletions experienced double-digit growth in Spain, Germany, and South Africa. In Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Sweden, Monster achieved increased sales gains at retail as well as increased market share. In many international markets, where our independent distribution partners anticipated the Monster brand being transitioned to the Coca-Cola network, sales levels were markedly lower compared to last year than sales levels in markets which were already being distributed – we were already being distributed by the Coca-Cola bottler system also as compared to last year. We are pleased with the initial sales and distribution gains following the December launch of Monster in Russia. The rollout of Monster in Russia is currently taking place. In Asia-Pacific, net sales for the quarter increased 52.6% in local currencies, and 37.2% in dollars. For the year, net sales increased 45.1% in local currencies and 27% in dollars. Net sales in Mexico, Central and South America and the Caribbean for the quarter increased 28.8% in local currencies, and 10.7% in dollars. And for the year, increased 29.8% in local currencies and 15.7% in dollars compared to 2014. Monster's sales in Brazil were negatively impacted due largely to the overall difficult economic and market conditions there, together with the uncertainties for distributors relating to the Coca-Cola transaction. In Chile, sales of Monster continue to show good growth. Net sales in the quarter increased 114% over the fourth quarter of last year, and for 2015 increased 29.1% over 2014. In Mexico, net sales for the fourth quarter increased 24.4% in local currency and 5.4% in dollars as compared to the same quarter last year. And in 2015, net sales in Mexico increased 14.2% in local currency and 10.2% in dollars as compared to 2014. In Japan, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 15.3% in local currency and 4.1% in dollars as compared to the same quarter last year. And in 2015, net sales in Japan increased 32.4% in local currency and 13.4% in dollars as compared to 2014. We are moving ahead with production in India and anticipate reentering the market in India later in 2016. As mentioned earlier, we're optimistic that we will be able to finalize agreements with Coca-Cola bottlers in numerous countries in the near future. We're also continuing to evaluate production opportunities with Coca-Cola bottlers both in the U.S. and internationally, which we believe will yield cost reductions. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $2.2 billion compared to $370.3 million at December 31, 2014. Short-term investments were $744.6 million compared to $781.1 million at December 31, 2014. Long-term investments decreased $15.3 million from $42.9 million at December 31, 2014. All auction rate securities have now been redeemed in full and are no longer included in either short- or long-term investments. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 43.2 days at December 31, 2015, and 36.4 days at December 31, 2014. Inventories decreased to $156.1 million from $174.6 million at December 31, 2014. Average days of inventory was 58 days at December 31, 2015, which was slightly higher than 57.4 days of inventory at December 31, 2014. During the 2015 fourth quarter, we launched Ultra Black, which was previously sold last year on a limited time basis to a single convenience and gas chain, but it's now being made available to the general public. In the fourth quarter, we also launched Pipeline Punch nationally. In the first quarter of 2016, we launched Salted Caramel Java Monster, and are in the process of launching our new Gronk energy drink. We are planning to launch additional new products in 2016. Gross sales in January 2016 in dollars were approximately 9.5% higher than in January 2015. In local currencies, gross sales in January 2016 were approximately 12.2% higher than in January 2015. January 2015 gross sales included the old Warehouse division and Peace Tea. We caution again that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, our acquisition of AFF is exciting and represents an important milestone for the company through the ownership of the proprietary formulas for our principal products. This transaction will immediately be accretive to the company's earnings. Two, the board has authorized a new repurchase program of up to $1.75 billion of its equity securities, in addition to the $250 million available under the previously authorized $500 million share repurchase program. Once implemented, the effect of this repurchase program will be to substantially reduce the number of shares of common stock outstanding, and thereby enhance earnings on a per-share basis. Three, North American and international gross margins remained healthy and continued to improve. Four, the U.S. Nielsen market statistics and equivalent market statistics for many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is invariably growing ahead of the category. Five, the new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company's sales. We believe that the repositioning of our Juice Monster and Punch Monster lines continue to be positive. Six, we are particularly pleased with our performance in our international markets. Seven, we have successfully transitioned a number of countries to Coca-Cola bottlers and we have reached an advanced stage to transition many more markets to Coca-Cola bottlers from the second quarter of 2016. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you.
Operator: And our first question comes from Vivien Azer from Cowen. Your line is now open.
Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, thank you very much for taking the question. I have just one point of clarification. Hi. The $42.5 million impact, was that the global number or was that just international?
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: $42.5 million I believe is (34:00) it relates to international.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: Yes, it does.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Relates to international.
Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: That's just international. Perfect. Thank you for that. And so my bigger picture question, clearly, the underlying health of the business is just fine, and there's a lot of moving pieces in terms of this transition, but can you help give us a sense of the timeline of when we might expect some of this destocking and distributor transition disruption to abate, please? Thank you.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I just want to clarify, that $42.5 million does include the impact of destocking. Yeah, which is then global.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: Not the destocking, the buy-in.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: The buy-in. Sorry. It does include the buy-in.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: It does include the $11 million from that buy-in.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yep, so I want to just clarify that. Sorry, could you repeat your follow on question?
Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: Certainly. So lots of moving pieces, underlying business remains healthy, but the disruption is clearly a little bit painful, so can you give us a sense for how you see that progressing, and then we might be through that?
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. We are clearly having a choppy time just getting everything implemented and in line. There are a lot of moving pieces all over the world. And we believe that pretty much we should be done with a lot of the transitions by – we hope, by the end of the second quarter or at a position where we've at least negotiated the transitions, and are starting to implement them. That's been part of the uncertainty. Now that uncertainty will start being removed. We believe that the actual results will start flowing through once we've transitioned markets, and that does take some time. But we think that will be – we'll start seeing the impact of that through the second half of the year. But – so we really just believe it's been pretty much a year of transition for us from when we originally closed the transaction, and we are, as we've indicated throughout the call, at an advanced stage of our discussions with really the principal Coca-Cola bottlers around the world. So we do anticipate we will start seeing some really rapid advances in that regard.
Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you very much.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is now open.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Quickly, two things. One, can you give us a little more behind the thought process on the size of the share repurchase? Why not more? Why this? And then, also on the AFF acquisition yesterday, can you give us a little idea, I'm just trying to understand, should we just bake in that whole $90 million of operating income that you'll receive or is there some since they were a supplier, do you not get all of that? I mean, how do we model that going forward?
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: Bill, maybe I can answer that. Hi.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good afternoon.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: On your first question, I think you know that we are conservative folk when it comes to borrowing, and we took a decision, and the board took a decision that we would rather maintain a cash-positive situation, hence the amount of the buyback. So the results of the buyback will mean that we will not have to go into borrowings. So that's the answer to your first question. The answer to your second question is the $87 million operating income that we discussed is the operating income in 2015. Some of the customers may, in fact, choose not to continue with the company. But we account for 87% of the company's business. And the business that we place with AFF is indeed profitable to them. So as you model, I think a good chunk of that $87 million could be taken into enhancing operating income for the consolidated organization. But as results of the other 13%, it's really too premature to say. But the number will be determined in due course.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, good afternoon, guys. So the 9.5% gross sales in January, just want to clarify. So that includes the new Coke Concentrate acquired business, but also laps the old business, which includes the Warehouse business. Is that correct?
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: That is correct.
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. And then secondly, just trying to understand again the supply-demand reported versus, and demand metrics here, I don't get it. I mean, I understand there's moving parts here, but last quarter you killed numbers versus expectations. The June quarter was almost flat. This quarter, again, a miss relative to people's expectations. I get you don't give guidance. But, I guess, is there anything that you can help us sort of understand that makes us believe that the end demand per what we see in the scanner data in the U.S., what we hear from distributors outside of the U.S., is still consistent with how you believe your end demand is actually looking? And, obviously, then reconcile that with what you reported from a top line standpoint in the quarter.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I think that you've got to look at the – and that's a very good indicator, that's why we spent time on the call dealing with the Nielsen numbers, and we've actually also referred to some of the sales-out numbers from our distributors because that is more indicative of your ongoing and sort of more stable demand for our product. So Nielsen are just – as you know is pure scanned data, and therefore, that's the demand that's happening. And then your demand from retailers, unless there is a big promotion, that is also less choppy than our demand. Our demands are really – clearly, our demand for our products from our customers is choppy and that choppiness has been exacerbated during the last probably 12 months or so. But because of all these announcements, because of the changes, different bottlers or distributors have different policies in holding inventory. Some bolt up extra inventory because they would just – I think anticipate it being canceled, and having their own minds, that somehow that would give them a longer period to sell, or different opportunities to sell, and then you've got to deal with that inventory situation. And there were a lot of independent – there were independent bottlers, and that's part of the issues, and there was no consistent pattern. And that really is what has happened. And so, obviously, we can only report our revenues as they are and as they come into us, and we try and match them as well. And so, we believe that the – literally if you're looking to the trends, the more important trends are not our reports over the last three quarters or four quarters, but it is the Nielsen numbers which are showing consistent numbers, and showing good growth both in the U.S. and internationally. And that's what keeps us excited and makes us comfortable that as to the direction of our brand, and our brand is continuing to grow. And so as soon as we are able to actually get through all these transitions, get rid of the uncertainties, we will see long term growth that we think a healthy growth for the brand and for the company.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good afternoon.
John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC: I want to talk a little bit about the Concentrate revenues, and Hilton, you talked about this before that the numbers that we got in the filings were pro forma numbers, but it seems as though the Concentrate numbers continue to come in a little bit lower than – well, not a little bit this quarter, a lot lower than what I would have anticipated there. Is there – is that FX? Is that volume? Is that inventory adjustments at the bottlers as you look to transition to this new model? Is there something going on in terms of the Concentrate revenues versus the pro forma numbers that we got in the filings? Thank you.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: Well, some of it was indeed forex, as we highlighted that number on the call. Some of it was that some of the international distributors – international bottlers were, in fact, overstocked as we went into the transaction really to ensure that they would not miss a beat with regard to production. So, some of it is that. Some of it is indeed the fact that some of the KO brands have been falling off in market share, and that is something that we are addressing. We spoke earlier that we're repositioning a number of their brands – or a number of our brands. We're repackaging them, and we have a number of marketing initiatives going with regard to those brands. So a lot of it is a lot of all of that. But, in essence, I think we remain satisfied with the acquisition of the strategic brands, and we remain satisfied with the profitability that those strategic brands are generating to us relative to the purchase consideration that we paid.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. And we are starting to see positively – also I think there was a little bit of a drop-off in morale from the bottlers for some of those brands in some of the areas. And they hadn't seen sort of the levels of investment or a clear direction or positioning for those brands. We are taking steps to deal with that now and to address those issues. We've changed some of the marketing and the focus and the positioning of the brands and these things does take time to turn this around in different regions of the world. But we are doing that, and we've got into it now. We're introducing some new flavors. And as Hilton indicated, our packaging has changed on some of them and we're continuing to make changes. But most important, we've actually decided on some strategic positioning for the brands. And again, those are being changed. I mean in many cases, one of the higher costs we had was, for example, advertising. There was an advertising campaign that we committed in order to, in the best interest of the brands, we continue to be responsible for it. It was committed before we took over. But ultimately, we don't believe that that was really beneficial for the brand, and it's not a direction we're going on, so we've changed those directions. So these are the changes that we are making, and long-term, we believe we will stabilize and continue to grow these brands, but in slightly different ways.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: I think I also may have mentioned it, and if I didn't, I should say that some of those brands also did not benefit from the same level of marketing contribution that they had in the past. So they definitely, as we moved through the transition, there was a reduction in marketing expenditure on those brands.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yes, thanks. Just two questions from me. On the acquisition, does this flavor supplier, are they dealing with some of these new breakthrough products that you've been discussing, the three to four new products? Just wanted to get some clarity on that. And then the bigger picture question is when you think philosophically about how you launch into a market, should we think about it in a similar template on how you handle the U.S. in terms of kind of SKU by SKU, flavor by flavor, or do you think you'll go with a much broader SKU set as you enter some of these global markets? Thanks.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Just perhaps dealing with the SKU set, there isn't a one-formula-fits-all. In some countries, we'll launch with two or three flavors, but not a massive array of 10 flavors. In other countries, we'll do one or two flavors. And then obviously try and seed up our principal Green Monster, that's the flagship, that's where all our marketing around the world goes to, and get that on the shelf. And then basically expand from there as quickly or as slowly as we need in order to make sure that we're able to get our products on the shelf and they're able to sustain a satisfactory sell rate. And so that is (47:24) and that's what we've done throughout Europe and everywhere else. We started with two flavors, I think it was Green and then Lo-Carb, and then we introduced a juice, and then we introduced another. And that is how we've continued to go. In some of the Ultra flavors in Europe, we took the decision to actually introduce two or three at the same time as a line. So again, it's flexible, and it depends on where we see the demand and where we see the ability to secure shelf space for the products.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary: And then the second question – or the first question I think was is this flavor company involved in developing new flavors for us for new products? And the answer is yes. The other point I wanted to make earlier to Bill Chappell, and I'm just going to make it on the call, is that we spoke about the total net revenues of $168 million approximately from AFF. Please remember that as we go forward, a significant part of that will flow through in cost of sales and gross margin rather than in additional revenues, because on a consolidated basis, we will not reporting those sales as sales. They'll come into our financials as a reduction in cost.
Operator: This concludes Q&A for today. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Sacks.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you very much. One of the things I would like to perhaps just stress on the call is I think there've been one or two questions that were just posed to us as to why we did the transaction now and timing and we have other things. But I just wanted to say that this was an acquisition and the strategy behind buying and getting ownership of our own flavors was something we considered very important and valuable as far back as a decade ago. And we have made approaches repeatedly, we have spent time trying to negotiate. And really it came about last year that I think the owner was approaching getting I think close to his 80th birthday, and for the first time after an approach, they decided that they were receptive, the family, to an approach. And obviously, we took the opportunity when we could. It wasn't just spur-of-the-moment. This was something we've been wanting to do for a very long time. And then, there has been some other suggestion asked whether this is – people if we could expect more acquisitions along this line. We don't think so. We're not going to say, give you an emphatic no on anything. But certainly that is not our intention to get into the flavor business or concentrate business. We're not intending to expand it. This clearly was a very strategic acquisition for a supplier of almost all of our products. And for us, we're able to lock up pretty much most of these revenues, or our revenues, as we sell. As we go forward, every additional case of Monster we sell, that will be additional margin that we will able to basically drop to our bottom line. So we see this as a very low risk and a very strategic acquisition. It's based in California, it's easy to manage. It's not a massive staff. It's not a very capital intensive business. It has a very low capital base, a very low working capital requirement. It was also strategic we felt to enable our flavor supplier to grow internationally with us. As a private company, they had faced some challenges in many countries and actually having the resources and the expertise to have their flavors get through the regulatory process in these countries and be able to import ingredients, and particularly ingredients and supply them in country. And not being an international base, but yet their flavors were obviously very, very important and key for us. So we believe that by aligning ourselves with them, we will be able to facilitate and help them through, on the regulatory side. We have quite a deep bench of staff here who understand regulatory issues and legal issues, or in the regulatory area. We also obviously, as it's important for us, as we expand into many more countries and many more distant places, we want to really have the opportunity to put our best foot forward and have these key flavors come from this supplier and not have to resort to alternative suppliers. But that being said, obviously we do also still intend to continue to work with our existing suppliers, because we want everybody to – we want to obviously ensure that we're still able to get cutting edge technology, cutting edge flavors, have everybody stay competitive whether it's on the AFF side or our independent suppliers side. And so for all those reasons we do believe this transaction to be very, very important for us going forward. Thanks, everybody, for your continued interest in the company. We continue to obviously believe in the company and our growth strategy and are committed to continuing to develop and to differentiate our brands and to expand the company, both at home and abroad and in particular, to expand distribution of our products, including the strategic brands, through the Coca-Cola bottler system internationally. We are particularly excited by the new opportunities that we have going forward with our robust portfolio, together with our newly acquired strategic brands. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2015 Q3  (2015-11-05 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Rodney Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hilton Schlosberg - Vice Chairman and President Thomas Kelly - Senior Vice President of Finance
Analysts: Kevin Grundy - Jefferies Mark Astrachan - Stifel Caroline Levy - CLSA Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Corporation Third Quarter 2015 Financial Results Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO for Monster Beverage Corporation. Please go ahead.

A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. As previously announced, the transaction with The Coca-Cola Company closed on June 12, 2015. We are continuing to implement our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers worldwide. Our transition in Germany in July was successfully implemented and we are starting to see an improvement in the quality of our distribution with and execution by that bottler. We are also pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement with the Coca-Cola Hellenic Group that will be applied across 28 countries serviced by them for Coca-Cola. Monster is currently being distributed through the Hellenic Group in approximately 14 countries. We are currently in the process of signing agreements and planning for the transitions and or launches of Monster in the remaining 14 countries within the Hellenic Group's distribution network. Of particular note are our plans to transition our brand from our existing distributors in Italy, Romania, Ukraine, Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia to Hellenic as well as to launch Monster in Russia through Hellenic before the end of this year. Another substantial opportunity for us with Hellenic is the planned launch of Monster in Nigeria in 2016. We have commenced discussions regarding the production of Monster locally with Hellenic in Nigeria, which is one of the two largest energy drink markets in Africa, the other being South Africa. Besides the agreement with Hellenic we have also reached definitive agreements with the Coca-Cola bottlers in Spain and Portugal, which are large markets for Monster. We are planning to transition monster in Spain and Portugal from our existing distributors to Coca-Cola Iberia partners early in the first quarter of 2016. We have had positive discussions with the Coca-Cola bottlers in Southern Africa and are in the process of commencing the distribution of Monster in a number of countries in Southern and Central Africa through Coca-Cola bottlers. We are planning to commence local production of Monster in South Africa in the next few months. We are also planning to launch Monster in China. We have filed applications for approval of our product and have commenced negotiations with the Coca-Cola bottlers for production and distribution of Monster in China. Although the approval process could take longer, we are still planning to launch Monster in China in the first half of 2016. We are also pleased to report that we entered into a definitive agreement with Coca-Cola Beverage Company owned by Ladies and gentlemen Household & Health Care Limited in Korea to distribute Monster in South Korea and are in the process of making transitioned arrangements with them. We are continuing negotiations regarding the prospective transitioning of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers in South and Central America as well as in Australia. While we have made good progress, many legal and financial issues still need to be resolved. We are hopeful that we will be able to make further progress over the next few months. We are also engage in ongoing negotiations to transition monster to Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of smaller countries worldwide. We intend to continue to manage the Coca-Cola energy brands, which we acquired and refer to as our strategic brands, as a Concentrate business similar to the manner in which the Coca-Cola company operated such business prior to the closing of the transaction. Under the Concentrate model, concentrate and our beverage base is sold to bottlers who add other common ingredients in containers to produce the finished product. We will, however, continue to operate a finished product model for our own Monster energy drinks consistent with the manner in which we have historically run our business. Such arrangements will form part of our Finished Products segment. As previously indicated our reportable segments will reflect our view of the business going forward. In this quarter we reported on three operating and reportable segments: one, Finished Products, the principle product of which include the company's Monster energy drink products, which previously comprised the majority of the former DSD segment; two, Concentrate, the principle of which include the strategic brands acquired from Coca-Cola; three, Other, the principle products of which include the brands disposed of as a result of the Coca-Cola transactions including those which previously comprised the majority of the former Warehouse segment and the Peach tea brand. Sales in the quarter continued to be negatively impacted by foreign exchange movements as well as the uncertainty faced by many of our independent international distributors outside of the Coca-Cola network given the anticipated implementation of the transitions in their territories. Additionally our bottle in Great Britain experienced production issues causing production to be suspended for a number of weeks towards the end of the quarter and most of October resulting in loss sales to us both for the quarter and in October. Although substantial progress was made during the third quarter, results were still affected by out of stock retail, although at a lower level than in the previous quarter. Gross sales for the 2015 third quarter were $862.4 million compared to gross sales of $738.1 million in the comparable third quarter of 2014, an increase of 16.8%. Net sales in the 2015 third quarter were $756.6 million as compared to $636 million in the same period last year, an increase of 19%. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of approximately $34.1 million on gross sales and approximately $28.6 million on net sales. Gross and net sales were impacted by advanced purchases made by our customers in the quarter due to a price increase effective August 31, 2015 on certain of our Monster 16 ounce energy drinks. We estimate that approximately $12 million of gross sales and $11 million of net sales in the quarter were attributable to such advance purchases. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales were 61.5% as compared to 53.8% for the comparable 2014 third quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to net sales of the Concentrate segment, which has higher gross margins than the Finished Products segment as well as the sale of the non-energy brands, the price increase referred to earlier, lower cost of certain raw materials and changes in product sales mix. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.5% for the 2015 third quarter compared to 4.5% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.7% compared to 10.1% in the same quarter a year ago. Advertising costs, sponsorships and endorsements as well as commissions and royalties were all higher in the third quarter. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the 2015 third quarter were 8.8% as compared to 9.2% for that corresponding quarter last year. Parallel expenses were up $7 million due partially to increased staffing in connection with the Coca-Cola transaction. Stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $8.9 million for the third quarter of 2015 compared to $7.4 million in the same quarter last year. Gross sales to customers outside the United States were $207.8 million in the 2015 third quarter compared to $173.2 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014, an increase of 20%. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $170.6 million in the 2015 third quarter compared to $136.3 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014, an increase of 25.2%. Foreign exchange movements had an unfavorable impact on gross sales of approximately $34.1 million and our net sales of approximately $28.6 million. Included in gross sales to customers outside the United States are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transfer to the military and their customers overseas. According to the Nielsen Reports for the 13 weeks through October 24, 2015 for all outlets combined, that'd be convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including shots increased by 10.1% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 9.3% in the 13-week period while sales of NOS increased 6.8% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 6.7%. Sales of Red Bull increased 11.2%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 28.5%. Sales of 5-hour increased 2.8% and sales of AMP decreased 3.9%. According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended October 24, 2015 sales in the convenience and gas channel including energy shots in dollars increased 8.6% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 4.3% over the same period last year while NOS is up 3.9% and Full Throttle sales decreased 5.5%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 11.2%. Rockstar was up 32.1%. 5-Hour was up 3.5% and AMP was down 6.6%. According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended October 24, 2015 Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel including energy shots in dollars decreased by 1.5 points over the same period last year to 34.9%. NOS' share decreased by 0.2 of a point to 3.9%. Full Throttle's share decreased 0.2 of a point to 1.1%. Red Bull's share increased 0.8 points to 34.8%, slightly below Monster's share. Rockstar's share was up 1.5 points at 8.2%, which is similar to the market share Rockstar had two years ago. 5-Hour's share was lower at 8.2% and AMP's share decreased 0.3 points to 2%. According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended October 24, 2015 sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 9.6% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 5.9% higher than in the same period last year while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy was 16.6% higher. According to Nielsen in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended September 19, 2015 the energy drink category increased 8%. Monster sales were up 32% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 5.7 points to 30.4% over the same period last year. Red Bull sales increased 1% and its market share decreased 2.5 points to 39.1%. Rockstar sales increased 6% and its market share decreased 0.4 points to 16%. According to Nielsen for all outlets combined in Mexico the energy drink category grew 31% in the month of August 2015. Monster sales increased 24%. Our market share decreased 1.8 points to 32.2% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn, one of our acquired brands, increased 8% although Burn's market share decreased 1.1 points to 5.2%. Red Bull sales increased 8% and its market share decreased by 3.7 points to 17.8%. Vive 100's market share increased 5.1 points to 26.9% while Boost's market share decreased 0.1 of a point to 13.1%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen for the 13-week period ended September, 2015 the actual 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 11.4% to 12% in Great Britain, from 16.6% to 19.4% in France and from 8.9% to 12% in Germany. In the same period Monster's value share grew from 8% to 9% in Sweden, from 7.9% to 8.7% in Belgium and from 5.6% to 6.1% in the Netherlands. Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ended in the August, 2015 as compared to the same period last year decreased from 17.6% to 15.7% in South Africa, although in local currency sales were higher. Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ending September, 2015 in Spain decreased from 22.75 to 22.1% and in Italy decreased from 12.6% to 10.3%. These latter three markets all have independent distributors. According to IRI Monster's market share in Greece increased for the 13 weeks to the end of September, 2015 from 28.2% to 29.4%. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and the IRI in the EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen for the month of September, 2015 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 18.3% as compared to 11.8% last year and in Brazil Monster's market share for the month of September declined from 5.7% to 3.7% as compared to the same period last year. According to INTAGE for the month of September, 2015 the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 30% to 39.2%. The launch on Monster Energy Ultra in Japan has been positive and sales continued to be solid. As stated earlier, the company has revised its reportable segments into Finished Products, Concentrate and Other. Net sales for the Finished Products segment, formerly the DSD segment but excluding Peach tea increased 15.5% to $686.7 million and operating income for the Finished Products segment increased 25.3% to $289.5 million in the 2015 third quarter. Net sales for the Finished Products segment were negatively impacted by approximately $23.1 million of foreign currency movements and operating income for the Finished Products segment was negatively impacted by approximately $2.5 million of distributor termination costs. Net sales for the new Concentrate segment were $69.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and operating income for the Concentrate segment was $45.3 million. Net sales for the Concentrate segment were negatively impacted by approximately $5.5 million of foreign currency movements. As a result of the Coca-Cola transaction, which closed on June 12, 2015, there were no sales for the Other segment during the third quarter of 2015 as compared to $41.6 million of net sales in the third quarter of 2014. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa net sales in the third quarter in local currencies increased 45.4% and 19.9% in dollars over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 38% in the same period last year to 51.5% during the quarter. While Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increase market share in Europe, throughout the third quarter growth in Spain and Italy in particular were negatively impacted due to the uncertainty following the Coca-Cola transaction. We believe that this situation will be reversed once Monster is transitioned in these countries to the Coca-Cola bottlers. Overall EMEA is now operating well and we have made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and in-store execution. EMEA traded profitability during the third quarter. We are continuing with the launch of Mega Monster in 553 ML cans in limited additional markets in Europe. Response from consumers has been positive and we believe sales from Mega Monster are largely incremental to sales of our original Monster 500 ML size products. In particular in Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Netherlands, Poland and Sweden, Monster achieved increased sales gains as well as increased market share. It is noteworthy that in many of our international markets where our distribution partners anticipate the Monster brand being transitioned to the Coca-Cola network, sales levels as compared to the same level last year were markedly lower than the sales levels in those markets which are being managed by the Coca-Cola bottler system also as compared to last year. In Asia Pacific net sales in the third quarter increased 64% in local currencies and 42.6% in dollars over the comparable quarter last year. Net sales in Mexico, Central and South America and the Caribbean in the third quarter increased 65.8% in local currencies and 45.7% in dollars over the comparable period in 2014. Monster sales in Brazil were negatively impacted due largely to the overall difficult economic and market conditions in Brazil along with the uncertainty for the distributor there associated with the Coca-Cola transaction. In Japan net sales increased by 11% in dollars and 34.1% in local currency during the quarter as compared to the same quarter last year. In Mexico net sales increased by 48.8% in dollars and 72.6% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. Both Japan and Mexico contributed meaningful operating profits to the region in the third quarter of 2015. India continues to be impacted by regulatory issues and we continued to incur losses in the first quarter. We are addressing these issues and hope to achieve a resolution in the near future. We continue to be actively involved in discussion with prospective Coca-Cola bottlers in numerous countries around the world regarding distribution opportunities for our Monster Energy drinks. We are also evaluating a large number of local production opportunities with Coca-Cola bottlers but in the U.S. and internationally which we believe will yield cost reductions. As previously reported, we have reformulated and repositioned our Muscle Monster line. In September a new Juice Monster drink named Pipeline Punch was launched exclusively with 7-Eleven. During the 2015 third quarter the company purchased approximately 2.9 million shares of the common stock and every purchase price of $134.43 per share. Purchases were made under a prior repurchase program authorized by the Board which has been exhausted as well as under the new 500 million share repurchase program announced in September 2015. Subsequent to the close of the 2015 third quarter, the company purchased an additional 0.6 million shares.
Hilton Schlosberg: 0.06.
Rodney Sacks: 0.06 million shares at an average purchase price of $134.12 per share. The company has approximately $250 million available under its current board authorize repurchase program. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $1.2 billion compared to $370.3 million at December 31, 2014. Short-term investments were $1.5 billion compared to $781.1 million at December 31, 2014. Long-term investments decreased to $34.4 million from $42.9 million at December 31, 2014. Including short and long-term investments our auction rate security is $1.5 million, which are now being redeemed in full. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 43 days at September 30, 2015 and 36.4 days at December 31, 2014 compared to 38.5 days at September 30, 2014. Inventory decreased to $159.7 million from $174.6 million at December 31, 2014. Average days of inventory was 49.4 days at September 30, 2015 which was lower than the 57.4 days of inventory at December 31, 2014 and lower than the 62.9 days at September 30, 2014. In November we will be launching Pipeline Punch as well as Ultra Black nationally. Our reposition of Monster Energy Rehab, Juice Monster and Punch Monster lines all continue to make good progress. We are planning to launch additional new products early in 2016. Gross sales in October 2015 in dollars adjusted for the advance purchases I referred to earlier were approximately 6.8% higher than October 2014. In local currencies gross sales in October adjusted for the advanced purchases I referred to earlier were approximately 10.6% higher than in October 2014. October 2014 included the old warehouse division and Peach Tea. October 2014 comes to a high. October also had one less selling days in October 2014 and was also negatively impacted by the production issues experienced in Great Britain. We caution again that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. In conclusion I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, we continue to be pleased with the Coca-Cola transaction and the opportunity that this presents to the company. Two, North American and international gross margins are healthy and continue to improve. Three, the U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that the energy category is continuing to grow. Four, the new additions to the Monster family continue to gain market share and add to the company's sales. Ultra continues to perform well, we believe that the changes made to and the repositioning of our Rehab, Juice and Punch Monsters lines have been positive. With regard to international markets, we are particularly pleased with the performance of a number of our international markets, particularly Japan, Great Britain, Germany, France, Belgium, Sweden, Chile, Ireland and Greece. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen on the phone lines [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Kevin Grundy: Hey, thanks. Good evening, guys.
Rodney Sacks: Good evening.
Kevin Grundy: So first a broader question and then just a couple brief modeling questions. First, can you talk about the investment that you think is going to be necessary specifically in Russia and China with your big opportunities, but relatively going to be new markets for you? Talk about what sort of lift you're expecting there, how you're defining success and then if you could touch on the investment piece? And then a modeling question for you, Hilton. Just margins were particularly strong in the quarter. What we should expect there for the balance of the year going forward? And then some guidance on the long-term tax rate. Thank you very much.
Rodney Sacks: I think that much of what you're asking is really forward-looking, which we have historically not given and we're not going to give. So the large part of your question will remain unanswered. We don't believe there is - at this point, our intention in launching in Russia is not going to be different to the way we have historically launched. And there may be some changes in China but it's too premature for us to even make that decision. We've not made it. We are at the moment evaluating the market and how we're going to go to market in Russia. Again, we do not believe that those would be extraordinarily high or different in any way to how we've gone in the past but it really is premature for us to give you any real indication on that. With regards to the tax rate, Hilton will give you some response on that going forward and I'll hand over to him.
Hilton Schlosberg: Okay. Kevin, there were two questions you asked. One was about margins and, as you know, we do not give guidance. However, what I can tell you is that we took a price increase on certain of our Monster 16-ounce line effective August 31. So we had one month of sales with increased prices and there were buy-ins in that period as well, which we referred to, and there were some buy-ins in September. So you can factor that into your analysis. The second thing is we have looked at the tax rate and we believe here and obviously we stand corrected but we think our tax rate should be more normalized at about 37.5%.
Kevin Grundy: Very good. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Your line is now open.
Mark Astrachan: Yeah, hey. Good afternoon, guys.
Rodney Sacks: Hi, Mark.
Mark Astrachan: Just a couple of logistics modeling type questions. Could you give the split of your legacy business sales in the U.S. and international so we can get a sense of the comparisons there? And then separately, just curious how you think the price increase has impacted your market share and volumes just broadly? And then sort of market dynamics, I know there's been a lot made of a strange weeks' worth of data in the scanner services. So curious if you could comment on that. And obviously in the context of the weaker results in October, sort of hearing what you're saying, how much of that is the pieces that you were talking about, the moving parts versus underlying weakening and in demand for you or just the category broadly?
Rodney Sacks: Yeah, just to start with the Nielsen in October, the months particularly of October was sort of a choppy month. And we just think that it's the timing of promotions, the timing of launches. Things are sort of - with all these other factors, we think they did have some influence over it. We don't believe that it will be ongoing but we believe that the rest of the quarter will improve. But we still see strength in the category. We have a number of new products launches planned for the beginning, early next year and running through a number of quarters next year. So we believe that you just should not have that high regard or influence on the single month's numbers. With regard to the split between the legacy, we've given you that split throughout the company. We haven't divided it into the U.S. versus the rest of the world. And I don't have that debt number about what we've done it. We look at it in country by country and regions. So I don't have that really but I'm not sure that we should be providing that information at this point we know because then that starts creating other issues and segments. And so at this point we'd like to just leave it at the Finished Products and Concentrates segments as a group going forward.
Mark Astrachan: Okay. Thank you.
Rodney Sacks: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Caroline Levy of CLSA. Your line is now open.
Caroline Levy: Could you just clarify, when you said October's up 7%, was that including international? That was a worldwide number?
Rodney Sacks: Yes.
Caroline Levy: Okay. And 10 if you exclude the advanced purchases?
Rodney Sacks: Forex.
Caroline Levy: Oh, that was forex?
Rodney Sacks: Yeah.
Caroline Levy: Okay. Sorry, sorry. Would you be able to give us the breakup - I mean your case sales seem to include Concentrate, which then distorts what your Finished Product, we can't get at what Finished Product grew or what net revenue per Finished Product case looks like. Would you be willing to share that?
Rodney Sacks: So you're looking for a break out again of the Finished Product cases and we, again, this is...
Hilton Schlosberg: We haven't - you'll see the statement information. You'll see Finished Goods and you'll see Concentrates in the Q, which we're hoping to release tomorrow or Monday. So you'll have that then. And we're looking forward as whether it will make sense to give case numbers.
Caroline Levy: Because I think it's very hard to model something if we don't have an idea of what volume pricing - and you give us contact I think by division, but we need that volume in pricing by division, if at all possible. So anyway just lastly, could you talk - getting back to share loss, which is what we're seeing in the measured data and we actually haven't seen that for several years. And then a few months ago Red Bull started growing significantly faster than you guys. And I thought maybe with the price increase you would catch up but it doesn't appear to be happening. So are there any other dynamics over the past couple of months that would have affected that other than launch timing?
Rodney Sacks: Well, again it depends on how you, you've got to look at the two-year step numbers and where we were. So those have quite a big impact on share, or if you take share loss. Red Bull's numbers are basically been a percent or two above ours generally. And but again, they had - they took a price increase in January at a slightly higher level which seems to have stuck. We are really just starting to try and get the - our price level solidified. But if you look at cases and units, then our market share in fact increased and ahead of Red Bull's.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question...
Hilton Schlosberg: So and that's what I'm a little confused about, Caroline, because we mentioned on the call today that in convenience, which is a major sector, our share's actually higher than Red Bull's. So what you're looking at is year-on-year historical 2014 versus 2015. But if you look at the actual share, our share in convenience according to Nielsen is bigger than that of Red Bull.
Rodney Sacks: And it's been trending that way for the last three months. We've been increasing share. So these figures are sometimes - you've got to read, depends how you read them.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Pablo Zuanic of SIG. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is - good afternoon. This is actually Atisha on behalf of Pablo. I have more of a strategic level question. For the markets where you're planning to keep your distributors, what kind of emphasis will be played on the energy drink brands acquired? And can we expect any kind of attrition cannibalization of those brands? And on the flip side, where you will be moving to the new Coke system in the countries, should we expect some attrition for those brands? And if not, how will those brands be segmented in those countries.
Rodney Sacks: I think that we don't believe there will be any attrition in our business. The whole strategy is that in those countries that we stay with our existing distributors like Japan, then they will stay with whatever portfolio they have and if we have portfolio that we've acquired, in Japan there just isn't one but in other countries where there is one then that will be managed through the Coke bottler. We've taken assignment of the Coke distribution arrangement or contract and that will simply be managed. In the cases where we are going to transition Monster, we are going to transition them and the outputs are managed separately. You've got Monster going into that bottler and we obviously have bought and paid for the strategic brand and we are going to manage those brands. It is our job basically to try which is different to how Coke obviously looks at their competitors, but now that we have both brands in our country, we're going to look to try and segment them and position them differently. But they both are important brands they both are, in each country good contributors to our bottom line and to our growth as a company and to giving us a stronger position, overall in the energy category in that country if you aggregate the two brands, in many countries it gives us a very strong and leading position, which I think also helps us. And obviously from a management point of view, where we can use the same stop we will try to rationalize it. But in some cases we feel you do need additional stops to take in focus on their own brand in a country. So I don't' think there will be attrition. The attrition will come from if the brand is not strong enough in a particular country to sustain its distribution or shelf space then there will be attrition but obviously we're going to try and put focus on this and try to avoid that. So at the moment, obviously we are going through a learning curve with some of then we brands. We are repositioning the new brands, we are looking to redesign them and reevaluate their size, containers, and whether we need a different size or a single size. Some of them there are too many size containers and different flavors in different countries for the same brand. We are trying to rationalize some of these and improve some of the flavors. We have plans to introduce some innovation and some new flavors for these brands, these strategic brands in 2016. So we are positive about them and that they will be managed differently and they will be managed separately, but we obviously are looking to put support behind and to do our best with all of the brands that we have in our portfolio with the energy focus. That remains our focus in that category.
Operator: Thank you and our next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Judy Hong: Thank you. Hi, everyone.
Rodney Sacks: Hi, Judy.
Judy Hong: I have two questions. One is, Rodney, just a little bit more color on China as you think about 2016. One, just in terms of the clarification on where you are on the approval process. I think you said you're still expecting to launch in the first half. Any risk that it gets delayed into the back half? And then just in terms of distribution opportunity, just given the strengths of the Coca-Cola system in that country, do you expect to see distribution ramp up pretty quickly in China versus some of the other countries that you've entered? And then the second question is really on return of capital that you, in prior calls, you have commented on the Board actively looking at ways to return more cash to shareholders. Obviously, you still have a pretty sizeable cash balance on your balance sheet. But any sort of update in terms of the Board's willingness to actually take on some leverage and return even more cash to shareholders?
Rodney Sacks: I'll let Hilton answer the second one. I'll address the first one, which divides the questions up. On distribution in China, we are looking at going into China not very differently to how we've addressed most of the markets where we believe we have the best prospect of success. And again, without having taken a final decision, it is unlikely that we're going to have some sort of massive national launch with big TV campaigns behind it. We like to go into a country, we'll take a number of areas or types of chains or class of business and focus on that and roll it out. And it may mean that it takes some time. It doesn't - it may not go through all of the provinces. China is very, very big. It's like saying in America, how would we launch? Well we launched in America in one county, in San Diego. And we launched in one county in Northern California. And then you sit down and grow from there and develop it. We think that that type of launch, and not necessarily one county, I mean one city, but that type of launch is far better. If it's a smaller country, it's a lot easier to get your distribution up. But China is a massive country, it's like a continent. And we're still working through the strategy as to how do we launch, where do we launch, what cities do we launch in, do we launch a little slower in two different or three different types of cities, more modern or a little more traditional, get the responses and see how we position the brand. We're going into a new market with new culture and new consumers. And it is very, very, we believe, a great opportunity for the company and enormous growth. But we need to do it correctly and we need to do it right. And we're right in the middle of this process, so it's premature for us to give you any further direction. As to the process, there are a number of alternative categories in which we believe our drinks can conform. We've made applications in two places for our products in two or three different categories. Those are currently being processed. I don't know how long it'll take. We don't think that they will take that long. We think - we are hoping in the next few months to start getting some positive response and maybe get some approvals but we really don't know how long it is. We've not done it before so we don't know. And we do have different ingredients and therefore a different time line. We can't just simply look back and compare a soda and say, how long does it take for a soda to get approved? It's a different product with different ingredients. But we still believe that we have a good prospect of launching the first half, perhaps a little later than we thought maybe a few months ago but we still think that we have a good shot of going in the first half of launching in China. And perhaps, Hilton will then take your other question.
Hilton Schlosberg: Judy, the Board is still reviewing options with regard to return of capital to shareholders and we will update shareholders once this decision has been finalized. At this time, no final decision has been taken how best to accommodate a buyback. You also asked a question about leverage and I think my answer is the same answer I've given in the past. Some of us may have a - personally have an aversion to that but it's a Board decision and the Board will determine what's in the best interests of shareholders and the company. So just watch this space. That's all I can say.
Judy Hong: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes our Q&A session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Sacks for closing remarks.
Rodney Sacks: On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy, and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. We are particularly excited by the new opportunities that we have going forward with a robust portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world comprised of our Monster Energy brand together with our newly-acquired strategic brands. We believe that our agreements with the Coca-Cola Company will enable us to focus on our core energy business while leveraging the strength of The Coca-Cola Company's powerful distribution and bottling system on a worldwide scale. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.

===== 2015 Q2  (2015-08-06 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary, Monster Beverage Corp.
Analysts: Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States) John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Corporation's Second Quarter 2015 Financial Results Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Sir, please begin.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today, as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed March 2, 2015, as well as our most recent report on Form 10-Q filed May 11, 2105, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures which may be mentioned during the course of this call is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated, August 6, 2015. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. As previously announced, the transaction with The Coca-Cola Company finally closed on June 12, 2015. Under the agreement, The Coca-Cola Company acquired an approximate 16.7% ownership interest in Monster following the issuance of shares to The Coca-Cola Company. The Coca-Cola Company also transferred ownership of its worldwide energy business to Monster and Monster in turn transferred its non-energy business to The Coca-Cola Company. We are excited about our partnership and believe that it will strategically align both companies for the long term by combining the strength of The Coca-Cola Company's worldwide bottling system with Monster's dedicated focus and expertise as a leading energy player globally. We are now actively engaged in implementing our strategic alignment and have commenced discussions with Coca-Cola bottlers in many countries around the world. Our first international transition to a Coca-Cola bottler was accomplished in Germany in early July. There are a number of hurdles to be overcome, both legal and financial, in finalizing the award of distribution rights to new international bottlers. We intend to continue to manage The Coca-Cola energy business, which we refer to our as our strategic brands, as a Concentrate business as The Coca-Cola Company did prior to the closing of the transactions. We will, however, continue to operate a finished product model for our Monster Energy drinks consistent with the manner in which we have historically run our business. Under our historical Finished Products model, we sell Finished Products to our distributors. Under the Concentrate model, Concentrate and/or beverage base is sold to bottlers who add other common ingredients and containers to produce the finished product. As a result, we have revised our reportable statements to reflect management's view of the business. In this quarter, we report on three operating and reportable segments. First is the Finished Products segment, the principal product of which include the company's Monster Energy drink products, which previously comprised the majority of the former DSD segment. Second is Concentrate, the principal product of which include the strategic brands acquired from Coca-Cola. And the third is Other, the principal product of which include the brands disposed-off as a result of The Coca-Cola transactions, including those which were previously comprised the majority of the former warehouse segment and the Peach Tea brand. We are endeavoring to accelerate the pace of our negotiations with Coca-Cola bottlers with a view to be able to transition a number of additional international markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in the future. Sales in the quarter were negatively impacted by foreign exchange movements. The impact of the transitions of a substantial majority of our Monster distribution rights in the United States earlier this year, the lower inventory levels maintained by Coca-Cola bottlers versus the Anheuser-Busch distributors, and the uncertainty faced by many of our independent international distributors outside of The Coca-Cola network, given the anticipated implementation of the transactions, all negatively affected our sales growth during the second quarter. Both the Nielsen numbers, which reflect retail sales to consumers, as well as distributed depletions, which reflect sales out by distributors and bottlers to their customers, were substantially less affected by the transition. Results during the second quarter were also negatively affected by out-of-stocks, which occurred in certain geographies due to the learning curve associated with the transitions to The Coca-Cola network. Also the transition has progressed relatively smoothly in the United States; there is always some disruption when transitioning distribution. This learning curve is not dissimilar to what we experienced when we transitioned a large part of our distribution in the United States to The Coca-Cola bottlers some six years ago. But it was temporary. They got up to speed relatively quickly and we believe that the same will occur here. In addition to our GAAP condensed consolidated statement of income and other information and our GAAP condensed consolidated balance sheet for the company for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, attached to our press release is a non-GAAP adjusted condensed consolidated statement of income and other information adjusting for certain of the selected items discussed in the press release impacting profitability, which we believe should be considered in assessing our performance in this quarter. We believe it would be helpful to shareholders on this call to address our results on an adjusted basis, after giving effect to such items in addition to and not in lieu of our GAAP results. Gross sales for the 2015 second quarter were $789.9 million compared to gross sales of $779 million in the comparable second quarter of 2014. Net sales in the 2015 second quarter were $693.7 million as compared to $687.2 million in the same period last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of approximately $29.9 million on gross sales and approximately $23.9 million on net sales. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 56.9% as compared to 55.2% for the comparable 2014 second quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to net sales of the Concentrate segment, which has higher gross margins than the Finished Products segment as well as changes in product sales mix and lower cost of raw materials. Excluding distributor termination costs of $12.2 million and transaction expenses of $11.5 million, operating expenses for the 2015 second quarter were $166.1 million as compared to $161.9 million in the same quarter last year, excluding termination costs of $0.5 million and transaction costs of $1.1 million. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding these items were 23.9% for the 2015 second quarter as compared to 23.6% in the same quarter last year. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 4.1% for the 2015 second quarter compared to 4.4% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.4% compared to 10.5% in the same quarter a year ago. Commissions and royalties in the quarter were lower, partly offset by a $1.6 million provision for marketing funds for the new Coca-Cola energy business and an increase of $3.6 million in sponsorships and endorsements. General and administrative costs excluding distributor termination costs and the transaction costs as a percentage of net sales for the 2015 second quarter were 9.5% as compared to 8.6% for the corresponding quarter last year. This increase was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses of $8.4 million, due to additional payroll taxes paid by the company following the exercise of certain stock options by senior management, as well as the addition of certain employees to manage and service the new strategic brands. Stock-based compensation, a non-cash item, was $8.5 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared to $8.1 million in the same quarter last year. Payroll taxes were $6.4 million for the second quarter of 2015 as compared to $1.6 million last year in the same quarter, an increase of $4.8 million. Total transactional costs related to The Coca-Cola transactions during the second quarter were $11.5 million as compared to $1.1 million in the comparable quarter in 2014. Gross sales to customers outside of the United States were $187.2 million in the 2015 second quarter compared to $180.2 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $151.3 million in the 2015 second quarter compared to $148 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014. Foreign exchange movements had an unfavorable impact on gross sales of approximately $29.9 million and on net sales of approximately $23.9 million. Included in gross sales to customers outside the United States are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transhipped to the military and their customers overseas. According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through July 25, 2015 for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including shots increased by 10.3% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 10% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 14.9% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 0.2%. Sales of Red Bull increased 14.1%, sales of Rockstar increased by 13%, sales of 5-Hour increased 2.1% and sales of Amp decreased 5.8%. According to Nielsen for the four-weeks ended July 25, 2015, sales in the convenience and gas channel including energy shots in dollars increased 10.7% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 9.1% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 11.5% and Full Throttle sales decreased 0.9%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 13.5%, Rockstar was up 21.7%, 5-Hour was up 4.8% and Amp was up 0.4%. According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended July 25, 2015, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel including energy shots in dollars increased by 0.5 points over the same period last year to 34.2%. NOS' share remained the same at 3.8% and Full Throttle's share decreased 0.1 points to 1%. Red Bull share increased 0.9 points to 36.3%. Rockstar share was up 0.7 points at 7.6%. 5-Hour share was lower at 8.6% and Amp's share decreased 0.2 points to 2.2%. According to Nielsen for the four weeks ended July 25, 2015, sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 9.6% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 10.9% higher than the same period last year, while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy was 9.1% higher. According to Nielsen in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended June 27, 2015, the energy drink category increased 5%. Monster sales were up 6% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 1.4 points to 27.8% over the same period last year. Red Bull sales increased 3% and its market share decreased 0.8 points to 38.2%. Rockstar sales increased 37% and its market share increased 4.1 points to 19.2%. According to Nielsen for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 20.4% in the month of June 2015. Monster sales increased 1.1%. Our market share decreased 6.2 points to 32.2% against the comparable period last year. Our strategic brands market share represented by Burn increased 0.3 points to 6.2%. Gladiator has been discontinued in Mexico. Red Bull sales increased 4.3% and its market share decreased by 3.2 points to 20.9%. VIVE 100's market share increased 7.8 points to 21.7%, while Boost's market share decreased 0.2 points to 14.2%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. In the month prior, which is May 2015, for example, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 28.7% in the month and Monster's sales increased 25.6%. Our market share decreased 0.9 points to 35.3% against the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales decreased 0.8% and its market share decreased by 6.1 points to 20.4%. Vive 100's market share increased 6.5 points to 19.6%, while Boost's market share decreased 1.8 points to 13.9%. Coke's market share represented by Burn and Gladiator together increased 1.1 points to 6.2%. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended June 2015, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew some 10.5% to 12.4% in Great Britain, from 15.8% to 18.7% in France, and from 7.6% to 11.5% in Germany. In the same period, Monster's value share grew from 7.9% to 8.7% in Sweden, from 8.2% to 8.8% in Belgium, and from 5.9% to 6% in the Netherlands. Monster's retail market share in value for the 13-weeks ended June 2015, as compared to the same period last year decreased from 18.7% to 16.8% in South Africa and from 22.4% to 21.9% in Spain, and from 11.7% to 11.2% in Italy. All three of these markets had independent distributors. According to IRI, Monster's market share in Greece increased for the 13-weeks to the end of June 2015 from 25.4% to 27.8%. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country-to-country. According to Nielsen, for the month of May 2015 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 15.6% as compared to 11.3% last year. And in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of June 2015 declined from 5.3% to 3.9% as compared to the same period last year. We believe that our distributor in Brazil has lost focus on our brand as a result of The Coca-Cola transaction. According to INTAGE, which provides tracking and market statistics in Japan, for the month of June 2015 in the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 24.1% to 32.7%. Additionally, within the last few weeks, Monster launched its Monster Energy Ultra energy drink in Japan. Early indications are very positive. As stated earlier, the company has revised its reportable segments into Finished Products, Concentrate, and Other. Net sales for the Finished Products segment or the DSD segment, but excluding Peach Tea, increased 1.2% to $651.2 million, and operating income for the Finished Products segment before taking into account corporate and unallocated amounts decreased 1.1% to $251.6 million in the 2015 second quarter. Net sales for the Finished Products segment were negatively impacted by approximately $22.8 million of foreign currency movements, and operating income for the Finished Products segment was negatively impacted by approximately $12.2 million of distributed terminations. Net sales for the company's new Concentrate segment were $13 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015, and operating income before taking into account corporate and unallocated amounts for the Concentrate segment was $9.1 million. You will appreciate that that covers the period only – between the closing of the transaction and the end of the quarter, which is not a full quarter. Net sales for the company's third segment, Other, decreased 32.6% to $29.5 million for the three months ended June 2015 from $43.8 million for the same period ending June 30, 2014. The 2015 second quarter's results for the Other segment are through June 12, the date The Coca-Cola transaction closed. Operating income for the Other segment before taking into account corporate and unallocated amounts and excluding the gain on the sale of our non-energy business was $2.2 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared to $3.1 million in the second quarter of 2014. Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the second quarter of 2015 in dollars were 4.8% higher than the same period last year. In local currencies, net sales in the region were 32% higher than in the same period last year. Gross sales were 10% higher in dollars and 38% higher in local currencies. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increase market share in Europe. However, growth in Spain, South Africa, and Italy were negatively impacted due to the uncertainty regarding the impact of The Coca-Cola transaction. Overall, EMEA is now operating well, and we've made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and in-store execution and traded profitably in the second quarter. We are continuing to see the benefit of the strategic changes implemented over the past two years. The Monster Energy Valentino Rossi drink, which is now available in the majority of the markets in Europe and South Africa continues to perform well. During the quarter, we launched Mega Monster in additional EMEA markets. Results continue to be positive. In particular, in Great Britain, Germany, Greece, Sweden, Ireland, Hungary and Poland, Monster achieved sales gains and continued to increase its market share. In our international markets where our distribution partners anticipated transition occurring, there is a notable difference in our sales levels versus our markets that are already operating in The Coca-Cola system. Net sales in Asia Pacific increased 28.7%, a 49.9% increase in local currencies versus the comparable quarter last year, while net sales in Mexico, Central and South America, and the Caribbean decreased 3.5% in dollars but increased 5.8% in local currencies over the comparable period in 2014 mainly due to foreign exchange differences, a competitive price adjustment in Chile to offset an indirect tax, and continuing issues with our Colombian distributor. Sales in Brazil for the second quarter were disappointing, as referred to earlier. In Japan, net sales increased by 41.8% in dollars and 66.5% in local currency. In Mexico, net sales were flat both in local currency and dollars. Both Japan and Mexico contributed meaningful operating profits to the division in the second quarter of 2015. India has been impacted by losses in the second quarter following regulatory issues which are currently being addressed. We're actively involved in discussions with prospective Coca-Cola bottlers in numerous countries around the world regarding distribution opportunities for our Monster Energy drinks. We are also evaluating many additional local production opportunities with Coca-Cola bottlers which we believe will yield cost reductions. We have experienced a decrease in sales of Muscle Monster that we believe is principally attributable to a quality issue relating to the texture of our Muscle Monster products. I did mention this on our previous call. We have addressed the issue by reformulating those products and are currently shipping new Muscle Monster products with new graphics to our distributors. Following the confirmation of the transactions with The Coca-Cola Company, the company received substantial cash funds. The Board of Directors is considering options with regard to the return of capital, including share repurchases. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $1.7 billion compared to $370.3 million at December 31, 2014. Short-term investments were $1.2 billion compared to $781.1 million at December 31, 2014. Long-term investments increased to $52.4 million from $42.9 million at December 31, 2014. Included in short- and long-term investments are auction rate securities of $3.2 million. Days outstanding for account receivables were 42.6 days at June 30, 2015, and 36.4 days at December 31, 2014, compared to 43.5 days at June 30, 2014. Inventories increased to $180.9 million from $174.6 million December 31, 2014. Average days of inventory was 54.4 days at June 30, 2015, which was lower than the 37.4 days of inventory at December 31, 2014, and lower than the 60.8 days at June 30, 2014. In the fall, we are planning to launch a new Juice Monster called Pipeline Punch and a new banana-flavored Muscle Monster as well as Monster Ultra Black as a permanent SKU. We have also reformulated our Rojo Tea + Energy Rehab product as a Raspberry Tea + Energy product, which is currently in the process of being introduced. We have additional new product launches planned for the beginning of 2016. Our repositioned Juice Monster and Punch Monster lines continue to show healthy gains. Gross sales in July 2015 in dollars were approximately 14.1% higher than in July 2014. In local currencies, gross sales in July were 19.2% higher than in July 2014. July 2014 included the old Warehouse division and Peace Tea. Specifically, the Finished Product segment, which comprises our Monster Energy brand products, grew 10.2% in July in dollars and 14.5% without a foreign exchange impact. We caution again that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. We are pleased that The Coca-Cola transaction closed on June 12 and are excited with the opportunity this presents to the company. North American and international gross margins are healthy and, in fact, have continued to improve. The U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that the energy category continues to grow. We believe that the majority of the increases in dollar values achieved by Red Bull are attributable to their price increase which they implemented in January. In units, sales of Red Bull in the United States increased by 5.5%, which is lower than the 9.1% increase in units achieved by Monster. We think that the resilience shown by consumers to Red Bull's increased pricing augurs well for our planned price increase in September. Importantly, on a unit basis, Monster continues to outperform Red Bull this year, which we believe is significant. The new additions to the Monster family that were introduced last year continue to gain market share and add to the company's sales. We believe that our Monster Ultra lines and additions and changes to our Rehab and Juice Monster lines will continue to add to sales. Turning to international markets, we are pleased with the performance of our international expansion, particularly in Japan, Great Britain, Germany, France, Sweden, Ireland, Greece, and Chile. We are pleased with the improvement in July in our sales growth. I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Hi, everyone.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: Hello, Judy.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So if I look at your second quarter international trends, and I think you talked about local currency growth in some of the markets like EMEA and Japan, it actually looks very healthy despite some of the transition issues that you called out in a few of the markets. So, number one, can you just talk about what's driving some of that underlying improvement? Maybe it's the Coke System doing better or it's some of the new markets you're entering? And then even the improvement that you saw in July, what's driving that? And then the markets that you're having some challenges, like Brazil and Italy and maybe even other markets that were having discussions about the transition, can you elaborate on how much progress you're making? What are some of the early learnings as you're talking to these bottlers and thinking about the pace in which you can transition some of the bottlers to the Coke System? Thanks.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: Let me take the last question first. In many of these markets, it's not a question of what we can do. The question is, you've got existing distributors and bottlers who obviously have heard about the Coke transaction and believe that their territories will ultimately be transitioned to Coke. So what they've generally have really pulled back on their investments in their markets, in investing in putting extra effort. And although we've tried to obviously work with them and assure them and it effects their buyout to some extent, they really mentally are not in the same place as they were when they were fully engaged as our full-time distributors. So the challenge we've got is in basically being able to conclude arrangements with the Coke bottlers as soon as possible to transition those markets. And we've referred to that there is a learning curve with the international Coke bottlers, not only from a point of view of learning about our products, but the way we go to the market, the way we operate, the terms of our agreements using a Finished Product model, all of these things are not usual generally to the Coke bottlers. They have very different business models and existing contractual relationships with The Coca-Cola Company. So there are some complex issues both with regard to the legal terms of the agreements and the economics and working out the value chains. And these are being done and attended to and we are having these discussions, but it is taking some time. And unfortunately, we've just got to be patient. But what we do clearly see is there is a very big difference in both our sales in and sales out from distributors to please their depletions in markets where they are what we call non-transition markets where the distributors know that they are going to stay with the brand, for example, the Coke, the CCR markets in Europe. Those markets are generally performing well and performing at a much higher level than the markets where there is a likelihood of a transition. There are some markets, on the other hand, where we've not made a decision to transition, and we've communicated that and been able to assure our distributor. Those markets are performing well, particularly you call out a market like Japan where our partner has – we've talked with them and we're focused on continuing to operate with them and there, the market has done very well and they are continuing to perform fully. That is in international. I mean that is not a dissimilar situation in the U.S. If you take our markets in the U.S. with it in some cases, in most cases, our existing Coke bottlers, but in some cases we have some independent bottlers here, distributors or bottlers. And, again, you're seeing a clear difference between the results of both our sales in and the sales in were obviously also affected by the lower stock holding levels held by Coke bottlers versus the AB, the new ones we've gone to here. That was an additional factor. But even if you take that into account or put it to the side for the moment, when you look at the depletions by the Coke bottlers in the transition territories, the depletions are lower than in the same company's non-transition territories. And it's clear that what's going on is that there is a learning curve. There were some out of stocks both from our side and in retail, but it's also a learning curve because the new sales teams have basically got to learn the Monster business, the velocities, those accounts that are higher in velocity don't necessarily replicate the accounts that are higher in velocity for traditional beverages. And so we think that that's a transitory thing and this is the quarter where they've gone through it. It's the first 90 days of the transition to the Coke System in the U.S. And so we think these are things that are just going to have to work their way out of it. And we believe we're starting to see improvements and some of that is now being reflected in the numbers that we're showing in our sales numbers for July. But obviously what you also can see is, if you look at the Nielsen over this whole period, the Nielsen numbers in the U.S. have been pretty consistent on our sales out in units, et cetera, which shows that from the consumer point of view, there is still similar retail pull in all these markets.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, hey. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi, Mark.
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I guess just two questions. One is sort of a follow up on the last one. If you could talk maybe about directionally, did the July number benefit from restock? Or did you see more of that in, call it, months of May and June, and so the July number is more of a representation of demand? I guess you could see that from the scanner data, but maybe if you could give us a bit of commentary on that, that'd be helpful. And then secondly on cash, I appreciate your commentary from a board standpoint, but $3 billion in cash is obviously an awful lot. So what prevents you from going into the market, call it, Monday, Tuesday, whenever the window opens up next week, to buy back a lot of stock? Or how should we sort of think about the share repurchases? Is it going to be in open market for some period of time? Will there be an ASR tender? If you could just sort of help us directionally on that, that'd be great too. Thank you.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary, Monster Beverage Corp.: Well, Mark, if I could answer that question on cash there, there will be a return of cash to shareholders. The board is meeting tomorrow and it's one of the issues that will be tabled on the board meeting. And I can't say what route the board will take, but there are certainly a number of options open to the board and they will make their decision in due course.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: Yeah. It's obviously clear that we have the excess cash, and we will address it, but we need to address it in due course. There are a number of reasons as to what we need to do or how to do it and we will look at that, Mark. It's just premature at the moment. I know everybody is keen to get us to deal with it and address it, but it just has to be dealt with in due course.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary, Monster Beverage Corp.: And then your first question was about the July sales and I think there's a general view here that the stock reductions are past us and that the July sales really are a factor of demand. And that's a view, it's not something that one can take to the bank but it's certainly the view that we hold here.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: Yeah. And we also think that that's being influenced by the fact that, again, some of that learning curve is now improving and some of the out of stocks that initially occurred because of unknown order patterns for different products in our line which has quite a lot of products. Those things have – we think those are normalizing and we think that that is more indicative of our regular business.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary, Monster Beverage Corp.: And we have been having regular meetings with The Coca-Cola bottlers in the U.S. and these issues are being addressed.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: Hi.
Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Only two questions. One, could you talk about what portion of your non-U.S. sales are going through non-Coca-Cola distributors at this time? And what's the level of decline with those? Any sort of help that would be great. And the second one is in non-U.S. markets where Coca-Cola does not have a contractual obligation to partner with you, unlike the U.S. market, are you seeing greater difficulty? Or it's just going through the process of finding out terms and conditions that are acceptable to both the parties?
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: I think there is a general excitement amongst all of the Coke bottlers to take on Monster and to partner with us. And I think it's right through the Coke. I think there's a very good attitude throughout the Coke System. I think the issue is – as I indicated earlier, it's getting to be able to get them comfortable with the basis on which we do business which is different to the traditional Concentrate sort of model business that Coke has followed for centuries. And to get them to understand us and work through the legal issues such that we're getting through value chain issues. And generally to the extent that we've worked with them, they're all comfortable with the value chain issues that there are satisfactory ways in which we can work to share the issue and they're excited by that. It's a positive for them. But we obviously have to negotiate and get through everybody, trying to muscle each other at the moment to take a position which will obviously be (38:30) going forward. So we're just having to work through those issues. But we are hopeful that we'll get through in most of them. And if to the extent that we don't in any particular territory, we have options that we can go to. We have existing distributors, and a lot of the issues we are having with existing distributors if we were to not transition a territory and go back to those distributors and basically assure them that or give them a longer term contract and give them the assurance that they will have a longer term, that they have a number of years secured, we've got no doubt they will start to reinvest and re-engage in the brand. It's just that we've not been able to do that because we haven't wanted to mislead them or give them any false hopes. And so that's been the delicate tightrope we've been walking at the moment. So again, it doesn't mean that in every territory we will go to a Coke bottler. But I don't think that that is an issue. The issue at the moment is just getting everybody and it's time to deal in all these different countries and get everybody on the same page and get them comfortable with us. We are making progress. And we obviously are going to try and step up the pace of those negotiations.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary, Monster Beverage Corp.: Yeah. I think I just wanted to add that the decisions that will be made for international distribution will be decisions that will be the best for Monster, for our company, and that will be assessed following the negotiations, the value chains, legal issues and other opportunities which we may have.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: Now, on the percentages, I would say that probably got the – probably pretty much the majority of our sales are with existing Coke bottlers internationally, pretty close to half, and if you look at the numbers in many places other than Japan which is an exception, in other places you've got sales very much down and Chile is also a good market as well in that sense. These bottlers are working well with the distributor, but in Brazil particularly it's been very disappointing. They're just really not engaged and some of the wholesalers they work with seem to have disengaged as well. And then in some of the markets which are non-Coke bottlers, when I say we're up, it's marginal, it's almost flat versus really nice healthy gains across the Coke bottler markets. So there is a very big distinction between those markets. But as to the percentage, I'm just guessing. I just don't have a number in my head or available at this point in time.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary, Monster Beverage Corp.: More than 50 billion is probably a good... (41:24)
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: Yeah. And then the one distributor that did perform pretty well, which was a distributor in Germany, they also did perform reasonably well until we changed over, but that was quite a large volume market which have now changed to Coke. And in the first month there, we've been very satisfied with the result. It's been very positive.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary, Monster Beverage Corp.: And in Mexico, the July sales were actually very good.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: And I should put Mexico into the same category as Japan and Chile. The distributor still continues to perform well. Some of the major problems markets are the ones I did allude to earlier. Thanks.
Operator: And our last question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan Stanley (sic) [Securities] (42:10). Your line is now open.
John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Two quick questions here. The first is, and I apologize if you gave this in the numbers. Did you talk about the underlying growth of the acquired Coke brands in terms of how you think they're doing? And will the bottlers view them as reinvigorated as you take over responsibility for or ownership for them? And then secondly, I had a question on the gross margin. Given the regional mix with weaker U.S. and stronger international, the gross margin was still up a lot. Any thoughts in terms of what's driving the gross margin expansion? Thanks.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: Gross margin generally has probably been affected a little bit by the Concentrate division, which is the strategic brands which have higher gross margins. And we've just been able to achieve some lower costs, which we indicated, in our brands even though there is a balance between international and domestic. But what had happened is I think our international margins have also improved on this quarter versus previous quarters. So while they are perhaps a little bit lower than our domestic margins, the improvement in those margins have had an effect and have helped push up our overall margins.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary, Monster Beverage Corp.: And what we said earlier on the call, John, was that there were higher gross margins because in the Finished Products segment, which is largely a function of product sales mix and lower cost of certain raw materials. So we did refer to that earlier on in the call.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: So could you repeat your first question, John? Hello?
John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Can you hear me?
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: Sorry, no. Can you repeat your first question?
John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Sure. So the first question was about the Coke energy brands that you acquired and what the underlying trends were for those businesses in July and whether the bottlers feel more reinvigorated given the fact that you are going to be probably providing a greater level of focus on those brands.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary, Monster Beverage Corp.: I just want to remind everyone that the Concentrate business was only in for two weeks in the quarter. We closed the transaction on the 12th, which is a Friday. From the 15th to the end of the month, the Concentrate sales were incorporated in the financial results for this quarter. So turning to July, I don't have those numbers for July. I think we had them earlier for the Concentrate division.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: I think the sales for the Concentrate division or the brands have been a little choppy but it's been very early. We only got the brands recently. We then didn't have access to a lot of the underlying marketing information about the brands until we closed. We're still getting information and trying to understand the brands. We have marketing guys working with us. Some of the people we took on from Coke but some of our own guys are having to travel to different markets to try and understand the brands. And we're still trying to put together our strategy on these brands. Obviously, we've talked with the Coke guys and we've reassured them that we're going to obviously focus on these brands and give these brands attention. And at the moment, I think they're doing fine, but I can't give you an indication of direction because it really just is too premature.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary, Monster Beverage Corp.: Yeah, I'm just looking at the numbers we have. We don't have them with us as to what happened in July with the Concentrate business last year. We know obviously what it was this year but we don't have it here.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: I think we're just going to have to just spend some time before we start giving more direction. I mean, they are continuing to upgrade pretty decently in most markets. There are a couple of individual markets where the bottlers were sort of not happy and we've seen them want to discontinue some of the brands in some small markets and small brands. Like I mentioned earlier that they decided to discontinue Gladiator in Mexico and then Samurai was discontinued in the Philippines, which was a low-priced brand there. But by and large, the markets are fine. And the most important markets are actually the U.S. with NOS. And we feel the brand is good. It has slowed a little bit. We think there may have been a little bit of a pulling back on some of the marketing spend behind the brand. But we believe in the brand and the bottlers in the U.S. also believe in the brand and I think we can obviously make that brand grow. So we are positive about the NOS brand going forward. And we think that there is a role for Full Throttle in the portfolio as well.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO & Secretary, Monster Beverage Corp.: NOS has increased actually in the 12 weeks that we mentioned earlier as well in all outlets combined by 14.9%. So sales of Full Throttle were down 0.2% and the overall market was up by 10.3%. So NOS grew in excess of the market.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: Yeah. So that continues to perform and we're excited about that – the NOS brand. And there are a number of the brands that we really see as very good opportunities around the world in the portfolio. Thank you very much.
Rodney Cyril Sacks - Chairman, Chief & Principal Executive Officer, Monster Beverage Corp.: On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continue to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. We are particularly excited by the new opportunities that we have going forward with a robust portfolio of energy drink products throughout the world comprised of our Monster Energy drink line together with the newly acquired strategic brands. We believe that our agreement with The Coca-Cola Company will enable us to focus on our core energy business while leveraging the strength of The Coca-Cola Company's powerful distribution and bottling system on a worldwide scale. Thank you very much for your attendance.

Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed March 2, 2015, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements, for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated May 7, 2015. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. As previously disclosed, in August 2014, Monster Beverage Corporation and The Coca-Cola Company entered into definitive agreements for a long-term strategic partnership that we believe will accelerate growth for Monster in the global Energy Drink category. Under the agreements, The Coca-Cola Company will acquire an approximate 16.7% ownership interest in Monster, following the issuance of shares to The Coca-Cola Company, and will transfer ownership of its worldwide Energy business to Monster, which, in turn, will transfer its non-Energy business to The Coca-Cola Company. The Coca-Cola Company and its bottlers will become Monster's preferred distribution partner globally, and Monster will become The Coca-Cola Company's exclusive energy play. We believe that this partnership will strategically align both companies for the long term by combining the strength of The Coca-Cola Company's worldwide bottling system with Monster's dedicated focus and expertise as a leading energy player globally. We are actively engaged both in preparations for and the implementation of the contemplated arrangements. As previously reported, all necessary approvals and consents from the relevant antitrust authorities around the world have been obtained. In anticipation of the closing of the transactions, to date, Monster has transitioned approximately 84% of its targeted distribution rights in the U.S. to The Coca-Cola Company and its bottling partners, and an additional 5% will be transitioned during May 2015. Thus far, such transitions were accomplished with only minor interruptions, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the many persons involved in the transition, both on Monster's and Coke's respective teams. We've also commenced negotiations with certain international Coca-Cola Bottlers with a view to transitioning distribution rights for Monster Energy to such Bottlers after the closing. While the closing of the transactions is subject to customary closing conditions, we anticipate closing the transactions early in June 2015. We are excited by the addition of The Coca-Cola Company Energy brands to our Monster Energy portfolio, which will provide us with complementary product offerings in many countries, access to new geographies as well as access to new channels, including vending and specialty accounts. As previously communicated, we plan to review all options available after the transactions close and we receive the funds due to the company in terms of the agreements to return cash to our shareholders. Turning to the first quarter results. We believe that the first quarter of 2015 was negatively impacted domestically by events relating to the closing of the transactions and the transitioning of our brands in the U.S. from existing distributors to The Coca-Cola Company and its bottling partners, as well as internationally, due to the uncertainty inherent in the anticipated closing of the transactions. At this time, we cannot quantify what impact the transactions, including the transitions, will have on our second quarter. In addition to our GAAP condensed consolidated statement of income and other information and our GAAP condensed consolidated balance sheet for the company for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, attached to our press release is a non-GAAP adjusted condensed consolidated statement of income and other information adjusting for certain of the selected items discussed in the press release impacting profitability, which we believe should be considered in assessing our performance in the quarter. We believe that it would be helpful to shareholders on this call to address our results on an adjusted basis after giving effect to such items in addition to and not in lieu of our GAAP results. Excluding the acceleration of deferred revenue of $39.8 million, gross sales for the 2015 first quarter were $670.4 million, an increase of 9.2% over gross sales in the comparable first quarter of 2014. Net sales in the 2015 first quarter, as reported, was $626.8 million. Excluding the acceleration of deferred revenue, net sales for the 2015 first quarter were $587 million, 9.5% higher than net sales of $536.1 million in the same period last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of approximately $15 million on gross sales and approximately $12 million on net sales. After adjustment for the acceleration of deferred revenue, gross profit as a percentage of net sales were 56.1% as compared to 53.5% for the comparable 2014 first quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to changes in product sales mix, lower cost of certain sweeteners and other raw materials as well as an increase in production efficiencies. Excluding distributed termination costs of $206 million, operating expenses for the 2015 first quarter were $155.3 million as compared to $138.0 million in same quarter last year. Excluding both the acceleration of deferred revenue and distributed termination costs, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the 2015 first quarter were 26.5% as compared to 25.7% in the same quarter last year. We are continuing to work towards reducing our overall operating costs in our international markets. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales, excluding acceleration of deferred revenue, were 4.4% for the 2015 first quarter compared to 4.7% in the same quarter last year. Excluding acceleration of deferred revenue, selling expenses, although higher in dollars, as a percentage of net sales, were 10.6% compared to 10.7% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase in selling expenses was primarily due to a $3.7 million increase in cost of premiums and a $3.7 million increase in sponsorships. TDM and MAT program costs were lower during the quarter. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for the 2015 first quarter, excluding the acceleration of deferred revenues and distributed termination costs of $206 million, were 11.4% as compared to 10.3% for the corresponding quarter last year. Operating income after adjustment for acceleration of deferred revenue and distributed termination costs would have been 16.8% higher at $173.8 million as compared to $148.9 million in the same period last year. Excluding the acceleration of deferred revenue and distributed termination costs on a tax effective basis, net income would have increased by 13.9% to $108.5 million from $95.3 million in the same quarter last year. Excluding acceleration deferred revenue as well as distributed termination cost, the effective tax rate for the 2015 first quarter would have been approximately 38.1%. The effective tax rate for the 2015 first quarter adjusted for the previously discussed items was higher than in the comparable quarter last year primarily due to a decrease in the company's domestic production deduction due to the exercise of certain stock options. Excluding acceleration of deferred revenue as well as distributed termination costs on a tax effective basis, earnings would have increased to $0.62 per diluted share, 13.8% higher than $0.55 per diluted share earned in the comparable quarter in 2014. Results for the 2015 first quarter continue to be impacted by expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sales of the company's Monster Energy brand Energy Drinks. Such expenses were $4.9 million in the first quarter of 2015. Stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $6.4 million for the first quarter of 2015 compared to $7 million for the same quarter last year. Professional services and other transactional costs related to the Coca-Cola transaction was $3.6 million. Also, additional payroll taxes of $7.2 million were incurred following the exercise of certain stock options. If in addition to making the adjustments discussed earlier, professional service costs relating to the Coca-Cola transaction and the additional payroll taxes are excluded from operating costs, operating income would have been $184.6 million, 24% higher than operating income earned in the first quarter of 2014. On that same basis, net income on a tax effective basis would have been $115.2 million or 21% higher than net income for the first quarter of 2014, while earnings per diluted share would have been $0.66 per diluted share, 20.9% higher than earnings per diluted share of $0.55 for the same quarter in 2014. The effective regulatory-related expenses on earnings per share is approximately $0.02 per diluted share in the quarter. Note also, there was a foreign exchange impact of net sales of approximately $12 million. Gross sales to customers outside of the United States were $141 million in the 2015 first quarter compared to $144.3 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $113 million in the 2015 first quarter compared to $115.8 million in the corresponding quarter in 2014. As stated earlier, gross sales and net sales to customers outside the United States were higher in local currencies by approximately $15 million and $12 million, respectively. Included in geographic sales reported are our sales for the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transhipped to the military and their customers overseas. According to Nielsen report, for the 13 weeks through April 25, 2015, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the Energy Drink category, including Shots, increased by 9.7% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 9% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased 13.7%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 8.8%; sales of 5-Hour increased by 0.4%; and AMP decreased 12.2%. Sales of NOS increased 28.3%; and sales of Full Throttle increased 4.3%. According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended April 25, 2015, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased 10.3% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 7.3% over the same period last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 16.5%. NOS was up 21.8%; Rockstar was up 13.2%; 5-Hour was up 1.3%; and AMP was down 17%. We do want to point out that increased processing as well as the trading-up of SKUs of their flavor extensions by Red Bull to 12-ounce had the effect of increasing revenues per unit sold for Red Bull. We have assessed the increase in Red Bull processing that has took effect earlier this year, and we will be taking up processing of our products later this year. According to Nielsen, in the 5 weeks ended April 25, 2015, Monster's market share of Energy Drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, decreased by 1.0 points over the same period last year to 34.4% against Red Bull's share, which increased 1.9 points to 36.6%. Rockstar's share was up point -- 0.2 points at 7.2%; 5-Hour's share was lower at 8.5%, while NOS' was higher at 3.9%. According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended April 25, 2015, sales of Energy + Coffee Drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 11.8% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 8.5% higher than the same period last year, while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy was 17.1% higher. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended April 4, 2015, the Energy Drink category increased 3%. Monster sales were down 5% versus a year ago. I just want to point out that we are cycling on a lot of innovation that we introduced the first quarter last year. Our market share decreased 2.2 points to 26.1% over the same period last year. Red Bull sales increased 4%, and its market share increased 0.4 points to 37.5%. Rockstar's sales increased 26%, and its market share increased to 2.5 points to 13.7%. Another note is that it's just timing of promotions. We will be embarking on quite an extensive promotional campaign during the second trimester. Some of our competitors' promotions this year were slotted in the first trimester. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the Energy Drink category grew 17.2% in the month of March 2015. Monster sales decreased 2.5%. Our market share decreased 6.5 points to 32.1% against the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales decreased 9.5%, and its market share decreased by 5.9 points to 20%. Vive 100's market share increased 11.6 points to 20.9%, while Boost's market share decreased 2.2 points to 14.3%. Coke's market share represented by Burn and Gladiator together increased 0.6 points to 7.7%. Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more Energy Drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended March 2015, the actual 13-week periods vary by few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 10.1% to 12.1% in Great Britain; from 17.8% to 18.5% in France; from 8% to 10.7% in Germany; from 7.5% to 8.2% in Belgium. In the same period, Monster's value share grew from 7.8% to 9.2% in Sweden; from 5% to 5.6% in the Netherlands; and from 21.2% to 21.3% in Spain. Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ended February 2015 as compared to the same period last year decreased from 19.3% to 17.3% in South Africa. According to IRI, Monster's market share increased for the 13 weeks to the end of March 2015 from 25.2% to 29.3% in Greece. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, for the month of March 2015 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 15.3% as compared to 9.4% last year. And in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of March 2015, grew from 4.3% to 4.7% as compared to the same period last year. According to INTAGE, which provides tracking and market statistics in Japan, for the month of March 2015 in the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 28% to 33.8%. Excluding the acceleration of deferred revenue and the distributed termination costs, net sales for the DSD segment increased 10% to $566 million, and contribution margin for the DSD segment increased 20.1% to $223.9 million from $186.5 million in the 2014 first quarter. Net sales for our DSD segment were negatively impacted by approximately $12 million due to foreign currency movement. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment decreased 3.6% to $21 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2015, from $21.8 million for the same period in 2014. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was negative by $0.04 -- I'm sorry, by $4 million -- $0.04 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $0.3 million in the first quarter positive of 2014. Net sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa in the first quarter of 2015 in dollars were 2% lower than the same period last year. In local currencies, net sales in the region were 14.7% higher than in the same period last year. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increase market share in Europe, in particular, in Great Britain, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Greece. Monster achieved sales gains and continue to increase its market share. Overall, our Western European and African divisions are now operating well, and we have made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and in-store execution. We are continuing to see the benefit of the strategic changes implemented at the end of 2013 and in 2014. Our EMEA division traded profitably during the first quarter. The Monster Energy Valentino Rossi drink, which is now available in the majority of markets in Europe and South Africa, continues to perform well as a permanent SKU and was launched in 5 additional markets in the first quarter of 2015. During the quarter, we also launched Mega Monster, a resealable 553 ml SKU of our original Monster Green Energy drink in a number of EMEA markets. Early indications show positive sales contribution from Mega Monster. Net sales in Asia-Pacific decreased 9.5% in dollars but increased 1% in local currencies versus the comparable quarter last year. While net sales in South America decreased 15%, 6.2% in local currencies over the comparable period in 2014. Mainly due to foreign exchange differences, a competitor price adjustment in Chile to offset an indirect tax and issues with our Colombian distributor, sales also decreased in Brazil ahead of the anticipated closing of the Coca-Cola transactions although our market share in March increased for Nielsen. In Japan, net sales increased 11% in local currency. Japan contributed meaningful operating profits in the first quarter of 2015. In Mexico, net sales increased 35% in dollars. Similarly, Mexico contributed meaningful operating profits in the first quarter of 2015. We are continuing with our expansion strategy in international markets but have deferred proposed launches in certain countries in the -- for the future following the strategic partnership that we are entering into with The Coca-Cola Company. We will address the implementation of such deferred launches following the closing of the transactions. We are continuing with our strategy to secure local production in certain of our international markets in order to improve gross margins, reduce freight, reduce damages and assist in mitigating the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. We believe that our partnership with The Coca-Cola Company may result in additional local production opportunities for us and may accelerate our local production strategy. Our original Monster Green Energy Drink continued to perform well and experienced good growth as did our entire Ultra product line. Unfortunately, we experienced a quality issue relating to the texture of our Muscle Monster product line. This issue has been addressed, and the line has been reformulated. We are refreshing the packaging of that line as well. As a result, however, sales at Muscle Monster during the quarter was substantially lower than the first quarter of last year and, obviously, negatively impacted our sales. During the 2015 first quarter, no share purchases were made under the board-authorized share repurchase program. However, 20 -- I'm sorry, 2.2 million shares were purchased from employees during the quarter in lieu of cash payments for options exercised or withholding tax as due. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $362.8 million compared to $370.3 million at December 31, 2014. Short-term investments were $647.3 million compared to $781.1 million at December 31, 2014. Long-term investments decreased to $41.2 million from $42.9 million at December 31, 2014. Included in short- and long-term investments are auction rate securities of $3.9 million. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were at 46.4 days at March 31, 2015, and 36.4 days at December 31, 2014, compared to 48.1 days at March 31, 2014. Inventories increased to $197.9 million from $174.6 million at December 31, 2014. Average days of inventory was 69.1 days at March 31, 2015, which was higher than the 57.4 days of inventory at December 31, 2014, and lower than the 73.7 days at March 31, 2014. We have now launched Ultra Citron, our fruity SKU in the Ultra product line and Rehab Peach Tea + Energy, which have been well received by consumers. Our repositioned juice and punch products continue to show healthy gains. We are planning to launch additional products later in 2015, but it is premature for us to discuss those products at this time. We believe that the transitioning of a substantial majority of our targeted distribution rights in the U.S., effective April 6, 2015, orders by the Coca-Cola system to implement the transitions, the accounting for returns from terminated distributors, the timing of the transitions as well as uncertainty with our independent international distributors given the imminent implementation of the transaction, are among the factors that impacted our sales levels in March and April 2015. It is premature for us to finalize our April sales and to comment thereon at this time. In conclusion, I'd like to summarize the recent positive points. North American and international gross margins are healthy. Our 2015 first quarter gross margins in North America as well as internationally generally were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2014. U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that the Energy category continues to grow. The new additions to the Monster family that were introduced during 2014 continue to gain market share and contribute positively to the overall increase in the company's sales. Our repositioned Punch Monster and Juice Monster lines have been positively received by distributors and consumers, and both distribution and sales of those lines continue to improve. We believe that our Monster Unleaded, Ultra Sunrise and Ultra Citron lines as well as was Rehab Peach Tea + Energy will continue to increase their contribution to sales through 2015. Turning to international markets. We are pleased with the performance of our international brand expansion, particularly in Japan, Great Britain, Germany, France, Sweden, Denmark, Greece and Chile. We believe that the Coca-Cola transition, particularly a successful transition, will afford us ongoing opportunities in 2015 and beyond. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So I guess just first in terms of the 84% of the volume that you've transitioned to the Coke distribution, just give us a little bit of kind of what you're seeing as you've transitioned. I know you called out some of the disruptions, but are you starting to see some changes in terms of what's happening on the shelves? And you've obviously highlighted the opportunity in the vending and specialty channels. Can we see those channels getting more traction more quickly? And then in international market, it sounds like the disruptions related to just the pending transition is perhaps a little bit more pronounced maybe than the U.S. markets. So can you verify if that is the appropriate reads that we should think about at this point? And are there any sort of any big markets? You're seeing a little bit more of the transition disruption in those international markets?
Rodney C. Sacks: Judy, with your second question first. I think you are correct in that assumption. I think international markets have just been a little more affected. I think there's just a little more skepticism amongst the distributors and anticipation of what the future will be and whether they will continue to be -- distribute the brand. And I think that has affected their investment in the brand, investment in securing distribution and sales and, in general approach, I think in attitude. With regard to the transition to the U.S., we think that the transition has gone relatively smoothly from a retailer point of view. There were a few disruptions, minor where retailers hadn't -- weren't able in time to make changes or the distributor to make changes, so that, in some cases, products being taken into stores were still being shown as being supplied by the previous vendors, so there were some issues. But generally, we thought that the transition went well. But again, a lot of that will only come through to us with time. We've heard of small -- a few instances, but obviously, we don't hear of everything, certainly not in the first few weeks of it taking place. So I think that even to really understand the issues and the opportunities, is going to take some months to pan out and be -- for us to be able to really make more sense of it. Just to comment on any doubtful things, I think would not be sensible and not accurate enough.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel.
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: The first question, the price increase, should we think about that as sort of in line with the mid-single-digit price increase that Red Bull took?
Rodney C. Sacks: I think it's probably going to be similar, yes. I just think that having seen how they've managed this and the effect and the response from the trade and consumers, we think that's probably what we are likely to do. We'll finalize the actual numbers a little later, but we'll do that. We're looking to try and do that early in the fall.
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Okay, great. And then the tax rates, so should we expect also that to go back to where it was trending over the last year or so following this quarter? And then just one sort of broader question...
Rodney C. Sacks: Yes. It's hard for us to determine what the tax rate would be. But we -- there was a -- there was this factor. This was quite a large stock option exercise that might've -- there maybe some that flow through. But then eventually, on a longer-term basis, those will ameliorate quite substantially. That will affect the tax rate. And I think as we continue to settle down and grow international business, both for our own brand as well as the brand, the KO acquired brands, we think that the tax rate will be positively affected. But we -- at this point, we just -- there's too many uncertainties for us to try and point to exactly where that will end up. But we do think we will be able to make some headway in lowering the rate.
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Great. And then just lastly, how are you envisioning international distribution in terms of percent of volume in the Coke system and away from the Coke system? I know it's early, but just sort of how do you think about that?
Rodney C. Sacks: Again, I think that's been really difficult to give you an answer on because it's just taken time to get to meet the international bottlers around the world to assess their appetite, where we will be with them, what their appetite is for the brand. And there are also, obviously, economic issues and factors as to whether we are happy making the change, if -- based on margin requirements and cost requirements. So there are a number of factors, and we are working through those. But the U.S. was an easier transition in -- to do in mass clearly and was the main focus for us to get done. The other focuses, we've been -- to visit them, we've traveled around them, we're starting negotiations with them. But many of them are -- don't know Monster, don't know the system. And it's -- and each negotiation takes on its own course because of different factors that apply in each of these different countries. And this quite varies. There isn't a one formula fits all for the different countries. So that is taking a bit more time, and we're going to have to work our way through it. Obviously, we are looking at that as -- on a positive point of view, we would like to transition substantial amount of that distribution, but that will pan out later in the year over the next 3 to 6 months.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.
Kevin M. Grundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Question on G&A. So OpEx in the quarter was a little bit higher than we had modeled, and I understand there's some noise in there, regulatory professional services, et cetera. Should that normalize? I guess the thinking was you'd get better SG&A leverage, particularly with the top line pretty resilient. Should we be expecting G&A to sort of normalize for the balance of the year? And then with respect to FX, perhaps you could give us a little guidance there. I guess it was about a 2 point headwind in the top line. What are you expecting for the balance of the year?
Rodney C. Sacks: Just on the G&A, I think that the regulatory side will eventually go, but it is there. We're going to see that for a little while still until we resolve some of these -- the pending regulatory matters. With regard to the payroll taxes, again, we think that there may be 1 or 2 quarters, but that generally will also I think regulate -- might disappear and become much more normalized. One of the other costs that we -- or a couple of the other costs that I would just mention, that I did mention, the premiums was high this quarter. What happened was we took premiums into our books in the first quarter. A lot of it designed or earmarked for second quarter premiums. So there was a slight switch in when you're going to see the benefit of it, but is this the right -- we needed to account with an accordance with our policies. Also, in the -- in sponsorships, there was a -- there was an increase, which we think will level out over the year. What -- in certain types of sponsorships, we had allocated these sponsorships over the period of the actual events due to certain changes in the way we -- our contracts with the -- particular events. Now we are amortizing those more spread over the 12-month period. So that had a bit of an effect of increasing costs in the first quarter because a lot of the events start towards -- the annual events start towards the second quarter or earlier than that -- end of the first quarter. We also had an increase in -- we signed an agreement, a sort of major sponsorship with UFC this year, which had the effect of also increasing and coming into the first quarter. So those -- again, we think those will normalize somewhat and probably get us more in line with what we've been going in the future. What we don't know is how those effects will -- those will all be effective once we obviously bring in the KO brands with -- because the whole model for the KO brands will be a concentrate model. There'd be different cost criteria, and that may change things up a little bit.
Hilton H. Schlosberg: And one thing we didn't actually address is the professional services costs related to the Coca-Cola transaction. And of course, that should wind down when the transaction closes.
Rodney C. Sacks: Yes. Absolutely. And then ForEx, perhaps if you'd like to comment on, the floor is yours. Your thoughts on that, Hilton?
Hilton H. Schlosberg: Yes. ForEx, in the quarter, we commented that gross sales we believe were affected by about USD 15 million and the net sales by USD 12 million. And depending on what happens in the subsequent quarters, it's difficult to comment on what those numbers will look like going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Amit Sharma from EMO Capital Markets (sic) [BMO Capital Markets].
Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research: Rodney, if we look like 12 to 18 months in the future and then you look at your international business, what are some of the key markets that you're focusing on? And as we look at the time line of getting traction in those markets, should we assume a normalized time line or a little bit accelerated now that you have a partner of large scale in some of those markets?
Rodney C. Sacks: Well, the major international markets that we sort of already are in the with large enough, and I'd say, major sort of Energy Drink markets are U.K. and Europe, Germany, where we're in now, Spain, so we are -- we're continuing to focus in those markets. Those markets won't -- obviously GB and Spain are with the same Coca-Cola Bottlers. We -- obviously, Germany isn't at the moment, and that will be a decision on -- if and when we change in Germany, which is likely and imminent. The opportunities also in the other big markets, which are sort of -- as a market but we don't know the size of the Energy category for probably premium. The market is very big for -- in Energy, for example, in China, which we've mentioned before, is a really big -- we think is a big future opportunity. But it's in a lower-priced product at the moment. And so whether the premium section and how, where we want to position our brand is still uncertain and we've not come to a final decision. But clearly, that is a market we're going to focus on. We do believe there's good opportunity to grow much more than we have in a market like Brazil, which is also a big market. Obviously Japan, we're doing nicely. And so we're going to try and focus on the larger markets where we're already there. And then obviously, newer markets, we will be -- we will go into, but it wouldn't be as much authority, probably other than China, which we do regard as a priority for us. And we are looking at that and taking steps to actively look at the market and ascertain when we can get into that market. So I think that we will see some benefits, but we just got to get more information and have more time to meet with all the bottlers. That's a pretty gigantic task when you look at -- there are a number of independent bottlers around the world in the Coke system. It's not a matter of getting together with a half a dozen of them. And we are working our way through them at the moment and making good progress. But each country has its own issues. And one of the things that complicate international, which we believe is important for the long term, is we are looking, as in many cases when we're talking to distribution, to the bottlers there, we are also talking to them about production, local production because we believe that will be important to reduce our costs. And then just important to also get them more aligned with us to be real partners and produce locally and -- as well as sell locally. So -- production has its own issues, and we need to deal with those things. That just adds complexity. But ultimately, we'll get there, and we believe it will be in the long-term benefit to do it this way.
Thomas J. Kelly: I mean, that was one of the reasons why we did this transaction was to be able to capitalize on the opportunities that Coca-Cola presents to us through international distribution.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers with UBS.
Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I guess, maybe a follow-up on that just with regards to your progress moving to local production in overseas markets. We've talked a lot about it, and you just mentioned it there. I just was wondering if there's any update to your thinking just given the Coke deal is pending. I guess, specifically, are you now holding back on that transition anywhere where you instead anticipate a move to local production via the Coke system instead of your current...
Rodney C. Sacks: No. It's -- again, it's a mixed bag, and there are clearly more opportunities to get local production through the Coke bottlers that we have talked to and we anticipate talking to. In some countries, we were very advanced in discussions with independent Coke packers to actually pack our products. And in some cases, we need to and we will continue with those arrangements and implement them because a, it'll help secure local production on a -- at a quicker date because it does take some time to get a Coke-packing plant up to speed and to make certain equipment changes that might be necessary or was usually necessary in order to run our products. And in some case in countries, there may well be a need for backup or 2 production plants. So again, it depends on the country. It depends on the circumstances, but there is a really good appetite from the Coke bottlers who are enthusiastic about wanting to do production and -- which is very beneficial for us. So we are reviewing and running down dual policies in some countries where 2 -- the independent packers that we already started on, plus Coke packers, and then in other countries, just looking -- starting from a fresh with Coke -- with the Coke packers or Coke bottlers.
Operator: I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks.
Rodney C. Sacks: Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I would like to thank everyone for their continued interest in our company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continue to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company, both at home and abroad. We are particularly excited by the new opportunities that we are -- that we have going forward with a robust portfolio of Energy Drink products comprised of our Monster Energy Drink line, together with The Coca-Cola Company's energy brands throughout the world. We believe that our agreement with The Coca-Cola Company will enable us to focus on our core Energy business while leveraging the strength of The Coca-Cola Company's powerful distribution and bottling system on a worldwide scale. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Corporation Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2014 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Rodney C. Sacks: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed March 3, 2014 as well as our most recent report on Form 10-Q filed November 7, 2014, including the sections contained therein entitled risk factors and forward-looking statements, for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated February 26, 2015. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. We reiterate that our products are safe. More than 13 billion Monster Energy drinks have been sold and safely consumed around the world over the past 13 years. In August 2014, Monster Beverage and The Coca-Cola Company entered into definitive agreements for a long-term strategic partnership that we believe will accelerate growth for Monster in the global Energy Drink category. Under the agreements, The Coca-Cola Company will acquire an approximate 16.7% ownership interest in Monster, following the issuance of shares to The Coca-Cola Company and will transfer ownership with worldwide energy business to Monster, which in turn will transfer its nonenergy business to The Coca-Cola Company. Monster and The Coca-Cola Company will amend their current distribution coordination agreements to expand distribution with Coca-Cola Bottlers into additional territories. The Coca-Cola Company will become Monster's preferred distribution partner globally, and Monster will become The Coca-Cola Company's exclusive energy play. We believe that this partnership will strategically align both companies for the long term by combining the strengths of The Coca-Cola Company's worldwide bottling system with Monster's dedicated focus and expertise as a leading energy player globally. We believe that this distribution arrangement will accelerate Monster's opportunity to grow internationally. We are actively engaged in preparations for the implementation of the contemplated arrangements. The waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 with respect to the transactions expired on October 15 2014, and in addition, all necessary approvals and consents from foreign antitrust authorities have been obtained. In accordance with this existing agreements with applicable third-party distributors, on February 9, 2015, the company sent notices of termination to certain affected third-party distributors in the U.S. providing for the termination of their respective distribution agreements to be effective at various dates beginning in March 2015. The associated distribution rights are expected to be transitioned to Coca-Cola's distribution network in each applicable territory as of the effective date of the termination of the applicable third-party's rights in such territory. We've also commenced negotiations with certain international Coca-Cola Bottlers with a view to transitioning distribution rights from Monster to such bottlers. The closing of the transactions is still subject to customary closing conditions, but is expected to close in the second quarter of 2015. We're excited by the addition of The Coca-Cola Company energy brands to our Monster portfolio, which will provide us with complementary product offerings in many countries, access to new geographies as well as access to new channels, including vending and specialty accounts. As previously communicated, we plan to review all options available after the transaction closes, and we receive the funds due to the company in terms of the agreements to return a substantial amount of cash to our shareholders. Turning to the fourth quarter results. Throughout the fourth quarter and continuing into the 2015, the beverage industry, in general, has continued to show weakness. However, sales in the Energy Drink category appear to have accelerated, particularly in the U.S. towards the end of 2014 and into 2015. In the fourth quarter, the company achieved record gross sales of $696.3 million, up 12.1% from $621.1 million. Net sales were $605.6 million, up 12% from $540.8 million. Our Original Monster Green energy drink continued to perform well and grew well in excess of the growth of the category in the United States as a whole during the fourth quarter. Sales of Zero Ultra also continued to show good growth in the United States during the fourth quarter. Zero Ultra has become our second best selling item. At the end of the third quarter, we launched Ultra Sunrise, which was well received by retailers as well as consumers, and quickly became one of our top-performing SKUs. Sales of Java Monster also grew in the quarter. During 2014, we redesigned the graphics for our juice-based M-80 and Chaos energy drinks. Those products have been repositioned as our Juice Monster line. M-80 was renamed RIPPER, and the juice content was lowered, which has improved their drinkability. Sales of these products have showed healthy increases since this exercise was completed. Sales of our repositioned Punch Monster line have also increased. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was up 3.6 percentage points to 54.8% from 51.2% in the fourth quarter of last year. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to price increases on our 24-ounce Monster Energy brand energy drinks and our Peace Tea line, changes in product sales mix, lower cost of certain sweetness and other raw material as well as an increase in production efficiencies. Operating income was up 43.2% to $192.9 million from $134.8 million in the 2013 comparable quarter. During the fourth quarter, our operating income was positively affected by the operating income contributed by international operations, particularly Europe and Japan, as compared to an operating loss from these operations in the fourth quarter of 2013. In fact, our operations outside of North America delivered operating income of $13.8 million in the 2014 fourth quarter as compared to an operating loss of $4.4 million in the same quarter in 2013. Consolidated selling expenses in dollars were lower in the quarter than last year. While sponsorship expenses were marginally higher than last year in dollars, in the quarter, they were lower as a percentage of net sales. Results for the 2014 fourth quarter continued to be impacted by expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sales of the company's Monster Energy brand energy drinks. Such expenses were $2.9 million in the 2014 fourth quarter compared with $4.7 million in the -- for the 2013 fourth quarter. Foreign currency losses during the fourth quarter decreased, primarily due to our foreign currency transactions in Japan and South Africa. Our effective tax rate decreased from 42.2% to 34.7%, in the fourth quarter, primarily due to profits earned in certain foreign subsidiaries that have no related tax expense as a result of the prior establishment of valuation allowances on their respective deferred tax assets. Net income was $125.3 million, up 64.7% over net income of $76.1 million earned during the fourth quarter of last year. Diluted earnings per share increased 63.2% to $0.72 from $0.44 in the 2013 comparable quarter. Turning to the full year results. The company achieved record growth sales of $2.8 billion for the 2014 full year, up 9.3% from $2.6 billion in 2013. Net sales were $2.5 billion, up 9.7% from $2.2 billion. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 54.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 52.2% for the year ended 2013. Operating income was up 30.5% to $747.5 million from $572.9 million in 2013. Our operations outside of North America delivered operating income of $37.8 million for the 2014 full year as compared to an operating loss of $13.4 million in the same period the previous year. In the full year, expenses related to regulatory and litigation concerning our Monster Energy drinks were $20.6 million as compared to $17.9 million in 2013. Our effective tax rate decreased from 39.9% in 2013 to 35.2% for the full 2014 year. Net income was $483.2 million, up 42.7% of a net income of $338.7 million in 2013, and diluted earnings per share increased 41.9% to $2.77 from $1.95 in 2013. According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through January 24, 2015, all outlets combined, namely, convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the Energy Drink category, including Shots, increased by 7.1% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 10.8% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 7.6%; sales of Rockstar decreased by 4.2%; 5-Hour decreased by 3.8%; and AMP decreased by 10%. Sales of NOS increased by 38.8% and Full Throttle increased by 7.1%. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended January 24, 2015, sales in the Energy Drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased by 8.5% over the comparable period in 2014. Sales of Monster increased by 11.3% over the comparable period last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 8.7% and NOS was up 42.4%. Rockstar was down 3.8%, 5-Hour was down 1.4%, and AMP was down 7.4%. According to the Nielsen reports for the 4 weeks ended January 24, 2015, Monster's market share of the Energy Drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased by 0.9 of 1 point over the comparable period last -- a year ago to 34.8% against Red Bull's share, which was level with Monster's at 34.8%. Rockstar's share was lower at 7.6%, 5-Hour's share was lower than 8.8%, while NOS' share was higher at 4.3%. According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended January 24, 2015, sales of Energy + Coffee Drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 14.8% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 10.6% higher than in the comparable period last year, while Starbucks Doubleshot energy was 22.2% higher. According to Nielsen, in the convenience gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended February 7, 2015, the Energy Drink category increased 3%. Monster sales were flat versus a year ago. Our market share decreased 1.4 points to 28.2% over the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales increased 1% and its market share decreased by 0.3 of 1 point to 36.2%. Rockstar's sales increased 24% and its market share increased 2.8 points to 18%. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the Energy Drink category grew 9.7% in the month of December 2014. Monster sales increased 1.7% and market share decreased 2.6 points to 32.6% against the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales decreased 8.7% and its market share decreased by 4.8% to 23 -- 9 points to 23.7%. Drivet100 market share increased 10 points to 17.8%, while Boost's market share decreased by 0.1 of 1 point to 16.4%. Coke's market share represented by Burn and Gladiator together decreased 3.4 points to 6.1%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covers single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ended January 2015, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 10.5% to 12.8% in Great Britain, and from 17.4% to 18.3% in France. In the 13-week period ended December 2014, Monster's market share in value as compared to the same period last year increased from 8% to 10.9% in Germany; from 7.4% to 7.9% in Belgium; from 5.2% to 5.9% in The Netherlands; and from 8.1% to 8.7% in Sweden. Monster's market sharing value for the 13 weeks ended January 2015 as compared to the same period last year decreased from 19.4% to 18% in South Africa, and from 21.7% to 21.2% in Spain. According to IRI, Monster's market share increased for the 13 weeks through December 28, 2014 from 24.5% to 29.2% increase. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen for the month of January 2015, in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 14.4% as compared to 9.4% last year, and in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of January grew from 4.6% to 5.2% as compared to the same period last year. According to INTAGE which provides tracking and market statistics in Japan, for the month of January 2015, in the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 29% to 32.6%. Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 12.6% to $584.8 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2014 from $519.4 million in the same period in 2013. Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 10.3% to $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $2.1 billion in the same period in 2013. Contribution margin for the DSD segment increased 31.2% from $177.9 million to $232.5 million in the quarter and from $726.8 million to $908 million for the year. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment decreased 3.2% to $20.8 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2014 from $21.4 million for the same period in 2013 and decreased from $99.1 million for the 2013 year to $95.7 million for the full 2014 year. For the full year, contribution margin increased from a loss of $1 million in the prior year's fourth quarter to a profit of $0.8 million and from a loss of $1.7 million in 2013 to a profit of $3 million in 2014. For the 3-month ended December 31, gross sales to retail grocery specialty chains and wholesalers represent a 3% of gross sales, down from 4% in the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 8% of sales, the same as in the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 64% of sales, the same as in the comparable period in '13. Gross sales internationally represented 23% of sales, up from 22% in the same period a year ago. Other sales are 2% for the period was the same as in the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the fourth quarter of 2014 amounted to $160.1 million compared to $137.9 million in the same quarter in 2013. Included in sub-sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transhipped to the military and their customers overseas. Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the fourth quarter of 2014 in dollars were 17.5% higher than in the same period last year. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increase market share in Europe. In particular, in Great Britain, Germany, The Netherlands and Greece, Monster achieved sales gains and continue to increase its market share. Overall, our Western European and Africa divisions are now operating well, and we have made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and in-store execution. We are continuing to see the benefits of the strategic changes implemented at the end of 2013 and into 2014. Our EMEA division traded profitably during both the third and fourth quarters of 2014, which contributed to the reduction in effective tax rate of the company. Net sales in Asia-Pacific grew 11.1% versus the comparable quarter last year, while net sales in South America decreased 17.1% over the comparable 2013 fourth quarter, mainly due to foreign exchange differences and competitive price adjustment in Chile to offset an indirect tax and issues with our Columbian distributor. Japan contributed a meaningful operating profit as sales there continued to increase. We are continuing with our expansion strategy in international markets, although we decided to defer proposed launches in certain countries for the future following the strategic partnership that was entered into with The Coca-Cola Company during the third quarter. We are continuing with our strategy to secure local production in certain of our international markets in order to improve gross margins, reduce rates, reduce damages and assist in mitigating the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. We are planning to produce Monster in India shortly. Distribution expenses on a consolidated basis as a percentage of net sales in the fourth quarter were 4.1% versus 4.5% in the comparable quarter in 2013. Other selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 9.3% in the quarter versus 10.8% in the comparable period in 2013. While sponsorships and endorsement costs were marginally higher in dollars, they were lower as a percentage of net sales. TDM MAT program costs were lower during the quarter, both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales. General and administrative expenses decreased 3.3%, although payroll costs were slightly higher, including general and administrative costs in the quarter was $1.2 million related to The Coca-Cola transaction. We are continuing to work towards reducing our overall operating costs in our international markets. During the 2014 fourth quarter, no share repurchases were made under the board-authorized share repurchase program. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $370.3 million compared to $211.3 million at December 31, 2013. Short-term investments were $781.1 million compared to $402.2 million at December 31, 2013. Long-term investments increased from $9.8 million to $42.9 million at December 31, 2014. Included in short-term investments are auction rate securities of $3.9 million. Days outstanding for account receivables were 36.4 days at December 31, 2014, and 40.1 days at December 31, 2013 as compared to 40.5 days at September 30, 2014. Inventories decreased to $174.6 million from $221.4 million at December 31, 2013. Average days of inventory was 57.4 days at December 31, 2014, which was lower than the 75.6 days of inventory at December 31, 2013 and lower than the 62.9 days at September 30, 2014. As discussed on the last call, we are currently in the process of launching Monster Energy Ultra Citron and Monster Rehab Peach Tea + Energy. Due to the strong response we received to our 2014 summer promotion of the Monster Energy Valentino Rossi drink in Europe and South Africa, we have converted that item into a permanent SKU in existing countries, in which it is being sold and are planning to launch it in additional European countries in 2015. Gross sales in January 2015, were 11.2% higher than in January 2014. We caution again that sales in the single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points North American international gross margins are healthy. Our 2014 fourth quarter gross margins in North America as well as internationally, generally were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2013. U.S. Nielsen market statistics show the Energy category continues to grow and that Monster Energy's growth is still outpacing the growth of the category as a whole. The new additions to the Monster family that were introduced during 2014 are gaining market share and contributing positively to the overall increase in the company's sales. Our repositioned Punch Monster and Juice Monster lines were positively received by distributors and consumers during 2014 and both distribution and sales of those lines are improving. We believe that Monster Unleaded and Ultra Sunrise lines will continue to increase their contribution to sales throughout 2015. Turning to international markets. We are pleased with the performance of our international expansion, particularly in Japan, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, The Netherlands and Chile. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and year. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Just trying to understand some of the drivers on the top line and sustainability, I think you alluded to at the Analyst Day that lower gas prices were having a benefit, but didn't know if there was seeing that accelerate as we move through the quarter and into this quarter, are if there's anything else? And then also on the Coke partnership now that you've sent out the termination letters, can you kind of give us an idea around the world, are you largely going with a Coke by network, are there some exceptions. Is it 80-20? Just trying to get an idea about that?
Rodney C. Sacks: Just to deal with the gas prices. I don't think there's been a change since we really discussed it last time. And in fact, you're seeing a little bit of an increase in gas prices. For us -- to say anything more, just be speculative. With regard to the transition, I think it's premature for us at this stage to go -- I think that all would be to ready to say that we have sent out notices to probably the majority, of the AB distributors in the U.S., it's not to all the distributors. We are still negotiating with a number of international distributors and I just think at this point, it would be sensitive and premature to go into more detail on that. But obviously, the idea as we've indicated, in general, when there will be exceptions, will be to move to the Coke system.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan.
Brian Doyle - CLSA Limited, Research Division: Quick question. If you can give us an idea, I guess, 2 questions. If you can give us an idea in terms of the impact of FX on the international numbers in the fourth quarter, and then it seems as though FX is probably fully baked in the January numbers. So it would seem as though that the underlying growth actually probably accelerated a little bit if you exclude FX, so can you give us a little bit of an idea in terms of how the FX is impacting the top line numbers? And then can you talk a little bit about the change in the international profitability levels, how much of that is coming from, let's say more local production versus how much is coming from the more efficient spending that you guys have talked about over the last 12 months internationally?
Rodney C. Sacks: I think that the earnings change, impact has probably been -- overall probably being about a percent or a little less. We think that again, it's probably going to be of that order going in the first quarter. But again, we're not sure. I just -- I think that at this point, we should speculate on the first quarter going forward, more on that. So your second question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Amit Sharma with BMO Capital.
Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Quick question on operating leverage. We saw a pretty solid operating leverage, favorable leverage here. Can you talk about what's driving that and as you absorb some of Coca-Cola's Energy brand, should we expect that to accelerate even more from this level?
Rodney C. Sacks: I didn't hear the last part, did we expect?
Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets Canada: As you absorb Coca-Cola's Energy brands, are you expect it to be even higher from our operating leverage perspective? And then a tax rate question as well. As you grow profitability in the international market, should we continue to expect tax rate to come down?
Hilton H. Schlosberg: So the acquisition of the Coca-Cola brand will be a concentrated model. So it'll be very different to the finished goods model that the company operates at this time. And the Coca-Cola brand that coming into the company will be shown as a separate segment in our financials. So when you talk about operating leverage, the basis of the structure of the income statement will be very different between the 2 entities, because in one case, we sell the finished goods. And in the other case, Coke sells a concentrate, which we'll continue selling the concentrate.
Operator: Our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I think John's question was really more my question, which is really related to the international profitability ramp up that you've seen in the last few quarters. Is there way you can give us a little bit color on how much of that is coming from the local production versus some of the selling expense leverage that you're seeing from the investments that you've made and the scale that you're getting in those markets? And then my second question is specific to Asia. I think your sales were up 11.4%. You talked about positive performance in Japan. It is a slowdown from the last quarter, where I think you had 70% plus growth. So a little bit more color just in terms of specifically to Asia was FX a big impact. What are you seeing in terms of the underlying performance in Japan and any other major markets in Asia that you're seeing some traction?
Rodney C. Sacks: I think that the improved profitability is coming from both, and I don't think -- we don't have the breakup available to provide to you at this point, Judy. With regard to Asia, the results in Japan continued to do well. We did have some slowdown in some of the other countries. In the last quarter, Australia was lower, and that offset the increase somewhat. Just to add a little bit of color, Judy, on your first question. Remember that in Europe, improvement in operating performance there is -- there has been no change because we have been producing locally for some time. So it's only in Japan that we have recommenced production that has obviously impacted positively the numbers in Japan.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.
Kevin M. Grundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: So 2 quick ones for me. The acceleration in the category that we're seeing in the U.S., can you kind of point to what you think, other than lower oil prices, might be driving some of the balance that we see in the category? And then second unrelated question. Cash investments is building on the balance sheet. You guys haven't bought back stock recently, but I guess, that's sort of the expectation once the Coke deal closes. Can you talk about your decision not to buyback stock and what we should expect?
Rodney C. Sacks: I think that the acceleration is really -- there is a slightly improved feeling generally in the U.S. and petrol prices are down, the gas prices are down. But other than that, we've just seen that, that bounce back and as we've indicated, it doesn't seem to be followed through in all categories of beverages.
Hilton H. Schlosberg: On the second point, Kevin. We with the inflow of funds from the Coca-Cola transaction, the board is examining or will be examining various ways to return that cash to stockholders. And we've been pretty consistent about that for some time since the deal was announced.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel.
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: I wanted to ask about the disruption in the business from a transition of distribution standpoint. So you sent out the letters earlier this month, so it's been a few weeks since then. So I'm curious what you're -- or what the reaction has been in terms of in-stock out-of-stock that sort of thing? And then broadly before that, obviously, a lot of the distributors knew it was coming. And so could you talk about whether there was any impact in the December, quarter month of January, has it accelerated, as speculation has mounted in sort of not just what the impact has been, but how do you maintain the focus here as you go into end of March on a transition?
Rodney C. Sacks: We took steps at the offset to communicate with the AB Distributors, and gave them certain assurances regarding inventory purchases that we would repurchase, they wouldn't get stuck with inventory. Also, you will appreciate that their are severance fee is dependent on their sales in the 12 months, immediately preceding the termination. So it is in their interest, obviously, to continue increasing their sales out in order to maximizing their own severance payments, and we felt that by giving them the assurance that we would pick up all or buyback all several inventories that there was no reason for them to start trying to rationalize their inventory or try and cut down and only focus on the main SKUs and not carry the supporting brands. And we've had -- we think we had a good effect. This correspondence had a good effect. And we've really not experienced any noticeable disruption from the AB Distributors as compared to our other distributors. I think that continued to perform nicely, you can see that from the results and we are not seeing any despair or differences between the AB Distributors on the one side and Coke distributors or some of the independence on the other side. The trend that we had from these distributors before the notice has continued into the fourth quarter and continued even in the first couple of 2 months of this year. So we aren't seeing that, we are being able to manage that reasonably comfortably. Going forward, obviously, we will see how that goes. We're hoping that by giving the AB Distributors quite a lot of notice, being able to manage these inventory issues and pick up issues, will enable us to also make sure inventory is in place at the Coke plants and at the Coke branches so that when the change over occurs, they will be ready to go with the inventory as well. So we obviously are trying to minimize the disruption that will occur at that point in time. And it will occur slightly, at a slightly different dates, it's not -- the lot of principal dates are probably closer to the early April, there are dates that take place at different times.
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Hilton, can I just ask one follow-up? You said that the board is going to make a determination, about what to do with the cash at some point in time. Is that going to be before or after you have 2 Coke appointees on the board?
Hilton H. Schlosberg: Well, the board can't make a decision, I would believe, until the cash comes into the company. So we have to wait for the close to make a final decision, a final determination. And I imagine that the 2 Coke appointees will be part of that decision. The board's been considering it and continues to do so.
Operator: Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA.
Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division: A couple of questions. The fourth quarter profits in the United States were bigger than the third quarter for the first time I've ever seen. And I'm just wondering if there was any sort of overshipment of anticipation of any other change over that happened at that point? Or, in fact, you had the acceleration in growth rate in the fourth quarter and if you look at 11% in January, that's actually a slight deceleration. So was there anything going on in the fourth quarter that inflated U.S. profits?
Hilton H. Schlosberg: Just lower expenses. There were no, there were absolutely -- there's no issue with product in any quarter not been related to that quarter.
Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division: And would the -- is the lower profit, there wasn't anything onetime -- I'm sorry, the lower expense, there's nothing onetime about that, that we're going to have to lack next year?
Rodney C. Sacks: I'm just looking right now.
Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division: And then while you're looking, if I might just ask, when you -- when Coke's deal is finished, and you look at territories where you already have full distribution, like CCE or the U.S. where you are fully distributed, but now you'll be a Coke brand and a Coke system, do you anticipate an acceleration of growth just as a result of the whole system being firmly behind you? Are there opportunities for an acceleration and growth from that?
Hilton H. Schlosberg: We've been consistent, we've actually said there would be.
Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division: Can you tell us how?
Rodney C. Sacks: Well, we think that there is an alignment, there's an alignment with them on their own brands in each country now as we go forward. There is a -- a longer term, I think commitment where we will be -- our brands, and we as a company, I think will be viewed as part of the group and as part of the longer term, the brands are also will be viewed as more. As part of the longer-term plans. I think outside of the system, I think even the bottlers and distributors have a much shorter horizon for -- vision for the brands. And so I think, they restrict some of their capital investments and efforts, because they just have a different attitude to the brand. We think that we will have a for -- mal focus on cooler programs and vending on those are the things and some of the specialty accounts where they go into key accounts, we will be part of that now those were things that we really didn't ever really participate in before.
Hilton H. Schlosberg: And I think one of the big things as well, if I may just add one comment to what Rodney said, which is correct, was the fact that we now control their inventory brand. I think will enable us to prevent a certain degree of duplication, a certain degree of possible retaliation from one brand to the other. So we'll be able to manage those brands as a system. And then, Karen, I looked at your -- we quickly did a review, Tom and I, and I can't see anything that particularly hits as a one-off issue in the quarter. There seemed to be numbers that really pretty consistent there. Obviously, the only thing that comes up from time-to-time but there's nothing material that I could even put my finger on.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the call back to Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks.
Rodney C. Sacks: On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continue to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. We are particularly excited by the new opportunities that we have going forward with a robust portfolio of energy drink products comprised of our Monster Energy drink line, together with The Coca-Cola Company's Energy brands, and in particular, NOS, which grew its sales and market share in the United States in 2014. We believe that our agreement with The Coca-Cola Company will enable us to focus on our core energy business, while leveraging the strength of The Coca-Cola Company's powerful distribution and bottling system on a worldwide scale. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Corporation Third Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Chairman and CEO, Mr. Rodney Sacks. Mr. Sacks, you may begin your conference.
Rodney C. Sacks: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is here with me; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I'd like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company, that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed March 3, 2014, as well as our most recent report on Form 10-Q filed August 8, 2014, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements, for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated November 6, 2014. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. In August 2014, Monster Beverage and The Coca-Cola Company entered into definitive agreements for a long-term strategic partnership that we believe will accelerate growth for Monster in the fast growing global energy drink category. Under the agreements, The Coca-Cola Company will acquire an approximate 16.7% ownership interest in Monster, following the issuance of shares to The Coca-Cola Company and will transfer ownership of its worldwide energy business to Monster, which in turn will transfer its nonenergy business to the Coca-Cola Company. Monster and The Coca-Cola Company will amend their current distribution agreements in the U.S. and Canada to expand distribution into additional territories. Additionally, the Coca-Cola Company will become Monster's preferred distribution partner globally and Monster will become The Coca-Cola Company's exclusive energy play. We believe that this partnership will strategically align both companies for the long term by combining the strength of The Coca-Cola Company's worldwide bottling system with Monster's dedicated focus and expertise as a leading energy player globally. We believe that this distribution arrangement will accelerate Monster's opportunity to grow internationally. The transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions, is expected to close in early 2015. We're excited by the addition of The Coca-Cola Company energy brands to our Monster portfolio, which will provide us with complementary product offerings in many geographies as well as access to new channels, including vending and specialty accounts. As previously communicated, we plan to review all options available after the transaction closes, and we received the funds due to the company in terms of the agreements to return a substantial amount of cash to our shareholders. Turning to the business. During the third quarter, trends in the beverage industry continued to show weakness, although sales in the energy drink category continued to grow in the mid-single digits. In the third quarter, the company achieved record gross sales of $738.1 million, up 7.5% from the $686.6 million. Net sales were $636 million, up 7.7% from $590.4 million. Our original Monster Green energy drink continued to perform well and grew in excess of the growth of the category in the United States as a whole. Sales of our Ultra line continued to show good growth in the United States during the third quarter. During the quarter, we launched Monster Energy Ultra Black as a summer promotion with 7-Eleven. This promotion was successful, and we are evaluating whether to launch Ultra Black as a permanent item in 2015. We launched Monster Energy Unleaded, which is a carbonated version of our Green energy drink but contains no caffeine, at the end of the quarter. We also launched Monster Energy Ultra Sunrise, a carbonated energy drink, which contains 0 calories and 0 sugar and which is our fourth permanent item in our Ultra line at the end of the quarter. Finally, during the quarter, we launched M3 Monster Super Concentrate in glass bottles as well as a coffee Monster Energy drink in Japan. During the quarter, we also repositioned Übermonster, which was previously sold in 500 ml glass bottles, into 18.6 ounce resealable cans and lined price Übermonster with Monster Energy import. In addition, our repositioned Punch Monster and Juice Monster lines are both achieving increased distribution and sales. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was up 1.7 percentage points to 53.8% from 52.1% in the third quarter of last year. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to lower cost of certain sweeteners and certain other raw materials, price increases in our 24-ounce Monster Energy brand energy drinks and our Peace Tea line as well as changes in product sales mix. Gross profit percentages achieved in the third quarter both in North America as well as internationally were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2013. Operating income was up 25.4% to $189.9 million from $151.4 million in the 2013 comparable quarter. During the third quarter, our operating income was positively affected by the operating income contributed by international operations, particularly Europe and Japan. Operating income was also higher in Mexico. In fact, our operations outside of North America delivered operating income of $9.4 million as compared to an operating loss of $5.2 million in the same quarter last year. Consolidated selling expenses in dollars were lower than last year although general and administrative expenses were higher due to increased payroll expenses. While sponsorship expenses were marginally higher than last year, in dollars, they were lower as a percentage of net sales. Cost of our TDM MET program were lower, largely driven by reductions in those programs in Europe. Additionally, premiums in point-of-sale costs were lower. Results for the 2014 third quarter continued to be impacted by expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion ingredients, usage, safety and sales of the company's Monster Energy brand energy drinks. Such expenses were $4.9 million in the 2014 third quarter compared with $6 million for the 2013 third quarter. Foreign currency losses during the quarter increased primarily due to our foreign currency transactions in Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan, Mexico and South Africa. The effective tax rate decreased from 38.8% to 35.6%, primarily due to profits earned in certain foreign subsidiaries that had no related tax expense as a result of the prior establishment of valuation allowances on their respective deferred tax assets. Net income was $121.6 million, up 31.9% over net income of $92.2 million earned during the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share increased 31.7% to $0.70 from $0.53 in the 2013 comparable quarter. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through October 25, 2014, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including shots, increased by 4.8% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 8% in the 13-week period while sales of Red Bull increased by 6.2%. Sales of Rockstar decreased by 8.6%. 5-Hour decreased by 6.1%, and AMP decreased by 9.6%. Sales of NOS increased by 33.9%, and Full Throttle increased by 5%. According to Nielsen reports, for the 4 weeks ended October 25, 2014, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel in dollars increased by 4.8% over the comparable period in 2013. Sales of Monster increased by 7.4% over the comparable period last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 6.8%. And NOS was up 14.7%, Rockstar was down 13.3%, 5-Hour was down 8.1%, and AMP was down 9.5%. According to Nielsen for the 4 weeks ended October 25, 2014, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased by 0.09 points over the comparable period a year ago to 36.3%, against Red Bull's share, which was lower than Monster's market share at 34%; Rockstar's share was lower at 6.7%; 5-Hour's share was lower at 8.7%; while NOS' share was higher at 4.1%. According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended October 25, 2014, sales of Energy + Coffee Drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 11.7% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 6.3% higher than in the comparable period last year, while Starbucks' Doubleshot Energy was 18.7% higher. Java Monster's sales continued to exceed those of Starbucks' Doubleshot Energy. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended October 18, 2014, the energy drink category declined 1%, while Monster sales decreased 11%. Our market share decreased 2.7 points to 26.2% over the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales increased 3%, and its market share increased 1.7 points to 38.9%. Rockstar's sales increased 14%, and its market share increased 2.3 points to 17.5%. Monster's market share was negatively impacted over this period by Red Bull's summer edition launch with 7-Eleven and Monster's failure to have a comparable promotional activity this year with 7-Eleven, due to conflicting priorities from our distribution partner in Canada. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 17.6% in the month of September 2014. Monster sales increased 18.2%. Our market share increased 0.2 points to 33.8% against the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales decreased 14.8%, and its market share decreased by 8.8 points to 23.1%. Boost's sales increased 7.1%, and its market share decreased 1.4 points to 14.1%. Vive 100, new in 2013, has grown to 19.1% market share, while Coke's market share, represented by Burn and Gladiator together, decreased 3.9 points to 6.4%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covers single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen in the 13-week periods ended September and October 2014 -- the actual 13-week periods varied by a few weeks between different markets and countries -- Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 7.8% to 7.9% in Belgium; from 8.3% to 9.8% in Germany; From 10.6% to 11.4% in Great Britain; from 22% to 22.7% in Spain; and from 7.2% to 8% in Sweden. Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ending September/October 2014 as compared to the same periods last year decreased from 21.1% to 19% in South Africa, although volume was up; and in France from 17.5% to 16.7%. According to IRI, Monster's market share in Greece for the 13 weeks to the end of September increased from 22.9% to 27.3%. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in the EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen for the month of September 2014, in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 11.8% as compared to 8.8% last year; and in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of September 2014 grew from 3.5% to 5.7% as compared to the same period last year. Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 7.6% to $609.9 million for the 3 months ended September 30, 2014, from $566.8 million in the same period in 2013. Contribution margin for the DSD segment increased 19.4% from $194.9 million to $232.7 million. Gross sales of our Original Monster Green energy drink continued to increase in the quarter, as did sales of both our Ultra and Java Monster lines. The increase in sales of these products was partially offset by lower sales in certain SKUs, including Monster Energy Absolutely Zero, Lo-Carb Monster Energy and the Monster Rehab line and Import. Gross sales of Peace Tea for the third quarter were higher than in the comparable period in 2013. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment increased 10.1% to $26 million, from $23.7 million for the 3 months ended September 30, 2014, primarily due to increased sales by volume of aseptic juices and Hubert's Lemonades. Contribution margin increased from a loss of $2.2 million in the prior year third quarter to a profit of $0.6 million. For the 3 months ended September 30, 2014, gross sales to retail groceries, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 3% of gross sales, down from 4% in the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 10% of sales, up from 9% in the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 62% of sales, down from 63% in the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales internationally represented 24% of sales, up from 22% in 2013. Other sales of 1% for the period were lower than the 2% in the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the third quarter amounted to $173.2 million compared to $151.6 million in the same quarter in 2013. Included in such sales were sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. Net sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa in the third quarter of 2014 in dollars were at $75 million, 7% higher than the same period last year. Monster continues to gain momentum and increased its market-shared retail in EMEA and in particular, in Greece, Spain, Great Britain, Italy, Germany and Sweden. We're continuing to see the benefits of the strategic changes implemented last year. Our EMEA division traded profitably during the third quarter of 2014, which contributed to the reduction in the effective tax rate of the company. Net sales in Asia-Pacific grew 79.4% versus the comparable quarter last year, while net sales in South America grew 65.6% over the comparable 2013 third quarter. In Mexico, growth sales were marginally higher for the quarter. Japan contributed a meaningful operating profit as sales there continued to increase. Our distributor in Brazil continues to secure increased distribution in sales. We are continuing with our expansion strategy in international markets. Although we decided to defer proposed launches in certain countries for the future following the strategic partnership that was entered into with The Coca-Cola Company during the quarter. We are continuing with our strategy to secure local production in certain of our international markets in order to improve gross margins, reduce freight, reduce damages and assist in mitigating the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. The Coca-Cola Company partnership should also help in achieving this objective. In the interim, we are continuing with our plan to produce Monster in India as well as in South Africa. Distribution expenses on a consolidated basis as a percentage of net sales in the third quarter were 4.5% versus 4.6% in the comparable quarter in 2013. Other selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.1% higher in the quarter versus 12% in the comparable period in 2013. While sponsorships and endorsement costs were marginally higher in dollars, they were lower as a percentage of net sales. Premiums, point-of-sale costs and the TDM MET program costs were lower during the quarter, both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales. General and administrative expenses were lower, although payroll costs was slightly higher, with the result that overall general and administrative costs increased 1.4% in the third quarter. Included in general and administrative costs were increased professional service costs, of which $2.6 million related to The Coca-Cola transaction. We are continuing to work towards reducing our overall operating costs in our international markets. Our effective tax rate in the 2014 third quarter was 35.6% compared to 38.8% in the 2013 third quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of profits earned in foreign subsidiaries that have no related tax expense as a result of the prior establishment of valuation allowance on their deferred tax assets. During the third quarter, no share repurchases were made under the board-authorized share repurchase program. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $408.3 million compared to $211.3 million at December 31, 2013. Short-term investments, of which auction rate securities comprised $4.8 million were $588 million compared to $402.2 million at December 31, 2013. Long-term investments increased to $28.4 million from $9.8 million at December 31, 2013. Accounts receivable net increased to $330.2 million from $291.6 million at December 31, 2013. Days outstanding for trade accounts receivables were 40.5 days at September 30, 2014, and 44.7 days at September 30, 2013, compared to 40.1 days at December 31, 2013. Inventories decreased to $205.4 million from $221.4 million at December 31, 2013. Average days of inventory was 62.9 days at September 30, 2014, which was lower than the 78.7 days of inventory at September 30, 2013, and lower than the 75.6 days of inventory at December 31, 2013. We are planning to launch Monster Energy Ultra Citron and Monster Rehab, Peach Tea and Energy early in 2015. Due to the strong response received to our summer promotion of the Monster Energy Valentino Rossi drink in Europe and South Africa, we have decided to convert that item into a permanent SKU in the existing countries in which it is being sold and to launch it in additional European countries in 2015. Gross sales in October 2014 were approximately 9.2% higher than in October 2013. The increase in gross sales in the United States were 7.4% and the North America was 9.1%. We caution again that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. On the litigation front, the litigation between the company and the City Attorney of San Francisco is proceeding through the discovery process stage, the court has issued an order setting the case for a 2-week bench trial beginning in February 8, 2016. On August 6, 2014, the Attorney General for the State of New York issued a second subpoena seeking additional documents and the deposition of a company employee. The company has moved to quash the second subpoena. The briefing on the motion is currently ongoing. In the Kona federal securities case, plaintiffs have filed a motion seeking approval of the settlement. The settlement class members have until December 1, 2014, to object to opt out of the settlement and the final approval hearing is scheduled for January, 29, 2015. Again, once finalized, the settlement will result in the action being dismissed with prejudice. The proposed settlement contains no admission of liability or wrongdoing on the part of any of the defendants, each of whom continues to deny all the allegations. The full amount of the settlement will be paid by the company's insurance carriers. The company assumes no obligation to update any statements made with respect to ongoing litigation and regulatory matters, including with respect to the foregoing disclosures, whether as to new information, future events or otherwise other than as required by law. Given the current litigation and pending regulatory requests, we will refrain from answering questions or commenting further on these specific subjects. We are happy, of course, to answer questions that you may have about our products in general or about the third quarter as best as we can after we've concluded our discussion on the business. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. North American and international gross margins are healthy. Our 2014 third quarter gross margins in North America as well as internationally, generally, were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2013. U.S. Nielsen market statistics show the energy category continues to grow, that Monster Energy's growth is still outpacing the growth of the category as a whole. The new additions to the Monster family that were introduced during 2013 and this year are continuing to gain market share and contributing positively to the overall increase in the company's sales. Our recently repositioned Punch Monster and Juice Monster lines were positively received by distributors and consumers, and both distribution and sales of those lines continue to increase. We believe that Monster Unleaded and Ultra Sunrise lines that were introduced at the end of the quarter will commence contributing to sales in the fourth quarter and through 2015. Unleaded with no caffeine is designed to attract new consumers, as well as to increase usage occasions by existing Monster Green energy drink consumers. Turning to international markets. We are pleased with the performance of our international expansion, particularly in Japan, Spain, Germany, Great Britain, Sweden, Greece and Brazil. I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bill Chappell of SunTrust.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Just on the international business. Trying to understand 2 things. One, how much of an impact did the Canadian, I guess, 7-Eleven issue have on the total business? And then two, kind of longer term, as we look at the Coke partnership, does that change your near-term plan? Do you pullback? Do we expect some transition issues until it's signed? Just trying to understand if maybe there were countries that you were planning on going into or planning on expanding that you might, kind of, put on hold until everything is done. And how we should look at that over the next couple of quarters.
Rodney C. Sacks: I think the Canadian impact was not substantial but it was there during the quarter. And I think you could see from the numbers that we showed for North America in October, that you saw the improvement coming through from Canada. And that's just timing and promotional issues. And we will do a promotion, I think, with 7-Eleven but it didn't fall into the quarter with Ultra Black. That is still -- that is being planned for Canada. With respect to the transition: The markets were not, at this point, major markets or markets that, I think, would really impact the results in -- certainly in the near term, but we just, obviously, felt it was important for at least -- make the disclosure that we had in fact deferred some of those introductions. Going forward, we just believe that we are going to continue to go forward pretty much as planned. There always is, obviously, a little bit of an effect on this -- on our results through the interim stage, because while we, obviously, are encouraging our distributors to continue giving the brand the same level of attention and investment, and we've tried to assure them that we will, obviously, compensate them appropriately, there is still some distributors who will naturally pull back and because of concerns as to whether they will continue to keep the brand and when there will be a transition. So that uncertainty, clearly, will have some effect. Although we don't believe it will be major, we do believe there will be some effect. But we really can't tell more than that. We are obviously starting to make plans for the transition. But again, until the transaction closes, there is -- we are limited in what we can do. But we are looking to close the transaction early in 2015 as we previously have indicated.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.
Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Just 2 quick ones for me. On Rehab, Rodney, I was wondering if you could provide any perspective on that? And are there any plans there to kind of get that brand reinvigorated? And then the second question is our understanding is trends in the energy drink category are really taking off at Walmart and I was just hoping you can provide some context on kind of what's going on there. Is it just more cold cooler placement up by the register? If you could just give us some context on that?
Rodney C. Sacks: I think that if you look at Rehab, the drop off that we -- or the decrease that we had experienced at the time we introduced -- or pretty much close to the time we introduced the Ultra line, has fallen off and the numbers are looking much better. That's still a major line for us. We have taken steps to just focus consumers on what the product is and to try and communicate better to consumers that it's an iced tea, that it's not carbonated. We are looking at some slight changes to the graphics, probably to align it more with a tea product, as opposed to, sort of, a carbonated energy drink, which has a stronger presence in a black can, traditionally. And we also believe that by some other minor adjustments, which we'll make to the line, we believe that we will have a good prospect of, basically, improving sales going forward. We are also introducing the Peach Tea, which is a nice variant. And so we believe that, that line will continue to grow again, but that's part of what we're doing. There was obviously some impact on that line from the introduction of the Ultra. We are seeing more of a comeback on -- also on our Lo-Carb now in the last quarter, that had dropped off more significantly in previous quarters and the numbers are improving on that product as well. And then finally, with regard to Absolutely Zero, which did have some fall off as well from the -- at that same time as we introduced the Ultra line, we have -- we're also taking steps to redesign the can and do things, and we're actually making some further improvements to the redesigned can. So we are hopeful we'll be able to get those sub lines or -- growing again.
Thomas J. Kelly: Maybe I just could comment on Walmart. What's happened at Walmart is that they expanded the category both on the warm and on the cold shelf. We've invested in cooler placement with the organization, and I really would encourage you to visit a few stores and see the expanded sets and the positioning that we have now in the Walmart stores. It's actually very, very interesting, and we're excited with it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Amit Sharma of BMO Capital Markets.
Rodney C. Sacks: Hello?
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers of UBS.
Rodney C. Sacks: We're not -- we're hearing silence.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Faucher of JP Morgan.
Rodney C. Sacks: Seems to be something wrong with the line. We are not getting any of the participants. We can't hear anything. [Technical Difficulty]
John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So just 2 quick questions here, I hope. One, can you talk a little bit about foreign exchange and the impact on the international business as we look at it? Obviously, there's been a lot of volatility. So can you talk a little bit about -- less so on the top line but more so on the margins, how you feel like you're situated to deal with some of this volatility in terms of transactional FX, et cetera? And then a separate question, which is as you talk about returning some of this cash to shareholders, can you talk about what your criteria are going to be and how we should think about that as we head into 2015?
Rodney C. Sacks: Hilton will discuss the foreign exchange, John.
Hilton H. Schlosberg: John, we hedged our balance sheet transactions in various currencies and the results -- the overall results in the fourth -- in the third quarter was not a material amount, and you'll see that in the Q that will be released, hopefully, tomorrow. Turning on -- turning to the cash that we are -- that we're discussing and we'll be discussing more with the board tomorrow, there are a number of programs that we are looking at and a number of opportunities to return cash to shareholders that is kind of premature at this stage as the board will be in discussions on this point tomorrow.
John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. If I can just follow up on the FX piece in terms of -- less so on the balance sheet transactions but more so, let's say, on dollar-based raw materials in foreign countries and finished goods and things like that. Is that something where you think that can have a meaningful impact on some of the international profitability, again, given some of the swings you're having in these currencies?
Thomas J. Kelly: It hasn't to date, and we don't anticipate that it will to any significant degree. You're talking, in the quarter, of a foreign exchange loss in basically of the order of $1 million that was expensed against the income statement.
Operator: Our next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: [indiscernible] additional growth in the third quarter; 14%, pretty solid. It looks like EMEA was a little bit softer but you had very good growth from Japan, Asia Pacific and Brazil. So can you just talk about maybe some of the underlying market trends that you're seeing in some of your key European markets. And then how much benefit you're seeing in markets like Japan's, where you've had some of the innovations rollout and whether there was any timing benefit in that number. And then I guess on a longer-term basis, I know we've talked about the Coke partnership enabling you to become more profitable in international markets. But just wanted to see if you can give us any, kind of, road map as to how quickly you can envision the profitability ramping up in those markets once the deal closes?
Rodney C. Sacks: The international markets are quite a mixed bag. While the growth, obviously, was slower in EMEA, overall, there were some markets that were nice and then some markets faced some competition in some cases from some lower-priced entrees, for example, in South Africa. And the same thing even in South America. These results, again, were led by a number of countries, but there were countries within the region that were also softer and some of that is just to do with timing. In the case of France, if you look at the numbers, there was -- if you remember, at the end of last year, there was a buy-in before -- in advance of the introduction of a tax in France. And then during the quarter, there was a lower stockholding this quarter than had been compared to last year, where there was, sort of, an increased larger stockholding. So that affected the French results. So these are things that are making or resulting in our results being quite choppy. We're hoping that as we are able to go forward and as the brands get bigger and more established in these countries, that sort of influence from stockholding -- changes in stockholdings will continue to diminish. Again, some of the stockholding buy-ins and longer delivery times for some of the South American and Asian markets also affected the results, because we were -- if you also look at the stockholding levels and if you look at sales out, they remain healthy in a number of countries. We're positive, but if you look at the sales in at any one quarter, you may find that the results are actually negative. And so you've got to look at the actual underlying business. And while the trends remained solid, we are having this choppiness in some of the results from various countries. So we think that will start getting smoothed out better as we continue to become more -- both effective -- becoming more established in these different countries and also in many countries going into the Coke system. We don't really have a program yet. We're still at the very preliminary stages of actually understanding the Coke system. We need to be able to have discussions and meetings with various Coke bottlers. We need to achieve a consensus and agreement on margin -- the value chains and margins, and making decisions exactly when we're going to switch to which and in which countries. And that, at the moment, is a complicated matrix and we really can't, I think, speculate to that going forward. I don't know if you'd like to add anything on that, Hilton.
Hilton H. Schlosberg: I just would like to -- yes, I'd like add to Judy about a comment on Europe, which was spot on, in fact. There was a destocking, we believe, that took place in July in Europe -- with our distribution partners in Europe. And that was quite -- that was quite noticeable.
Rodney C. Sacks: I think that's all. You can see the numbers, obviously, you gain from the October numbers. Again, it's a single month but yet we have seen a pickup in October in Europe, particularly.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vivien Azer from Cowen and Company.
Vivien Nicole Azer - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: My question has to do with your average net sales per case and the 2.5% growth that you saw in the third quarter. You mentioned price increases on the 24-ounce packaging. So I'm curious whether you could give us a sense for the balance between pricing and mix, in terms of that 2.5% growth in average net sales per case?
Hilton H. Schlosberg: It's in the Q. The Q will be released, as I said, hopefully, within next 24 hours, if not, on Monday. So it's all there.
Vivien Nicole Azer - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay, fair enough. Then maybe a bigger picture question that relates to that metric. It's impressive the growth that you're seeing in your average net sales per case but at the same time, you're seeing consistent deceleration in terms of your net sales growth. So can you talk, kind of, high level how you think about the balance between volumes versus pricing and mix? And how important it is for you guys to generate outsized volume growth because the 5% growth that you saw this quarter is the weakest that we've seen in a number of years.
Hilton H. Schlosberg: I think that's actually a situation that is relating to where the market has been and where the market is going. We spoke a little bit about where the October numbers are, and the growth in October. At this time, we're not planning to have any price increases on our major [ph] product lines, but that, in fact, may change as we move forward into next year. So from our perspective on pricing, it's steady as she goes. We'll be absorbing the Coca-Cola transaction early in 2015. That's a concentrate model and that will affect average pricing as well. So I hope that answered your question, but I'm not sure what specific issue you were getting at.
Operator: There are no further questions in queue.
Rodney C. Sacks: On behalf of Monster, I would like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. Continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continue to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. We are particularly excited by the new opportunities that we are going -- we have going forward with a robust portfolio of energy drink products comprised of our Monster Energy drink line together with The Coca-Cola Company's energy brands. We believe that our agreement with The Coca-Cola Company will enable us to focus on our core energy business while leveraging the strength of The Coca-Cola Company's powerful distribution and bottling system on a worldwide scale. We reiterate that our products are safe, are properly labeled and the caffeine content of the Monster is approximately 10 milligrams per ounce, less than 0.5 milligrams per ounce of the caffeine labels contained in Starbucks and other coffee house brewed coffee. In other words, a medium Starbucks 16-ounce sized brewed coffee contains approximately 330 milligrams of caffeine, which is more than double the approximately 160 milligrams of caffeine that is contained in the same sized Monster Energy drink. More than 12 billion Monster Energy drinks have been sold and safely consumed around the world over the past 12 years. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect.

===== 2014 Q2  (2014-08-07 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Member of Executive Committee and Chairman of Hansen Beverage Company
Analysts: Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Kevin M. Grundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division Mark S.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to your Monster Beverage Corporation Second Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn you over to your host for today's conference, Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Mr. Sacks, you may begin.
Rodney C. Sacks: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg our Vice President, is with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I would like to remind the listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company, that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed March 3, 2014, as well as our most recent report on Form 10-Q filed May 9, 2014, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated August 7, 2014. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. We reiterate that our products are safe. More than 12 billion Monster Energy drinks have now been sold and safely consumed around the world over the past 12 years. To put the level of caffeine in Monster Energy drinks in context, we again remind listeners that a medium Starbucks 16-ounce-sized brewed coffee contains approximately 330 milligrams of caffeine, which is more than double the approximately 160 milligrams of caffeine there is contained in the same-sized Monster Energy drink. On April 30, 2014, that American Beverage Association formally adopted new U.S. model guidelines for energy drink companies that are supported by the company, as well as all other major energy drink companies in the USA. The litigation between the company and the City Attorney of San Francisco is proceeding through the discovery process stage. In the Kona federal securities case on July 29, 2014, the court issued an order granting preliminary approval of the proposed stipulation of settlement. When finalized, the settlement will resolve the litigation and result in the action being dismissed with prejudice. The proposed settlement contains no admission of liability or wrongdoing on the part of any of the defendants, each of whom continues to deny all the allegations. The full amount of the settlement will be paid by the company's insurance carriers. The company assumes no obligation to update any statements made with respect to ongoing litigation and regulatory matters, including -- with respect to the foregoing disclosures, whether as to new information, future events or otherwise, other than as required by law. Given the current litigation and pending regulatory requests, we will refrain from answering questions or commenting further on these specific subjects. We are happy, of course, to answer questions that you may have about our products in general or about the second quarter as best we can after we have concluded our discussion on the business. Turning to the business, in the second quarter of 2014, the beverage market in the USA, our largest market, continue to experience softness. DSD volumes declined in all major channels, including the convenience and guest channel. In contrast, the energy drink category continued to grow in the mid-single digits. Together, the RTD coffee drink category and the energy drink category were the 2 best-performing sectors. In the second quarter, the company achieved record gross sales of $779 million, up 7.6%. Net sales were $687.2 million, up 8.9%. Our Original Green energy drink continued to perform well and grew in excess of the growth of the category as a whole. Particularly noteworthy is that sales of our Ultra line continued to improve during the second quarter. We are still in the process of implementing the repositioning of our DUB line into our Punch Monster line, and we are also repositioning our Juice Monster line. New graphics and formulas for these lines are now finding their way onto retail shelves. While we are pleased with the sales achieved in the second quarter, our revenues were affected by less robust growth rates for the Energy category as a whole, both in the U.S.A., as well as in our international markets. While sales in the U.S.A. of our Ultra line were accretive, that did result in some cannibalization generally across our existing SKUs, primarily Absolutely Zero and Lo-Carb. However, during the quarter, Lo-Carb made up a portion of its previous sales losses. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was up 1.9 percentage points to 55.2% from 53.3% in the second quarter of last year. This increase was primarily due to lower allowances compared to the prior year, increased sales of our Ultra line, as well as lower cost of goods, particularly in North America, due to lower sweetener costs. Increased selling prices for our Monster 24-ounce line and increased prices for our Peace Tea line, which is now sold primarily in non-pre-packed priced cans. Operating income was up 20.3% to $215.8 million. During the second quarter, our operating income was positively affected by the operating profit contributed by international operations, particularly the Europe, Middle East and Africa regions. Additionally, our operating results improved in Asia-Pacific and South America, principally due to improved profitability in Japan and Chile, and a reduction in losses in Australia. Operating income in Mexico was also higher. Consolidated selling expenses in dollars were below last year. While sponsorship fees were higher, costs of our TDM met program were lower, driven by the reduction in Europe. Additionally, premiums were lower as our 2013 Gear program was not repeated. Point-of-sale costs were also lower. Foreign currency losses were substantially lower than last year. The effective tax rate decreased from 39.3% to 34.7%, primarily due to profits earned in foreign subsidiaries that had no related tax expense and as a result of the prior establishment of valuation allowances on the deferred tax assets. Net income was $141 million, up 31.9% over net income of $106.9 million earned during the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share increased 31.5% from $0.62 to $0.81 in the second quarter of 2014. According to Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through July 26, 2014, for all outlets combined and the convenience grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the Energy Drink category, including shots, increased by 5.3% versus the same period a year ago. Sales in Monster grew 9% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 4%. Sales of Rockstar decreased by 0.08%. 5-hour's decreased by 2.5% and AMP decreased by 11.1%. Sales of NOS increased by 25.3%, and Full Throttle increased 3%. According to the Nielsen reports, for the 4 weeks ended July 26, 2014, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel in dollars increased by 4.6% over the comparable period in 2013. Sales of Monster increased by 6.6% over the comparable period last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 4.3%; NOS was up 30.5%; Rockstar was down 7.2%; 5-Hour was down 3.6%; and AMP was down 1.8%. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 26, 2014, Monster's market share in the Energy Drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 0.6 points over the comparable period a year ago to 34.6% against Red Bull's share, which was lower at 35.3%. Rockstar share was lower at 6.9%, 5-Hour's was lower at 9%, while NOS share was higher at 3.5% According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended July 26, 2014, sales in Energy + Coffee Drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 9.1% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 4.9% higher than in the comparable period last year, while Starbucks Doubleshot Energy was 16.1% higher. Java Monster sales continue to exceed those of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12-weeks-ended June 28, 2014, the Energy Drink category grew 2%, while Monster sales increased 16%. Our market share increased 3.5% points to 27.9% over the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales increased 4%, and its market share increased 0.of a point 9 to 38.8%. Rockstar's sales decreased 11% and its market share decreased 2.2 points to 14.9%. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the Energy Drink category grew 12.2% in the month of June 2014. Monster sales increased 6.6%. Our market share decreased 2 points to 38.6% against the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales decreased 18%, and its market share decreased by 9 points to 24.4%. Boost's sales increased 15.4%, and its market share increased by 0.4 to 13.7%. Drivet100, new in 2013, has grown to 12.2% market share, while Coke market share represents Burn and Gladiator together decreased 2.9 points to 6.6%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased by 9.8% to $660.1 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2014 from $601 million in the same period in 2013. Operating income for the DSD segment increased 19.1% from $215 million to $256.1 million. Gross sales of our Original Monster Green energy drink continue to increase in the quarter, as did sales of both the Ultra and Java Monster lines. However, the increase in sales of these products was partially offset by lower sales in certain SKUs, including Monster Energy, Absolutely Zero, Lo-Carb Monster Energy and the Monster Rehab line and import. Net sales for our Peace Tea line was higher. Net sales for the company's warehouse segment decreased 9.5% to $27.1 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2014, mainly due to reduced sales of Hubert's Lemonades in glass bottles. Operating income increased 16.9% from $1.9 million to $1.3 million this quarter. Net sales of Peace Tea for the second quarter were higher than in the comparable period in 2013. We continue to believe that the Peace Tea brand has good growth potential. For the 3 months ended June 30, 2014, gross sales to retail grocery specialty chains and wholesalers represents a 4% of growth sales, up from 3% in the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represent 9% of sales, down from 11% in 2013. Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 62% of sales, the same as in the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales internationally represented 23% of sales, up from 22% in 2013. Other sales of 2% for the period were also consistent with the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales to customers outside of the United States in the second quarter of 2014 amounted to $180.2 million compared to $160.4 million in the same quarter in 2013. Included in the sub-sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and cargo-shipped to the military and their customers overseas. Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the second quarter of 2014 in dollars were $80.3 million, 14.6% higher than in the same period last year. Once we continue to gain momentum and increase its market share at retail in EMEA and, in particular, in Greece, Spain, Belgium, Sweden, Germany and South Africa. We're now starting to see the benefits of the strategic changes implemented in the second quarter of last year. Overall, our EMEA division traded profitably during the second quarter of 2014, which contributed to the reduction in the effective tax rate of the company. Central and Eastern Europe contributed in operating profit before allocation of corporate overhead for the first time. Gross sales in the Africa Pacific region grew 29 -- sorry, Asia Pacific region grew 29.9% versus the comparable quarter last year. Gross sales in Mexico were higher for the quarter. During the quarter, Japan contributed an operating profit to the division, and sales there continued to increase satisfactorily. In addition, significant progress was made in Chile. Our distributor in Brazil continues to secure increased distribution in sales for month-to-month. We are continuing with our expansion strategy in international markets. In the quarter, we launched Monster in Angola, Serbia, Macedonia and Bahrain. In addition, we are planning to launch Monster in a number of additional countries later this year, including Bosnia, Georgia, Oman, Qatar and Nigeria. We are continuing with our strategy to secure local production in certain of our international markets in order to improve gross margins, reduce rates, reduce damages and assist in mitigating the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. Production in Japan commenced in February and contributed to the improved results earned last year in the quarter. In addition, we are continuing to make good distribution progress in India. Our plans to produce Monster Energy Drinks in India, as well as in South Africa, are progressing. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales achieved in the second quarter of 2014 was 55.2%. This is 53.3% in the comparable quarter in 2013. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially due to lower allowances, product mix and lower cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales due to higher percentage of our sales that was represented by the Ultra line, as well as lower cost of goods, particularly in North America due to lower sweetener costs, increased selling expense prices of our Monster 24-ounce line and increased prices of Peace Tea, which is now sold primarily in non-pre-priced cans. Gross profit percentages achieved in the second quarter, both in North America, as well as outside North America were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2013. As indicated on our last conference call, we have covered a significant portion of our anticipated requirements for aluminum cans in 2014, as well as a significant portion of our anticipated requirements for apple juice and sugar over the same period. We do not believe that our current levels increases in costs of any raw materials will have a material negative effect on our margins. Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales in the second quarter were 4.4% versus 4.5% in the comparable quarter in 2013. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.5% in the quarter versus 11.6% in the comparable period in 2013. While sponsorships and endorsement costs, as well as commissions and merchandise displays were higher. Costs of premiums, point-of-sale and allocated trade development and TDM met program were lower during the quarter. General and administrative expenses increased 8.9% in the second quarter. The increase in general and administrative costs was primarily attributable to increased professional service costs for legal, accounting and other professional costs, other expenses incurred in connection with the regulatory matters and litigation regarding our Monster Energy drinks. We are continuing to work towards reducing our overall operating costs in our international markets. Our effective tax rate in the 2014 second quarter was 34.7% compared to 39.3% in the 2013 second quarter. The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily the result of profits earned in foreign subsidiaries that have no related to tax expenses as a result of the prior establishment of a valuation allowance on their deferred tax assets. During the 2014 second quarter, no share repurchases were made under the board-authorized share repurchase program. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $373.1 million compared to $211.3 million at December 31, 2013. Short-term investments of $454 million compared to $402.2 million at December 31, 2013. Long-term investments, of which option rates securities comprised $12.8 million increased to $51.7 million from $9.8 million at December 31, 2013. Accounts receivable net increased to $395.5 million from $291.6 million at December 31, 2013. Days outstanding for trade accounts receivables were 45.3 days at June 30, 2014, and 42.8 days at June 30, 2013, compared to 40.1 days at December 31, 2013. Inventories decreased to $207.9 million from $221.4 million at December 31, 2013. The average days of inventory was 60.8 days at June 30, 2014, which was lower than the 71.3 days of inventory at June 30, 2013, and lower than the December 75.6 days of inventory at December 31, 2013. We are planning to launch Monster Unleaded, a new non-caffeinated energy drink in the Monster line in the U.S.A. later this year, as well as Ultra Sunrise, which is an extension to our successful Ultra line. Ultra Sunrise has a citrus-based flavor. Our new Monster Energy Valentino Rossi energy drink that was positioned as a summer promotion in selected countries in Europe and South Africa, has been well-received by both retail buyers and consumers. We are in the process of introducing an Ultra Black variant as a summer promotion with 7-Eleven in the U.S.A. In the ordinary course, we introduced additional existing SKUs in various countries around the world from time to time. However, I would like to specifically mention that we are planning a full launch of Monster M3 in glass bottles in Japan later this month, as well as a Coffee Monster Energy drink in Japan later this year. Gross sales in July 2014 were approximately 7.9% higher than in July 2013. The increase in gross sales in the United States was, in fact, higher than this percentage. The increase in gross sales was partly offset by decreased sales in certain international markets in July as compared to last year mainly due to destocking that occurred in some countries. We caution again that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of our results for the full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. North American and international gross margins are healthy. Our 2014 second quarter gross margins in North America, as well as international, generally were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2013. U.S. Nielsen market statistics show the energy category continues to grow in the mid-single-digits and that Monster Energy's growth is still outpacing the growth of the category is all. The new additions to the Monster family that were introduced during 2013 and earlier this year are continuing to gain market share and contributing positively to the overall increase in the company sales. We believe our recently repositioned Punch Monster and Juice Monster lines will appeal to a broader consumer demographic and will be positively received by our distributors and consumers in 2014. We believe that Monster Unleaded will appeal to consumers since the true caffeine, who until now were not consumers of energy drink, as well as to consumers who would like to limit their daily consumption of caffeine but wish to increase the consumption of Monster, particularly later in the day or early evening. Our new strawberry and peanut butter cup Muscle Monster energy drinks are performing well and should further enhance the Muscle Monster line in 2014. We are now rolling out our peanut butter cup Muscle Monster drink to the general market. Turning to international markets. We are pleased with the performance of our international expansion, particularly in Japan. Spain, South Africa, Greece, Belgium, Germany, Brazil and Chile. According to the Nielsen, in the 4-week period to the end of June 2014, the actual days of the 4-week period vary by a few days between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 21.6% to 22.9% in Spain, from 8.3% to 9.1% in Germany, and from 7% to 7.9% in Sweden. In France, our market share remains flat at approximately 16.8%. In Belgium, our market share increased from 7.1% to 8.2%, and from 9.9% to 10.3% in Great Britain. Monster's retail market share value for the 4 weeks ending May 2014, as compared to the same period last year, grew from 18.3% to 19.9% in South Africa, and according to IRI, from 19.5% to 24.1% in Greece. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. In Chile, in May, Monsters retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 7% to 11%, and in Brazil, in June, from 2.9% to 5.2% as compared to the same period last year. Sales of Monster in Japan are continuing to increase and remain encouraging. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So maybe just on international margins. The first time, I think, many of your markets actually showed profitability in the quarter. So I just wanted to get some color on what the key drivers of that improvement were in the quarter, how sustainable that improvement is? And if you look at the overall gross margins for the company in that 55%, do you think this is, at least, the sustainable level, at least for the foreseeable future?
Rodney C. Sacks: I think that Europe -- I think the improved profitability came from, I think, better distribution in -- largely, in existing accounts. I think we still have an opportunity to increase distribution in numerical number in additional accounts. So we've been trying to focus on improving the quality of distribution and we will continue to do so. And also, in some of the markets that are becoming more mature, we also, as we indicated earlier, we did review our operating model and took down some of the -- some of our marketing and costs that we had spent in establishing the brands in those markets. We felt that we were able to do so going forward, and so we will continue to do so on an ongoing basis.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Then just maybe on some of your innovation that you've have called out in the call. I guess the last comment you made at the shareholder meeting was really trying to be maybe more thoughtful about innovation and, perhaps, thinking about innovation being more incremental to your brand portfolio. So if you can help us kind of -- how you think about the upcoming innovation? Do you really think this is now more incremental to your existing portfolio? And as you go into the market, kind of thinking about how you would approach getting extra shelf space as opposed to taking one out and placing the new innovation with -- replacing with your existing brand?
Rodney C. Sacks: I think that, that is illustrated by the value we sort of believe in, for example, in the Punch Monster line. We believe there is a subset sort of set of energy, which is in Punch products. I believe that by focusing our brand back into that Punch line with 2 SKUs, it will, in fact, help us. It is, in fact, doing that. We believe we are increasing distribution on the Punch Monster line. It has taken a little bit of time to get the new graphics out. There are new flavors that are more fit the Punch profile a little bit, they've being tweaked a little bit. And so we believe that is more strategic and that will become a key subset for us. We also believe that -- and many years ago, when we had the Juice Monster product, we rolled them out and -- but I think there were less sort of strategically focused as being a subset. And again, we had some fall-offs just because they became older and less-exciting and people went on to newer and more exciting things. So we've -- Khaos has continued to do well, but the -- and maybe started a little bit -- it was probably a little bit too heavy as a drink. So again, we've looked -- people are really turning to, we believe, lighter, easier-to-drink product. So again, the focus that we've had is in changing and reducing the juice content of our drinks because the -- and maybe sort of had a connotation to that, added percent juice. We've taken the juice content down quite substantially. So we've changed the name to Ripper, which is in line with the -- that, basically, product that we have overseas. So again, we've now clearly delineated what the product is. They're in very bright-colored cans. They've got texture on them. We believe they'll stand out on their own. There will be 2 Juice Monsters. And once we can solidify some distribution losses that we had on M-80, which is now Ripper, and get the line into a solid distribution, at position, we will then strategically, probably, expand that line with one more juice product. But again, there is a strategy behind it. We think there is a place that it can go, but it needs to be able to be identified separately. It shouldn't blend in with the larger line now because there are many SKUs, and it should have its own identity. So those are, again, in the process of getting -- rolling out new product cans, which we think are really, really attractive, as well as having lighter, lower-content juice flavors, which we believe are far more drinkable and easily drinkable because they are still carbonated. Again, we've been -- we think we've been strategic. We understand what's been happening to the Ultra line. It's been very successful. And again, we've -- we're going to introduce a selected one this year, which is Ultra Sunrise. We have plans to introduce another one next year. We're going to decide on that. We're also going to go through a test on a summer promotion with our Ultra Black. Test that flavor. See how that flavor does and see how the product does. And either that will be the line extension for next year or we'll have another one, which we have in test at the moment. Internally, we'll make a decision on that. So that's really where I wanted to look at that. The Ultra Sunrise is, in fact, a very similar product to what we did in Europe with the Rossi can. The Rossi can, again, although it says summer promotion, and that has been our strategy for it, strategically, as we see the success of that can, we have the opportunity if we want to, obviously, to turn that into a more permanent SKU. It's called the Doctor, which is the nickname for Rossi, but -- the name by which he is known. It is a full-calorie drink. The Ultra Sunrise here is a low-calorie or 0-calorie drink so -- but the flavor profile is all the same. We think that's a great flavor profile. And so we think that those will -- both products will play well. Rossi is not as well-known. MotoGP is not as popular sport in the U.S. as in Europe, and so we believe that the Rossi product is more appropriate for Europe. It still gives us an opportunity, obviously, to use -- to introduce Ultra and the extensions, including Ultra Sunrise in Europe later. But for the moment, we were looking to see where we want to go with the Rossi product and then the Ultra Sunrise here. We also have 1 or 2 line extensions. We repositioned our Rehab line, which has been a little soft, and we've really emphasized and changed the can emphasis on the fact that it's an iced tea and an iced tea lemonade line. That is the focus. We've -- obviously, strategically, we're going out to secure distribution of that line in the tea door. And that's how we're trying to obviously obtain more real estate for our brands and to get -- improve the depth of distribution. As we go through that, we are revising some of the flavors and tweaking them in the Rehab line, and we probably are planning to introduce one more Rehab product next year. So again, that's the sort of line in which we are following on product innovation. I don't want to go too much into detail of what we might do in the future. But we also are looking at introducing I think it's one more product in the Java Monster line. The Java line is doing nicely. We have, again -- we've strategically reformulated and repositioned the Kona Cappuccino line. It was in a darker can. I think the Kona, sort of -- it was a little bit confusing to consumers because we had a Kona blend, which is our original product, which is simply a good quality but an original basic quality coffee product. And the -- so we've now changed the graphics, again tweaked the formula and made it in a very much larger can, in line with the multi-content in it. So we have a cappuccino product, which we are rolling out now with the new graphics. So those changes, we believe, are really -- they may seem small, but they've been done carefully, and we think that's important because when you look at our distribution levels, we still believe we have a lot of low-hanging fruit in the line extensions that have substantially less distribution than the top view. And we believe that, that will continue to help drive improved sales and profitability.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.
Kevin M. Grundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: So Rodney, my question is on broadly the energy drink category in the U.S., and we've seen some slowing here, and you look at the Nielsen data in the convenience and gas channel, and we've gone from low-double-digit growth to about mid-single-digit growth in the category. So my question is broadly, what is your consumer research telling you that's driving the slowdown here? What are your expectations for the balance of the back half of the year? Do you think that innovation is going to help drive an acceleration? And just broadly here, are you getting the sense now that some of the consumer health concerns that are hitting the carbonated soft drink market are kind of seeping into consumers' awareness here as well?
Rodney C. Sacks: Yes. We really don't have any market research on what is driving the trends. We obviously see the continued soft trend across beverages in general. We think that the Energy category is being slowed down a little bit by the negative growth that is being experienced by 5-Hour, which is an energy shot. We lump it in the same sort of category. So we think that is pulling down a little bit of the growth as well. The growth would be higher without the energy shots in the category as a category. But overall, we are just seeing that slowing trend. We think that it's -- it seems to be around the world. It seems to have slowed a little bit as well in some of the -- in most of the international markets. But we believe that eventually that will sort of settle down and ride itself. We think there have been some health concerns about CSDs, and then the CSDs have now translated into the dark CSDs, so illogically, because of some scares about sweetness. Again, we think this too will pass, and I think things will settle down. But there are certainly some changing consumer trends and preferences. And those are something that, I think, we'll deal with them. We will deal with some of them, I think, by adapting our products to be more drinkable, to be lighter, lighter in calories and lighter in taste. And that's the sort of profile that we have for the Ultra line, and that's what we're now doing in reformulating the juice line. On the other hand, there are a lot of -- a majority of consumers still like full-flavored, heavy-bodied drink, just as they like light wines, and they like heavy wines. So we're trying to obviously cater for the full gamut of consumers, and that is the reason we introduced Muscle Monster. We think there is a trend for consumers, again, on a broader-based and pure sports people or bodybuilders to actually have drinks with protein in addition to the having the energy component, and that is why we introduced that line. So these are lines that are starting to solidify themselves, and we think that they will continue to grow. And we have -- I think we're well-positioned because of the broad range of our line to actually address this as we go. But we don't have any specific ideas as to why some of these of things are happening. I think a lot of the beverage companies would like to be able to have a crystal and see, but we just don't.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ms. Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I just have a first quick follow up question on Ultra Sunrise specifically. Is your goal to merchandise this new product within the CSD door? And then how realistic do you think this will be if, in fact, that is your strategy?
Rodney C. Sacks: This product has got nothing to do with CSDs. It has nothing to do with CSDs. It's got nothing to do with Mountain Dew. This product is going to be merchandised in the Energy door with the other Ultra products. It is a citrus flavor, probably more aligned into an orange flavor. It's got nothing -- it's not designed to address Mountain Dew or Kickstart in any way. It is simply a lighter -- 0-calorie and a lighter-tasting and refreshing and easier-drinking energy drink, completely in line with the original Ultra White product. The whole Ultra line mantra is the same. That is the subset that we are focusing on. And we're not changing the characteristics of that product at all. So if anything, our product is probably -- this product is aligned more to an Orangina-type of flavor profile. And -- which is similar to, again, to the Rossi can, and not to any of the other CSDs.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan from Stiefel.
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: So 2 questions on international. First, what drove the slowdown on easier comparisons, which continued into July? Could you quantify the impact from timing and/or destocking? And then secondly, can you quantify the impact on international growth broadly from your focus on profitability?
Rodney C. Sacks: I think there were a couple of factors that occurred in July. We don't want to go into more details because it is a single month. But -- and it varies quite dramatically. We believe that a lot of the factors that happened in July will not recur and it will make itself up into August, so we're not particularly concerned with it. But we really don't want to go into more detail on that front. It really was mainly destocking and movement and changes in production from one month to another because some of the production -- or some, actually, it's on an increasing level of production, is being handled in some cases by our distributors. And so their planning cycles are not necessarily linked to our sales and they will produce when they have gaps in production or when they feel they need it and we all find it and we try to smooth it out with them. But if we are finding that they were overproducing one period and then go down in inventory levels to another month, and then suddenly, the beginning of the month, start up again. And that is having quite a dramatic effect on some of our numbers on a month-to-month basis. Internationally, generally, we're starting to see some slowing but we've also tried to focus on getting many of the countries profitable. We will look again to accelerating sales but focusing on the bottom line and ensuring that we don't go back into the red in those countries. And so we're trying to just balance that through. We think that there has been some slowdown, but many of the international markets are really doing very well and starting to improve. Sales, for example in -- although we had a slowdown in international in July, and as I indicated, the actual sales in the USA were actually higher than the average company sales, the sales out in many of our markets, particularly in EMEA, from our distributors to customers, were up actually in the double digits in the EMEA in July. But our sales to our customers were substantially lower than that. So it's just a mismatch in July of some of those numbers.
Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Bill Chappell from SunTrust.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Just wanted to follow-up on the gross margin side and just -- was there a big contribution from local manufacturing in Japan and elsewhere? And is that expected to kind of continue as you open up in Korea and India? Or I mean, have we seen kind of most of the gains this quarter?
Rodney C. Sacks: We think that the effect of local production in Japan was substantial and that really did help us. Sweetener cost was a big contributor as well as we started packing again at Dr Pepper in Texas, which also helped us -- we had stopped for a period of time, which was also beneficial. As we go forward, as we said, Japan is now onstream, where we're launching M3 in Japan, we're launching that with the local production from the get go. When we launch Coffee Monster in Japan, that will be locally produced. So again, that is being improved. We have had some challenges in getting going in Korea and South Africa with local production, getting their production up to speed and up to our quality, and same thing in India. We're all working with it and we're all making progress. And as those countries come on board, it will obviously improve the results there quite substantially. We recently expanded our production facilities in Europe by adding another facility, which we have approved. And so as we continue to really rollout and become more well -- better well-established overseas, we clearly will continue to derive the benefits from better production in those countries. And also, the other thing that will help with our margin, Bill, was just mentioned back there, it was lower allowances. We were able to achieve these sales by not having to go as deep with our CMAs and other allowances we've had historically provided to retailers. We think that we will be able to manage that on a similar level going forward.
Operator: And there are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the call back over to Rodney Sacks for closing remarks. Mr. Sacks, please go ahead.
Rodney C. Sacks: Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continue to develop and differentiate our brands, and to expand the company both at home and abroad. We reiterate that our products are safe, are properly labeled, and the caffeine content of a Monster is approximately 10 milligrams per ounce. It's less than half the milligrams per ounce of caffeine level that's contained in Starbucks and other coffee house brewed coffee. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Corporation First Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. [operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Rodney Sacks. Sir, you may begin.
Rodney C. Sacks: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice President and President is -- our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company, that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed March 3, 2014, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements, for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during this course -- the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated May 8, 2014. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section We reiterate that our products are safe. More than 10 billion Monster Energy drinks have been sold and safely consumed around the world over the past 12 years. The long history of safe use of products containing caffeine in the U.S. has remained unchanged. Recent studies confirm that the average amount of caffeine consumed by the U.S. population has remained relatively stable despite the entry of energy drinks into the market. As previously indicated and stated by the FDA in 2012, available studies do not indicate any new previously unknown risks associated with caffeine consumption, although the FDA has continued to explore whether additional research on caffeine or energy drinks is needed. The Institute of Medicine held a public workshop in August 2013, in Washington, D.C. to help determine whether there were potential health hazards associated with the consumption of caffeine in food and dietary supplements. In January 2014, the IOM forwarded a report of the proceedings to the FDA. Many studies conducted in recent years in the U.S.A., Canada and Europe, including a very recent study, have all consistently concluded that the principal sources of caffeine, for teens under 18, are coffee, soft drinks and tea, and not energy drinks. In fact, the recent article published by -- in the Journal of Pediatrics analyzed the consumption data. Even after including young adults, aged 19 to 22 years, in the most recent 2-year period study, 2009 to 2010, only some 6% of the caffeine consumed by all persons 22 and under was from energy drinks, as compared to 24% from coffee and 38% from soda. If young adults aged 19 to 22 are excluded as they are neither children nor adolescents, the percentages are even lower with the result of less than 3% of the caffeine intake for children and adolescents 18 and under comes from energy drinks. To put the level of caffeine in Monster Energy drinks in context, we, again, remind listeners that a medium Starbucks 16-ounce large brewed coffee contains approximately 350 milligrams of caffeine, which is more than double the approximately 160 milligrams of caffeine that is contained in the same-sized Monster Energy drink. On April 30, 2014, the American Beverage Association formally adopted new U.S. model guidelines for energy drink companies that are supported by the company, as well as all the other major energy drink companies in the U.S.A. In the litigation between the company and the city attorney of San Francisco, the company recently filed a motion to strike allegations in the complaint, challenging the theory for relief previously rejected by the court, as well as a motion to bifurcate and/or stake of claim relating to the safety of Monster Energy drinks pending resolution of the ongoing FDA investigation on the safety and labeling of food products to which caffeine is added. These motions are calendared for hearing on May 21, 2014. In the Kona federal securities case that has been pending since 2008, the company entered into a stipulation of settlement on April 16, 2014, that, if approved by the court, will resolve the litigation and result in the action being dismissed with prejudice. The proposed settlement contains no admission of liability or wrongdoing on the part of any of the defendants, each of whom continues to deny all the allegations. The full amount of the settlement will be paid by the company's insurers -- insurance carriers. The company assumes no obligation to update any statements made with respect to ongoing litigation and regulatory matters, including with respect to the foregoing disclosures, whether as to new information, future events or otherwise other than as required by law. Given the current litigation and pending regulatory requests, will refrain from answering questions or commenting further on these specific subjects. We are happy, of course, to answer questions that you may have about our products in general, or about the first quarter as best as we can, after we have concluded our discussion on the business. Turning to the business. In the first quarter of 2014, the beverage market, generally, in the U.S.A. continued to experience softness. In contrast, the energy drinks sector in the U.S.A. grew in the high-single digits. In the first quarter, the company achieved record growth sales, up 10.6% to $613.7 million and net sales up 10.7% to $536.1 million. Sales of our Ultra line continued to improve during the quarter, while sales of our Muscle Monster line continue to gain traction. Sales of our Monster Original Green Energy Drink also increased in the quarter. According to Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through March 15, 2014, in the convenience and gas channel, Muscle Monster was the second best-selling brand in the protein supplement sector and achieved a 23.1% market share. Although Muscle Monster's ATV distribution levels have improved, they are still relatively low at approximately 56%. We are working with our distributor partners to improve these levels. We believe that as we achieve increased distribution levels for that line, Muscle Monster's market share will continue to improve. We are pleased with the sales achieved in the first quarter. Our revenues were affected by less robust growth rates for the energy category, as a whole, in certain of our overseas markets, including within EMEA, and especially Eastern Europe, increased distribution of sales in the U.S.A. of our Ultra line, as well as new Muscle Monster line, sales in the U.S. of our Ultra line were low accretive did result in some cannibalization, generally across our existing SKUs, primarily Absolutely Zero and Lo-Carb. The sales of Monster Energy products in glass bottles in the U.S.A. were lower during the quarter. Our operating income was up 38.7% to $148.9 million. During the first quarter, our operating income was negatively affected by professional services costs of $5 million related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the company's marketing, promotions, ingredients, labeling and safety of its Monster Energy drinks, which we believe are exceptional in nature. Diluted earnings per share increased 49% from $0.37 per share in the first quarter of 2013 to $0.55 per share in the first quarter of 2014. Distributed terminations were 0.01 million in the 2014 first quarter compared to 8.3 million in the corresponding quarter last year. Net income was reduced by foreign currency losses of about $200,000 this quarter as opposed to $4.7 million in the same quarter last year. The effective tax rate decreased from 39.8% to 36.1%, which was primarily the result of profits earned in certain foreign subsidiaries that have no related tax expense as a result of the prior establishment of valuation allowances on their deferred tax assets. The effect on diluted earnings per share of professional services costs related to regulatory matters and related litigation, net of tax, is approximately $0.02 per share. According to Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through April 26, 2014, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including Shots, increased by 6.8% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 15.1% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 4%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 4.7%, and sales of 5-Hour decreased by 3.2%. Sales of AMP were down 12.3%, NOS increased sales by 26.3%, and sales of Full Throttle increased 5.7%. According to Nielsen reports for the 4 weeks ended April 26, 2014, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel, in dollars, increased by 6.7% over the comparable period in 2013. Sales of Monster increased by 13.4% over the comparable period last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 2.8%. Rockstar was up 2.6% while 5-Hour was down 1.7%. NOS was up 24.7% and AMP was down 7.7%. According to Nielsen for the 4 weeks ended April 26, 2014, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 2.1 points over the comparable period a year ago to 35.4% against Red Bull's share, which was lower at 34.5%. Rockstar's share was lower at 7%, 5-Hour's share was lower at 9.2%, while NOS share was higher at 3.3%. According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended April 26, 2014, sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel increased 12.8% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 7.1% higher than in the comparable period last year, while Starbucks Double Shot energy was 21.7% higher. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel, in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended March 8, 2014, the energy drink category grew 2%. Monster sales increased 11%. Our market share increased 2.4 points to 28.3% over the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales increased 1% and its market share decreased 0.5 point to 36.6%. Rockstar sales increased to 12% and its market share increased 1.5 points to 16.9%. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined, in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 14.5% in the month of March 2014. Monster sales increased 23.3%. Our market share increased 2.6 points to 37.1% against the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales decreased 19.2%, and its market share decreased by 11 points -- 11.1 points to 26.5%. Boost sales increased 42.9% and its market share increased 3.1 points to 15.7%. And Vivo 100, new in 2013, has grown to 8.5% market share, while Coke's market share represented by Burn and Gladiator decreased 3.1 points to 9.3%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced, positively or negatively, by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 11.8% to $514.4 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2014, from $460.2 million in the same period in 2013. Operating income for the DSD segment increased 34.2% from $139 million to $186.5 million. Gross sales from original Monster Green Energy Drink continued to increase in the quarter as did sales of Java Monster. However, the increase in sales of these products, together with the sales of our Ultra and Muscle Monster lines, as well as certain other Monster Energy products, was partially offset by lower sales of certain Monster SKUs, including Monster Energy Absolutely Zero, Lo-Carb Monster Energy, the Monster Rehab line and Import. Net sales of our Peace Tea line were higher. Net sales for the company's warehouse segment decreased 9.5% to $21.8 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2014, mainly due to the reduced sales of Hubert's Lemonade, in part, due to a purchase last year by a large customers that was not repeated in the same quarter this year. Operating income decreased from $0.4 million to $0.3 million in this quarter. For the 3 months ended March 31, 2014, gross sales to retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 4% of gross sales, up from 3% in the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 9% of sales, down from 10% in 2013. Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 62% of sales, the same as in the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales internationally were consistent at 23%. Other sales at 2% for the period were also consistent with the comparable period in 2013. Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the first quarter of 2014 amount to $144.3 million compared to $130.7 million in the same quarter in 2013. Included in such sales are sales to company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the first quarter of 2014, in dollars, were 5.2% higher than the same period last year. Net sales in Europe and the Middle East alone were 9.3% higher than the same period last year. As I mentioned in our conference call on February 27, in anticipation of the introduction of a sales tax on energy drinks in France on January 1, 2014, our distributor in France increased its purchases in the fourth quarter of 2013 by an estimated $3 million and which we estimated resulted in a reduction in our sales to our French distributor in the first quarter of 2014 by a similar amount. We have implemented a formula change for our products sold in France to address this tax. We estimate that as a result, our sales in Europe were negatively affected in the quarter by about 4.2%. Sales from our distributor in South Africa during the quarter were also negatively impacted by a price increase in South Africa, which took effect over a few months in 2013, as well as the shift in timing of a promotion with a large retailer from the first quarter of 2013 to the second quarter of 2014. Monster continues to gain momentum and increase its market share at retail in Europe, and in particular in the United Kingdom, Spain, Greece, Sweden, Belgium, France, Germany and Hungary, as well as in South Africa. Group progress is made in Western Europe and Africa in increased distribution levels and sales. While the Central and Eastern European market is still incurring operating losses, we are seeing improved results from the strategic changes we implemented during last year. Overall, our EMEA division traded profitably during the first quarter of 2014. The addition of Monster Ultra Blue and Ultra Red, as well as the launch of our Muscle Monster line in 2013, was successful. We're continuing with our expansion strategy in international markets. In addition, we are proposing to launch Monster in a limited number of countries in Asia, Central and Eastern Europe and Africa this year. Sales of the Monster Energy brand internationally, including Japan, in particular, continue to grow satisfactorily. Relative to the comparable quarter last year, the weaker yen negatively affected our growth sales in U.S. dollars, as well as our margins in Japan during the quarter. Sales to our Japanese distributor in the first quarter of 2014, both in yen and in dollars were higher than sales in the comparable quarter last year. Production in Japan has commenced and plan for production elsewhere in Asia continue to move forward. We are also moving ahead with our plans to produce Monster Energy drinks in India, as well as in South Africa. Sales in Chile continued to progress. Our distributor in Brazil continues to secure increased distribution from month-to-month. We are continuing with our strategy to secure local production in certain of our international markets in order to improve gross margins, reduce freight, reduce damages and assist in mitigating the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. Net sales of Peace Tea for the first quarter were higher than in the comparable period in 2013. We continue to believe that the Peace Tea brand has good growth potential and have added a mango juice cocktail to the line. We are planning to launch an iced coffee line in glass bottles under the Peace Tea brand later in 2014. In the Warehouse division, sales of Hubert's Lemonades in glass bottles for the first quarter of 2014 were lower compared to last year, largely due to a purchase by large customer last year that was not repeated in the same quarter this year. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales achieved in the first quarter of 2014 was 53.5% versus 52.1% in the comparable quarter in 2013. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to a small decrease in allowances and lower cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales. Gross profit percentage achieved in the first quarter in North America in 2014 was higher than in the comparable quarter last year. Gross profit percentages achieved outside North America for Monster Energy were lower in the first quarter of 2014 than in the comparable quarter in 2013. We have covered a significant portion of our anticipated requirements for aluminum cans in 2014, as well as a significant portion of our anticipated requirements for apple juice and sugar over the same period. We do not believe that, at current levels, increases in cost of any raw materials will have a material negative effect on our margins. Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales in the first quarter were 4.7% versus 4.6% in the comparable quarter in 2013. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 10.7% in the quarter versus 13.5% in the comparable period in 2013. While sponsorships and endorsement costs, as well as commissions were higher, cost of premiums, allocated trade developments, social media and point-of-sale were lower during the quarter. Total general and administrative expenses decreased 3.3% in the first quarter. The decrease in general and administrative costs was primarily attributable to an $8.3 million decrease in distributed termination costs in the quarter. The decrease in general and administrative costs was partly offset by increased professional service costs for legal accounting and other professional costs. $2 million of the increase in the quarter related to regulatory matters and litigation regarding our Monster Energy drinks. Federal expenses and insurance costs also increased by approximately $3 million. Operating income increased 38.7% over operating income for the same period a year ago. We are continuing to work towards reducing our overall operating costs in our international markets. We recorded foreign currency exchange losses of $200,000 for the quarter as compared to $4.7 million in the same quarter last year. Our effective tax rate in the 2014 first quarter was 36.1% compared to 39.8% in the 2013 first quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of profits earned in foreign subsidiaries that have no related tax expense as a result of the prior establishment of valuation allowances on the deferred tax assets. During the 2014 first quarter, no share repurchases were made under the board authorized share repurchase program. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $312 million compared to $211.3 million at December 31, 2013. Short-term investments were $438.9 million compared to $402.2 million at December 31, 2013. Long-term investments, which are comprised of certain auction rate securities, decreased to $8.1 million from $9.8 million at December 31, 2013. Included in the long- and short-term investments are auction rate securities having a fair value of $14.5 million. Accounts receivable, net, increased to $342.1 million from $291.6 million at December 31, 2013. Days outstanding for trade account receivables were 50.5 days at March 31, 2014, and 50.4 days at March 31, 2013, compared to 42.5 days at December 31, 2013. Inventories decreased to $204.1 million from $221.4 million at December 31, 2013. Average days of inventory was 73.7 days at March 31, 2014, which was lower than the 83.5 days of inventory at March 31, 2013, and lower than the 75.6 days at December 31, 2013. We recently launched the new Punch Monster line by converting our existing 2 Dub Edition products into Punch Monster products with new can graphics and flavors. We are planning to launch new additions to the Monster family later in 2014. Gross sales in April 2014 were approximately 7.8% higher than in April 2013. We caution, again, that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately affected by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points: North American gross margins remain healthy. Our 2014 first quarter gross margins for North America were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2013; two, Nielsen market statistics show that energy category growth has recovered to the high single digits, and that Monster Energy's growth is still outpacing the growth of the category as a whole; three, new additions to the Monster family is that we're introduced during 2013 are continuing to gain market share and contributing positively to the overall increase in the company sales; four, we believe that our recently launched new Punch Monster line will appeal to a broader consumer demographic than the Dub Edition and will be positively received by distributors and consumers in 2014. Our new Strawberry and Peanut Butter Cup Muscle Monster Energy shakes are performing well and should further enhance the Muscle Monster line in 2014. Turning to international markets, we're pleased with the performance of our international expansion and investments, particularly Japan, United Kingdom, Spain, South Africa, Brazil and Chile. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period to the end of March 2014, the actual days of the 13-week period vary by a few days between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 18.7% to 21.1% in Spain; from 18.4% to 18.5% in South Africa; from 16.2% to 17.9% in France; from 18.6% to 27% in Greece; and from 7.9% to 8.1% in Germany. In Great Britain, Monster's retail market share value for the 4 weeks ending April 26 grew from 10.3% to 10.7% -- 10.8%. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country; Nine, it is noteworthy that even though the energy drink category has been in existence in Europe for over 26 years, our EMEA markets on average are still experiencing single-digit growth while Monster continues to grow in excess of the category; ten, sales of Monster in Japan are continuing to increase and remain encouraging. We have finally commenced production in Japan; 11, we were finally able to obtain a regulatory approval for the sale of Monster in India late last year. Sales in the quarter have progressed satisfactorily; 12, as advised by Ambev, distribution levels and their sales in Brazil to their customers continue to improve. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from John Faucher from JPMorgan.
John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Want to talk a little bit about the margin expansion in the quarter and, Rodney, can you talk a little bit about, particularly on the gross margin line, with the gross margin up a lot this quarter, how are you -- how should we look at that in terms of maybe some favorability of raw material trends versus some of the more structural changes you're making in terms of moving the manufacturing more to the local markets? And then, also, if you can give us a little bit more color on the SG&A leverage, which was very strong in the quarter. Are you finally getting to that point in some of these markets, you talked about European being positive, where you're really getting solid leverage on some of the marketing investment you've been making for the past couple of years?
Rodney C. Sacks: Well, let's just deal with the margins. I think, sales mix is clearly one of the most important factors that has influenced the margin change. This can be seen from the fact that we've had the very successful increase in sales of our Ultra margin -- Ultra line. The Ultra line cost-wise has a lower cost of goods than some of the other lines, particularly lines like the juice lines or any of the java lines or Muscle Monster lines. So when you weigh the numbers, clearly, that has helped our margins. And we also had, as we indicated earlier, some cost of goods as well. Also sales of Peace Tea, in many cases we've gone away from the $0.99 price, pre-priced cans, so our margins have improved slightly on Peace Teas. We've also been able to lower some freight expenses, we reinstated a co-packer in the Texas market, which is a pretty big market for our product, which, if you eliminated a lot of freight we were incurring in shipping product into that market from surrounding states. So when you take into account the fact that you're looking at the substantial volume we've actually been able to achieve, look at the Nielsen's on the Ultra line, and being a lower-cost item, that has primarily been the primary source of the extra margin. We also had to put of our pricing on 24-ounce and that is starting to show through on the margins as well. And that package is also starting to come back and do quite nicely. The -- with regard to the operating expenses, one of the large differences was incurred in basically the cost of premiums decreased due to the gear promo, which was very successful promotion we've done in past years, but it was costly promotion, in supplying gear and sending it out to consumers. And so we had alternative promotions this year, which we felt were good, but didn't involve us in having to contribute as much back to the consumer through benefits. So that helped us quite a bit. We also, as we indicated, we sort of basically took a closer look at International Operations. We pulled back on a number of expense items, some sampling and sales people in the markets. We also pulled back on some sponsorship opportunities and promotions internationally, with the result that we -- overall, we've just been able to, in fact, reduce our selling expenses, which has been very fortunate for us. If we just look at -- we also have the effect, as we indicated earlier, of the distributed termination costs, which is a large item, which hit our P&L last year in the comparable quarter. So clearly, we are getting to a point now with the steps we've taken to operate more leanly overseas. We are getting positive profits from Europe now and we actually -- we believe we will continue that sort of trend going forward.
Operator: And our next question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel.
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: I guess, I wanted to dive a bit deeper into the April number, the plus 7.8%. Maybe just talk a bit about what you're seeing from a trend standpoint that resulted in what seems to be a pretty good deceleration for a first quarter, and maybe, just more broadly, how you're looking at trends through the first quarter and into April, given the January number was also better than what the overall first quarter sales number came in at.
Rodney C. Sacks: Yes, I think, again, in this month, in particular, I think, you got to take into account that these are one monthly numbers. We've seen some non-matching trends when you look at things like Nielsen because we basically find that we don't work to timing a particular month. And if you take, for example -- we've seen some destocking or just managing of entire inventories from our distributors. Again, we -- in many cases, we don't have visibility to their stock, but for example, I'll give you one example. In 2013, the short lead orders, which are orders that are placed -- they're require shipment within 6 or 7 days, last year, we received from CCR a total of 42 orders, which was 1.3% of the total orders got into the we-urgently-need-inventory category. In 2014, the short orders -- short lead orders had increased to 272 orders, which was 6.7% of the total orders. We believe they are -- they have reduced inventories and are managing their inventories much more tightly, but the result is that, that means that they've run out inventories more quickly on this, and then they need these urgent orders to replace them. But again, most of our distributors and bottle partners we don't have visibility on their stock policies. Sometimes, you get some idea, we have a feeling about it but we don't always. So I think that what is important to us ultimately is the trends that you see from the Nielsens, which are really showing consumer demand at the retail level. That's showing the pull-through from month-to-month. And we think that. When you look on a longer-term basis, those are more indicative of the trends than looking at the one monthly numbers. But -- and that's why we do have that caution because really is something we need to be cautious about.
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And maybe if you could just touch on sort of sequential trends through first quarter. And then just sort of a related question, how much was the FX impact on the international revenue growth line? And inclusive of that, what was the Japan impact?
Rodney C. Sacks: I think that was about 0.5% -- it's about a 0.5% higher, yes.
Operator: . Our next question comes from Amit Sharma from Bank of Montréal.
Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Can you talk about -- and this is a follow-up to what John was asking in the international profitability, I mean, you mentioned that Europe is now positive and also some tax benefits from profitability in some international markets. Can you give us some idea where profitability is in some of your key markets and which of them are now profitable versus not making money?
Rodney C. Sacks: I think we've -- we have broken it down to as much as we want to, we don't break it -- we're not going to break it down any further. Because the other markets are really new and they're choppy. They're being affected by many factors where you do promotions, where you've got -- we do have issues with foreign exchange and goods damages and shipping costs. Like for example, with Japan, we're now right in throes of changing over to local production so we think that will have a big effect. But the tale of the issues we've been facing, affect these numbers quite dramatically. And for that reason, we think that it really wasn't -- it's not appropriate to break it out into the other markets here. We have focused on the main international area at the moment, which was Europe, which we've gone positive and that's, I think, a very important turning point for the company. We believe that as the other markets starts to settle down, we start to be able to get local production, those results will also improve as we go forward.
Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. And then the tax benefit that you had during the quarter, is that sustainable through the rest of the quarters as well, the lower tax?
Rodney C. Sacks: We think regarding [indiscernible] it's probably pretty much up.
Hilton H. Schlosberg: As long as there's profitability off season, yes.
Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Got it. Okay. And then...
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers with UBS.
Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I guess, so going -- first, going back to what you're saying regarding channel inventory relative to Nielsen trends, which have been stronger, at this point, do you feel there's still essentially excess inventory to work through from your distributors or are you seeing more of a catch-up that's yet to come as the year progresses?
Rodney C. Sacks: It's -- again, it's something which we really don't have the visibility on, but we have seen this trend. And it gets to a point where, obviously, we are seeing -- it's not going to be able to go on forever. But -- and as we believe they are likely to start getting more in line. But that -- we're just facing our sales. And unfortunately, people look at the Nielsens in advance, and then obviously you look at our sales and then you do the comparison all the time. They just really are not comparable. There's various reasons why we don't necessarily match all the time, particularly in newer markets where you're starting a new market, your customer may order too much or may order to little. And then, you have a catch-up, and then he gets pipeline, and then the next year, he's got a sales trend, and then all these factors that continue to influence the relationship between Nielsen. As you get to more stable markets, long mark to [indiscernible] they do have -- start to have a much closer correlation but even in the U.S. nets that I alluded to, we have this situation now where we do feel we have -- there has been a realignment by our larger customers to try and manage down their inventories, and that has an effect on our sales versus when you look at the market. Obviously, there are other issues in the market that also change, which is timing, but that would be the main reason we feel.
Operator: And our next question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I guess, Rodney, I guess, I just wanted to circle back on the April number I don't want to really get this into too much -- just understanding it's just one month. But what I'm hearing from you is that from a consumer kind of takeaway, all the trends that you're seeing, both at Europe from your brands and in the category levels seem to be relatively healthy. The full down [ph] really appears to be driven by the inventory movement at your wholesalers, primarily in the U.S. market. Are there any other markets that you're seeing this inventory kind of disconnect continuing? I think, in the second quarter, or sorry, the first quarter, you said Japan was up year-over-year. I think Asahi had numbers up by 40% so I'm just trying to reconcile what's happening in the U.S. from underlying versus inventory, and then also some of the international markets.
Rodney C. Sacks: Yes. If you take the -- basically, South America and Asia Pacific markets, in the month, those were down. But if you take, which is the point I made and our sales were down because of timing, or mistiming whatever the case -- whatever you want to put it, of purchases, when we went to new distributor last year, and it was very choppy. So you end up with one month where there was a high level of purchases coming out of Brazil, and then this month, you end up with a much lower level. But if you go through the numbers, and you look at the sales out of that distributor in Brazil, and that is one particular distributor where we do have some visibility on their sales numbers. Their sales numbers have continued to grow and are substantially higher than last year. But our sales into them, in April, specifically, are negative. And if you take the Asia Pacific, it's not only -- it's largely Japan but then there are a lot of other markets in that one month while we were up in the quarter, we were negative in that month. And that was part of that transition month where we changed over from supplying goods made in the U.S. to local production. So again, we believe that will change as we go forward during the quarter. But those had -- those 2 markets had quite an effect on the April number. The April number would have been quite a few percentage points higher if you take -- if you just take into account sales in, basically, North America and Europe, or EMEA, as we put it. So we're quite comfortable with the numbers going forward. We think the categories showing pretty resilient and healthy signs. And as you can pick up from the Nielsen, that really is the best indicator of ultimate consumer demand for the brand and for the category.
Operator: . And our next question comes from Caroline Levy from CLSA.
Brian Doyle - CLSA Limited, Research Division: This is Brian Doyle, filling in for Caroline. I was just wondering -- just on international profitability, again, you said EMEA is now profitable. I was wondering if you could just update us on how big that is as a percentage of your total international revenue. And then, secondly, just on the international gross margin, I was kind of surprised that it was down in the quarter. My first thought that, that would largely be currency-related, but it sounds like currency was only like 0.5 point hit to the top line, so just a little clarity on when the sort of international margins are going to improve.
Rodney C. Sacks: It's -- at the moment, it's -- the actual net margins are small in relation to the sales. It's just basically at the beginning of turning the corner. And we -- as we go forward, we believe we will continue to improve there, but we do have thinner margins overseas. We did indicate, I think earlier, that our gross margins overseas were slightly less than its comparable periods last year. And we're looking to, again, trying to deal with -- address that. Again, we think some of that will be addressed as we look for -- go forward. One of the things we will be looking to do is to introduce new products where we believe we will have better margins internationally as we expand the product range overseas. So we, obviously, are looking to try and improve those margins, but at this point a lot of that will depend on our ability to get our cost down.
Operator: . Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the call back over to your host, Rodney Sacks, for any further remarks.
Rodney C. Sacks: On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continue to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company, both at home and abroad. We reiterate our products are safe, our frothy labels and the caffeine contents of a Monster at approximately 10 milligrams per ounce is less than 1/2 the milligrams per ounce of the caffeine levels contained in Starbucks and other coffeehouse brewed coffee. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude your program. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Corporation Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2013 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Mr. Sacks, you may begin.
Rodney C. Sacks: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1954 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company, that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed March 1, 2013, as well as our most recent report on Form 10-Q filed November 8, 2013, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements, for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated February 27, 2014. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. We reiterate that our products are safe and are pleased to report that more than 10 billion Monster Energy drinks have been sold and safely consumed around the world over the past 12 years. The long history of safe use of products containing caffeine in the U.S. has remained unchanged. Studies confirm that the average amount of caffeine consumed by the U.S. population has remained relatively stable, despite the entry of energy drinks into the market. As previously indicated, and as stated by the FDA in 2012, available studies did not indicate any new, previously unknown risks associated with caffeine consumption, although the FDA has continued to explore whether additional research on caffeine or energy drinks is needed. The Institute of Medicine held a public workshop in August 2013 in Washington, D.C. to help determine whether there were potential health hazards associated with the consumption of caffeine in food and dietary supplements. In January 2014, the IM forwarded a copy of the proceedings to the FDA. Many studies conducted in recent years in the U.S.A., Canada and Europe, including a very recent study, have all consistently concluded that the principal sources of caffeine for teens under 18 are coffee, soft drinks and tea and not energy drinks. In fact, a recent article published in the Journal of Pediatrics analyzed the consumption data. Even after including young adults aged 19 to 22 years in the most recent 2-year period study, that's 2009 to 2010, only some 6% of the caffeine consumed by all persons, 22 and under, was from energy drinks as compared to 24% from coffee and 38% from soda. If young adults aged 19 to 22 are excluded as they are neither children nor adolescents, the percentages are even lower with the result at less than 3% of the caffeine intake of children and adolescents, 18 and under, comes from energy drinks. To put of the level of caffeine in Monster Energy drinks in context, we again remind listeners that a medium Starbucks 16-ounce sized brewed coffee contains approximately 330 milligrams of caffeine, which is more than double the approximately 160 milligrams of caffeine that is contained in the same-sized Monster Energy drink. In the litigation between the company and the City Attorney of San Francisco, the company recently filed the demurrer to and motion to strike allegations in the complaint. The demurrer and motion to strike were currently scheduled for a hearing on March 4, 2014. Subsequent to the last conference call, the court issued a final ruling dismissing the amended complaint filed in the purported class action against the company, in which 3 individuals challenged the safety of Monster Energy drinks and the marketing activities of the company. The plaintiffs have filed an appeal against that decision. The American Beverage Association is awaiting a response from certain senators to the proposed U.S. model guidelines for energy drink companies that are described in our last conference call. We continue to support the proposed model guidelines and would be prepared to adopt them if all other major energy drink companies doing business in the U.S. do the same. With respect to the Kona Federal Securities case that has been pending since 2008, we are currently negotiating the terms of a possible settlement of the action, following a mediation conducted by an independent mediator. Any potential settlement, if completed, will be fully paid by insurance and will not have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position or results of operations. The company assumes no obligation to update any statements made with respect to ongoing litigation and regulatory matters, including with respect to the foregoing disclosures whether as to new information, future events or otherwise, other than as required by law. Given the current litigation and pending regulatory requests, we will refrain from answering questions or commenting further on these specific subjects. We are happy, of course, to answer questions that you may have about our products in general or about the fourth quarter and 2013 full year results as best we can after we've concluded our discussion on the business. Turning to the business. In the fourth quarter of the 2013, the beverage market, generally in North America continued to experience softness, not only in traditional CSDs, but even more so in diets. In contrast, the energy drink sector grew in the high-single-digits. Positive sales momentum of our Ultra line continued during the fourth quarter. According to the Nielsen reports, sales of Ultra Red, which we introduced in September 2013, exceeded the sales of Ultra Blue in the 13 weeks through January 25, 2014, in the convenience and gas channel. Rehab Pink Lemonade also continued to progress and is now the second best-selling Rehab product. In fact, our 3 Ultra products are among our top 8 best-selling SKUs in the convenience and gas channel. Sales of our Muscle Monster line continued to gain traction. According to Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through December 21, 2013, in the convenience and gas channel, Muscle Monster was the second best-selling brand in the protein supplement sector and achieved a 22.8% market share. Although Muscle Monster's ATV distribution levels have improved, they are still relatively low at approximately 50%. We are working with our distributor partners to improve these levels. We are confident that as we achieve increased distribution levels for that line, Muscle Monster's market share will continue to improve. The company continued to make good progress in the fourth quarter and achieved record fourth quarter gross sales, up 14% to $621.1 million and net sales up 14.7% to $540.8 million. Although we are pleased with the sales achieved for the fourth quarter and year-ended December 31, 2013, our revenues were affected by: One, less robust growth rates for the energy category as a whole in certain of our overseas markets, such as EMEA. Despite the slower growth, Monster was able to achieve 15.2% growth in net sales in dollars in that region in the fourth quarter, well ahead of the growth of the category overall in that region. As measured by Nielsen, for of our EMEA markets and IRI for its measure Italy and Greece. The energy category in EMEA grew by 5.5% in value in the 13 weeks to the end of December 2013, while Monster grew 23% in value over that period. The actual days of the 13-week period vary by a few days between different markets. Two, sales were positively affected in the U.S.A. by the launch of our new Ultra Red energy drink, as well as sales of Zero Ultra and Ultra Blue and our new Muscle Monster line. Three, sales in the U.S.A. of our new Zero Ultra, Ultra Blue and Ultra Red energy drinks are lower accretive did result in some cannibalization generally across our existing SKUs primarily Absolutely Zero and Lo-Carb. Four, sales of Monster Energy protein glass bottles in the U.S.A. were lower during the quarter. Operating income was up 18.3% to $134.8 million. During the fourth quarter, our operating income was negatively affected by professional services costs of $4.7 million related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the company's marketing promotions, ingredients, labeling, and safety of its Monster Energy drinks, which we believe are exceptional in nature. Diluted earnings per share increased 13.7% from $0.39 per share in the fourth quarter of 2012 to $0.44 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013. Net income was also negatively affected by foreign currency losses of about $3.6 million, principally attributable to Japan and South Africa. And an increase in the effective tax rate to 42.2% from 39.1% last year, which was primarily the result of the establishment of a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries, as well as losses in certain foreign subsidiaries for which no tax benefit is recorded. We anticipate that the rates should return to a more normalized level in 2014. The net effect on diluted earnings per share of professional services costs related to regulatory matters and related litigation, foreign exchange losses and higher tax rate is approximately $0.07 per share. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through January 25, 2014, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including shots, increased by 7.6% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 17.9% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 6.3%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 3.3%. And sales of 5-Hour decreased by 2.8%. Sales of AMP were down 9%, NOS increased sales by 17.3% and sales of Full Throttle increased 3.5%. According to the Nielsen reports, for the 4 weeks ended January 25, 2014, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel, in dollars, increased by 6.6% over the comparable period in 2013. Sales of Monster increased by 14% over the comparable period last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 5.4%. Rockstar was up 7.5%, while 5-Hour was down 3.3%. NOS was up 11.7% and AMP was down 2.8%. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended January 25, 2014, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 2.2 points over the comparable period a year ago to 33.9% against Red Bull share points of 34.8%. Rockstar share was flat at 8.5%, 5-Hour's share was lower at 9.6%, while NOS' share was slightly higher at 3.1%. According to Nielsen, in the 4-weeks ended January 25, 2014, sales of energy plus coffee drinks, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel increased 7.1% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 6.3% higher than in the comparable period last year while Starbucks Double Shot Energy was 9.3% higher. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended January 11, 2014, the energy drink category grew 3%, Monster sales increased 21%. Our market share increased 4.6 points to 31% over the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales were flat versus a year ago, its market share decreased 1.3 points to 36.6%. Rockstar's sales decreased 3% and its market share decreased 0.9 to 13.6%. According to Nielsen, with all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 22.6%. In the month of December 2013, Monster sales increased 20.9%. Our market share decreased 0.5 to 35.1% against the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales increased 2.6% and its market share decreased by 5.6% to 28.4%. Boost sales increased 35% and its market share increased 1.5 points to 16.5%. Vivo 100, new in 2013, has grown to 7.8% market share, while Coke market share represented by Burn and Gladiator is 9.5%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn could be materially impressed by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 15.2% to $519.4 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2013, from $451 million in the same period in 2012. Operating income for the DSD segment increased to 22.2% from $145.6 million to $177.9 million. Sales of our Monster Original Green Energy Drink continued to increase in the quarter as did sales of Java Monster. However, the increase in sales of these products, together with the sales of our Ultra Muscle Monster line, as well as certain other Monster energy products was partially offset by lower sales of certain Monster SKUs, including Lo-Carb Monster Energy, Monster Energy Absolutely Zero, certain of the Rehab, Monster Rehab drinks, Monster Import and Khaos. Sales of Monster [indiscernible] and Peace Tea taker multipacks did not meet our expectations and we are winding down our sales of these products. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment increased 4.5% to $21.4 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2013. Sales of juice boxes and Hubert's Lemonades were higher but were partially offset by reduced sales of sodas. The warehouse division experienced an operating loss of $1 million in the quarter compared to an operating loss of $300,000 in the same period last year, largely as a result of lower gross profit due to the impact of increased cost of apple juice concentrate, as well as higher promotional allowances. For the 3 months ended December 31, 2013, gross sales to retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 4% of gross sales, up from 3% in the comparable period in 2012, gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 8% of sales, down from 9% in 2012. Gross sales to full service distributors represented 64% of sales, lower than the 65% in 2012. Gross sales internationally increased to 22% from 21% in the same period in 2012. And other sales were 2% for the period, the same as in the comparable period in 2012. Gross sales to customers outside of the United States in the fourth quarter of 2013 amounted to $137.9 million compared to $115.2 million in the same quarter in 2012. Included in such sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the fourth quarter of 2013, in dollars, were 15.2% higher than the same period last year. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increase market share in Europe. In particular, in the U.K., Spain, Germany, Sweden, Belgium, France and South Africa, Monster increased -- achieved increase -- achieved sales gains and continued to increase its market share. Overall, our Western European and African divisions are now operating well and we have made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and sales. In anticipation of the introduction of a sales tax on energy drinks in France, on January 1, 2014, our distributor in France increased its purchases in the fourth quarter of 2013 by an estimated $3 million, which we estimate will result in a reduction in our sales to our French distributor in the first quarter of 2014 by a similar amount. We're in the process of implementing a formula change for our products sold in France to address such tax. The Central and Eastern European market is still incurring operating losses although we are seeing improved results from the strategic changes we implemented during last year. The addition of Monster Ultra Blue and Ultra Red, as well as the launch of our Muscle Monster line in 2013 were successful. We are continuing with our expansion strategy in international markets. Our distributor commenced sales in India during October 2013. In addition, we are proposing to launch Monster in a number of limited countries in Asia, Central and Eastern Europe and Africa this year. Sales of Monster Energy brand internationally, including in Japan, in particular, continue to grow satisfactorily. The weaker yen negatively affected our growth sales in U.S. dollars, as well as our margins in Japan during the quarter. Sales to our Japanese distributor in the fourth quarter were higher in dollars than in the comparable quarter last year. Plans for production in Japan and Korea continue to move forward and we are on track to commence full commercial production in Japan in March. We are also moving ahead with our plans to produce Monster Energy drinks in India. Sales in Chile are progressing well as are sales in Brazil where our new distributor continues to secure increased distribution for month-to-month. We are continuing with our strategy to secure local production in certain of our international markets, which we believe will facilitate improved gross margins and mitigate the effects of exchange rate fluctuations, as well as reduced damages. Net sales of Peace Tea in the fourth quarter and 2013 full year were higher than in the comparable periods in 2012. We continue to believe that the Peace Tea brand has good growth potential and have added a mango juice cocktail to the line. We are planning to launch an iced coffee line in glass bottles under the Peace Tea brand later in 2014. In the warehouse division, sales of Hubert's Lemonades in glass bottles for the year to December 31, 2013, were higher than sales in the previous year. The Hubert's brand continues to gain market and consumer acceptance. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales achieved in the fourth quarter of 2013 was 51.2% versus 51.7% in the comparable quarter in 2012. The decrease in gross profit percentage was primarily attributable to certain inventory damages in reserves in excess of normal levels, as well as international sales, which have lower gross profit percentages than our North American sales. The gross profit percentage achieved in the fourth quarter in North America in 2013 was higher than in the comparable quarter last year. Gross profit percentages achieved outside North America from Monster Energy were lower in the fourth quarter of 2013 than in the comparable quarter in 2012. Gross profit percentage for the 2013 full year was 52.2% compared with 51.7% in 2012. We have covered a significant portion of our anticipated requirements for aluminum cans in 2014, as well as a significant portion of our anticipated requirements for apple juice and sugar over the same period. We do not believe that at current levels, increases in the cost of any raw material will have a material negative effect on our margins. Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales in the fourth quarter was 4.5%, versus 4.7% in the comparable quarter in 2012. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.8% in the quarter versus 12.5% in the comparable period in 2012. Our sponsorships and endorsement costs were higher, as well as the cost of merchandise displays and commissions, cost of point of sales, premiums and other marketing expenses were lower during the quarter. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2013, distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales were 4.5% versus 4.4% in the prior year. Selling expenses as a percentage of sales were 11.9%, unchanged from 2012. Sponsorship and endorsement costs, merchandise display costs and allocated [indiscernible] development programs were higher than in 2012. Selling expenses were also higher due to certain marketing expenses and in-store demos. The increase in selling expenses was partially offset by reduced expenses for advertising and allocated [indiscernible] program. General and administrative expenses increased 22.2% in the quarter and 28.8% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in general and administrative cost was partially attributable to increased professional service costs for legal, accounting and other professional costs of which $4.7 million in the quarter and $17.9 million for the year, related to regulatory matters and litigation regarding our Monster Energy drinks, as well as increased payroll and related costs, which includes severance payments due to the reorganization of sales and marketing groups in Europe. Operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $3.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2013, from our international operations outside North America, which was higher than the operating losses of $0.7 million, which were incurred by us during the same period last year. We are continuing to work with certain of our distributors to increase their contribution towards promotional costs going forward and are working towards reducing our overall operating costs in our international markets. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2013, operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $12.9 million from our international operations outside North America. Following the strength of the U.S. dollar, we recorded foreign currency, transaction losses of $3.6 million for the quarter and $12.9 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2013. Our effective tax rate in the 2013 fourth quarter was 42.2% compared to 39.1% in the 2012 fourth quarter, effective tax rate for the year ended December 31 was 39.9% compared to 38.1% for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase in effective tax rate for both the 2013 fourth quarter and 2013 full year was primarily the result of the establishment of a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries, as well as losses in certain foreign subsidiaries, for which no tax benefit is recorded. During the 2013 fourth quarter, the company purchased approximately 1 million shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $56.98 per share pursuant to the repurchase program previously authorized by the Board of Directors in April 2013. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $211.3 million compared to $222.5 million at December 31, 2012. Short-term investments were $402.2 million compared to $97 million at December 31, 2012. Long-term investments decreased to $9.8 million from $21.4 million at December 31, 2012. Included in short- and long-term investments are auction rate securities of $16.2 million. Days outstanding for trade account receivables were 40.1 days at December 31, 2013 and 39.2 days at December 31, 2012, compared to 44.7 days at September 30, 2013. Inventories increased to $221.4 million from $203.1 million at December 31, 2012. Average days of inventory was 75.6 days at December 31, 2013, which was lower than the 80.3 days of inventory at December 31, 2012, and higher than the 78.7 days at September 30, 2013. Following up the positive response that we received from consumers to the launch of Zero Ultra, as well as our Ultra Blue line extension in the first half of 2013, we launched a new Ultra Red drink in the fourth quarter of 2013. In 2013, we also introduced a new line of 3 15-ounce energy shakes called Muscle Monster that contains 25 grams of protein per can, and subsequently, late in 2013 launched 2 new line extensions to the Muscle Monster line in Strawberry and Peanut Butter Cup flavors. Our additional Monster Rehab line extension, Pink Lemonade, was well-received and has become our second best-selling Rehab product in the latest 13-week ended January 25, 2014, in the convenience and gas channel. We recently launched a new Punch Monster line by converting our existing 2 Dub edition product into Punch Monster product with new can graphics and flavors. We are planning to launch new additions to the Monster family. Gross sales in January 2014 were 12.6% higher than in January 2013. We caution again that sells in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, and the timing of promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points: One, North American gross margins remain healthy. Our 2013 fourth quarter gross margins for North America were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2012; U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that the energy categories growth has recovered to the high single digits and that Monster Energy's growth is still outpacing the growth of the category as a whole; three, new additions to the Monster family that have been introduced during 2013 are positive; four, we believe our recently launched new Punch Monster line will appeal to a broader consumer demographic than Dub edition and will be positively received by distributors and consumers in 2014; five, we believe that our new Strawberry and Peanut Butter Cup Muscle Monster Energy shakes will further enhance the line and increase sales; six, turning to international markets, we are satisfied with the performance of our international expansion and investments, particularly Japan, United Kingdom, Spain, South Africa, Brazil and Chile; seven, according to Nielsen, in the 13-week period to the end of December 2013, the actual days in the 13-week period vary by 2 days between different markets. Monster's market share in value in Great Britain, Spain and South Africa as compared to the same period last year grew from 9.6% to 10.6% in Great Britain, from 17.3% to 22.3% in Spain, and from 16.8% to 21.1% in South Africa. In addition, Monster's market share in Germany and France grew from 7.1% to 8.6% in Germany, and from 15.4% to 17.4% in France; eight, I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in the EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in the EMEA vary from country to country; nine, it is noteworthy that even though the energy drink category has been in existence in Europe for over 26 years, our EMEA markets on average are still experiencing single-digit growth, while Monster continues to achieve double-digit growth; ten, sales of Monster in Japan are continuing to increase and remain encouraging; 11, [indiscernible] we were finally able to obtain regulatory approval for the sale of Monster in India. Sales are progressing satisfactorily; 12, as advised by AmBev, sales in Brazil by them are continuing to improve; 13, our initial tip productions in Japan have been favorable and we are moving forward with plans to produce in India. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets.
Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Rodney, you talked about France and the reformulation of product in France. Is that likely to have any ongoing sales impact in France, or do you see a similar tax initiated in either of the markets in Europe?
Rodney C. Sacks: We saw a similar tax initiated in Hungary and then in Mexico. And in Hungary, they put in a tax that was really high and the result was most of the energy drink companies reformulated in a different way and nobody paid the tax because it was just completely onerous and just not pragmatic. They then reformulated and they've redrawn the tax I think 3x now and they introduced tax now at a very much lower rate, which was -- which really made sense and was commercially realistic. And we reformulated and it didn't have an effect to ourselves, we have now gone back to reformulated based on the [indiscernible] tax and sales have come back. We did reformulate in Mexico and it didn't affect our sales and so, where we had the experience that we have reformulated, we've actually been able to continue. We found that the [indiscernible] labels that we were able to put in or [indiscernible] the ingredients were satisfactory. And so we believe we'll be able to reformulate and we don't believe that it will affect our sales in France. And we're just -- but obviously, we don't know exactly how it will pan out and what the government may do if they don't get the taxes they were hoping to get. So we'll see where it goes from there.
Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Great. And if I may ask one more. In the U.S., you had talked about the adoption, if everybody adopts new regulations to marketing. Now can you talk about what is your exposure to 14- to 18-year-old here? And if you adopt some voluntary marketing restrictions, what impact might have that on your sales here?
Rodney C. Sacks: Well, firstly, our primary demographic, which we've said from the -- when we first launched products in the energy category 16, 17 years ago when we launched Hansen's energy, was that our primary demographic is young adults 18 to 34. And that has since expanded a little more to 40 -- up to 45-plus. People, both above and below that age will consume our products. But that isn't our primary demographic and we don't focus our marketing efforts on people outside of that demographic. So we really don't believe that the issues of adolescents would have a [indiscernible] effect on our business. But if we look at those guidelines, the guidelines that had been proposed at this point do not affect adolescents, they are focused on marketing to children, the ADA and the FDC generally define children as under 12, many people define children as 12 and under, but that's the sort of range. So it's really focused on children and not on adolescents. And as we've said right from the beginning again, our products were not -- have not been recommended for children, we don't believe that children are consuming our products and our products are fine for adolescents and, again, but we don't believe that would be addressed by these guidelines -- be affected by the guidelines.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Wanted to quantify the gross margin impact in the quarter. So how much of the inventory damages in reserves are took down to gross margins? So what would've been on a normalized basis, that's question one. And also one while we're housekeeping, what the impact of FX was in the quarter, as well as on net international sales?
Unknown Executive: Mark, we gave the impact of FX in the statement. I'm not sure what more you're looking for on FX.
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Well, I want to know what the impact was on the top line so not just what you're talking about in terms of the impact that you quantified in the release.
Rodney C. Sacks: Well the impact to the top line is not material at all. There are some gains and there are some losses [indiscernible] . I mean, it resembles and you take individual countries that become [indiscernible] sure, it was very material in Japan but not in other countries but overall...
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Overall, that's fine.
Rodney C. Sacks: Yes.
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: What about the net international sales and the gross margin piece, please?
Rodney C. Sacks: On the gross margin, the excess, I don't have the exact -- an exact figure, but it's around about the $6 million level as we think was excess of -- in damages and -- higher than we would normally see in that area. But that's an approximate.
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Okay, great. And then, just sort of broadly thinking about international profitability selling expenses. How should we think about those numbers on a go-forward basis? The selling expense is down year-on-year on an absolute basis. You talked about putting some of the promotional activity on the distributor. So is this sort of a shift now as we look forward that maybe perhaps we start seeing some international profitability and the selling expense numbers are sort of the good ones to use on a run rate basis, the one we saw in the fourth quarter?
Rodney C. Sacks: I think that we are trying to conservatively manage our costs without clearly focusing on cost management, particularly with international, with a view to getting profitability across the board. There are many countries that are already profitable in some of the earlier countries or smaller countries that it's been harder to get enough scale of sales to offset the costs of trying to run small countries that they -- it is fragmented. But as that continues to improve, we do -- we are hopeful that by keeping the top [indiscernible] on cost, we will get -- be able to improve our profitability. We also did refer to some realignment on some of our -- we had spent -- we have pulled back on some of our sampling, our net activities, [indiscernible] ourselves, where we were sort of supplementing and helping our distributors in some countries and we probably were over -- we had too many heads, so we sort of realigned that going into the fourth quarter and we will start to see a lot -- more of those benefits coming through the 2014 year. So we are looking to obviously get to a profitability position internationally. We are optimistic but at this point, we need to see how the next couple of quarters pan out.
Unknown Executive: And of course, local production will help, local production in Japan, local production in India.
Rodney C. Sacks: Yes, And then South Africa, I think that we also are planning I think later in the year. We are opening up some additional plants in southern Europe, which will help reduce some cost. So again, that is will be one of the material impacts that we think that over the course of 2014, we will probably open up quite a few additional production sites, which will be helpful.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.
Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So in the U.S. scanner data, we clearly saw a nice rebound in retail sales in Q4, both for your business and the energy category. You seem more bullish at the January Analyst Meeting. But since then we've seen a slowdown in the February scanner data. So I was hoping for some perspective and if you think that's primarily weather-related? Or are there other factors at play that could linger longer-term? And I guess, just taking a step back and parsing through this volatility, are you comfortable that the energy drink category is on better sustainable footing now at this point versus some of the weakness we saw last year?
Rodney C. Sacks: That it's a lot more is a sort of we're not sure, I mean, that would be we'd be guessing, but I -- we think that weather has -- we never like referring to weather. One of the things we've never been weatherman in this company as opposed to some of the major soft drinks companies but we are all right of getting to a point where we are actually -- but I think it is correct. I think weather did have an effect. I think the weather has been exceptionally harsh in the East. And in many cases, it actually has affected our distributors' ability and some of our men in different -- to actually go on that we deliver and that hasn't -- it's something that we experienced over the last few years. This is something that is unusual. So we do think that weather has had some impact on the category as a whole. And we are hoping that once we get through the next month or 2, weather will start improving all over and particularly in the East and we will -- things will return to normal. We think the -- we feel quite good about the category, about the growth and that it has sort of returned to better levels. But again, depending on what happens on the regulatory front, it has been quiet and that might have an impact. But on the one hand, on the other hand, it's been going on now for over a year so I think a lot of consumers are basically starting to get tired of it and it's becoming old news. And we still feel very comfortable with the science and the safety of our products.
Operator: Our next line -- our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.
Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: If you could just kind of dig in deeper to Dara's question, the energy drink category certainly had a nice recovery over the last several months. And I'm just curious, maybe if you could correct in context on -- is this new consumers coming to the category? Is this kind of existing consumers getting back to normal consumption behavior? Any context you can provide around some of the consumption patterns would be helpful?
Rodney C. Sacks: We simply don't know. We read the results, and -- but we just don't have -- and also, I can't give you good numbers [ph] , I would be guessing. So I just can't.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Just following up on Mark's question earlier. I missed, what were the $6 million in damages, was that in Japan store or is that somewhere else? And is that expected -- anything to carry over into 2014?
Unknown Executive: We don't -- it was widespread. It was one of those interesting situations where we had widespread damages in reserves across-the-board. Some in Europe, some in the U.S., some obviously in Asia.
Rodney C. Sacks: Yes, Asia the [indiscernible] one of the problem areas and as we continue to [indiscernible] local production, we believe that will lower our cost of goods there, improve our margins and also, reduce -- eliminate the damages of concern. But it really -- it was spread all over.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay. Rodney, just thought on the kind of roll out this year, just trying to understand, I mean, are we seeing most of the new, be it Red, be it Peanut Butter Cup in the market now, or will that kind of phase-in, I mean, do you expect bigger launches as we get closer to summer?
Rodney C. Sacks: Well, Red has gone up and that's picked up quite nice distribution and that's -- in the Muscle Monster line, the actual Muscle Monster line is only about a 50% level. So we are rolling out Strawberry and that's going to pick up. We will be rolling out Peanut Butter to the general market probably in May. The new Punch line is going up as we work it through old cans and inventories, we are not sort of basically discarding any of the old inventory, so that it's starting to get onto shelves now and really by -- we expect by the end of March, early April or so, that will be pretty well distributed. There are 1 or 2 new products we are looking at. And at this point, those are sort of slated for midyear.
Unknown Executive: But we should mention that the Peanut Butter is in exclusive distribution with one particular customer group.
Rodney C. Sacks: At this point, that is correct and then the general market will go out in about May, I think it is.
Unknown Executive: That's good.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA.
Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: I'm just trying to understand on -- it's taking as long as it is to get local production going, for example, in Japan. It seems to have been pushed out a little bit over time and the damages become increasingly an issue. So what are some of the challenges you face because it's hard to imagine why it's so difficult?
Rodney C. Sacks: I'll tell you why. In Japan, we launched Monster in a slim can, the 11-ounce [indiscernible] slim can. That can was not a can manufacturer available in Japan. So we actually had to contract with a can company to have molds made and to actually have the can specifically made for us. Once we had the can made, we had to then get changed parts made on a line at which we're doing and we are testing and we're dealing with seaming issues now and production issues for really a new can that is not being run and -- on Japanese line with particular manufacturer. So this is why that has been an unusually long process. Normally, the process to get a packer up and running, you will need lesser amount of change parts maybe a share mixer or the RO water, which we require, those are 2 things that we find generally we do need to usually have our packers purchase and install. And those are usually shorter timelines, not as much complications in getting it up and running and getting quality right. So that is the reason that we've had with Japan. Then you normally have the issues of flavors and waters, the Monster Flavor, particularly the Green is very sensitive to different types of water, even though you use RO, RO has different meanings and there are different levels of minerals that are left in it. And they generally -- you'll -- you can come -- working with 1 factory works the first time and other factors, we've had a real problem with the factory in Spain where all our flavors are fine except the green. We simply can't get green with the right taste. So it's been nearly 9 months of trials and retrials in Spain to get green done. But the guys up and running with the other ones in the [indiscernible]. So we just had some production issues, the flavor is very delicate, particularly the green flavor, and that is the reason -- once we get going and we get the right authorizations in, for example, in India, that will be a shorter production issue. The issue with South Africa is similar, they don't have cans, they don't make the 500-milligram cans, it's not available. We actually are contracting to try and get cans shipped to South Africa in the short-term, and then, they will be in local production on 500, they are introducing that size towards the end of the year. So we are hoping, we actually can get production towards the second -- early in the second half of the year with the imported cans which will be slightly more expensive but then we'll go through local production. So those are the challenges we're having in addition to the normal production challenges we have. As I said, with water and mixing equipment, et cetera.
Unknown Executive: I think it's also important, Caroline, to understand that we go with the package that we feel has got the best success in our market. That's why in Japan, we went for a particular can, because we felt that would have the best success. And I think that performance to-date has proven that, that was a good move. But the can is not commercially available yet, but it will be shortly.
Rodney C. Sacks: I think one of the reasons that maybe distinguishes us from many beverage companies is that in the case of -- a usual beverage company, they will simply use the package that is easier to produce and that is locally available. And it doesn't -- they don't focus on being different and being unique and I think that is -- we do, we really do, we've done it all our lives here. And we would rather take the time and effort to get into a package that is different and that is unique than rather just follow the herd and just take a normal -- we could use a normal 12-ounce package like a soda can and do it, but we think that is the reason why we've been able to make Monster different and that was one of the reasons. And it is important to stay true to that, so it has taken more time. We understand that. But it will come together, it's just it has taken more time than we would have liked them.
Operator: And our final question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.
John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Wanted just follow up on one of the things you mentioned in the call, which was severance payments in Europe, related to your restructuring. Is that related to some of the changes in the contracts you're trying to work out with the distributors?
Rodney C. Sacks: No, that is completely separate. This was just in anticipation of possibly, sort of maybe being more optimistic about where the category was going in sales. I think, we ramped up with there and just found that we had our MET teams and TDMs were probably too large. We looked at our margins and the available margins and this really had to trim down and get that down to a more manageable level and to grow a little slower. So we looked -- that was the restructuring and that was pretty much and by and large in Western Europe. This is during the last -- the fourth quarter.
John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, great. And then one other sort of quick follow-up on India. At the Analyst Meeting, you talked about moving into India maybe a little bit sooner than you had planned because the right distributor came up. I guess, how should we think about the run rate there, is this a market where you think it -- we should -- we need to be patient and it's going to take a long time to develop?
Rodney C. Sacks: We think you need to be patient. We think ultimately, the market is a very big market but as the moment, the Ultra Premium energy drink market is a small niche market from an affordability point of view. But we think that will continue to grow just as the country starts to expand and grow. So we see the energy category being a much bigger market down the line. I mean, it's obviously you know that population is up. But in the short term, it will be a smaller niche market and we are hoping to grow as we did in Japan was to hope to actually grow the market as opposed to simply trying to get a share of the existing market, but a lot of logistical issues in Japan in getting product from -- through the different cities where we sort of primarily focused our launch on a couple of key cities, the 2 main cities, obviously of Delhi and Mumbai, and a couple of the other major ones sort of -- as well. But those -- that's been the focus and as we continue to grow, we will be able to roll it out more.
Unknown Executive: And as we have mentioned and spoken to our analysts in the past, we'll continue to lose money in India until we are able to achieve local production.
Rodney C. Sacks: In some ways it's good enough to sell too much because -- well there's more per can. But we are going to get there and we hopefully will get to local production or so reasonably, reasonably soon, going forward.
Operator: I'm showing no further questions at this time and I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Rodney Sacks for any further remarks.
Rodney C. Sacks: Thank you very much. On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. We are reiterating, and I can do it enough in times, that our products are safe, are properly labeled and the caffeine content of a Monster at approximately 10 milligrams per ounce is less than 0.5 milligrams per ounce of the caffeine levels contained in Starbucks and other coffee house, brewed coffee. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2013 Q3  (2013-11-07 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Member of Executive Committee and Chairman of Hansen Beverage Company

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Corporation's Third Quarter 2013 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Mr. Sacks, please begin.
Rodney C. Sacks: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today; as is as Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company, that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed March 1, 2013, as well as our most recent report on Form 10-Q filed August 9, 2013, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements, for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated November 7, 2013. A copy of this information is also available on our website, www.monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. Although I do not wish to appear redundant every time that I open our quarterly conference calls, I do however, want to reiterate once again that our products are safe, based on both our and the industry's long track record and the scientific evidence supporting the safety of our ingredients. As investigations of energy drinks continue and further research on these topics and issues is undertaken, the results consistently confirm and reinforce our repeated views that our products are safe. Additionally, we believe that the strongest evidence of product safety is that many millions of energy drinks continue to be safely consumed worldwide every day. By now, nearly 10 billion Monster Energy drinks have been sold and safely consumed around the world over the past 11 years. As previously announced, the Food and Drug Administration is investigating the safety of caffeine in food products and particularly its effect, if any, on children and adolescents. An independent review panel was convened by the FDA through the Institute of Medicine to help determine if there are potential health hazards associated with the consumption of caffeine in food and dietary supplements. This panel held a public workshop during August 2013 in Washington, D.C. We're still awaiting the report of this panel. The long history of safe use of products containing caffeine in the U.S. has the remained unchanged and studies indicate that the average amount of caffeine consumed by the U.S. population has remained relatively stable, despite the entry of energy drinks into the market. As previously indicated and as stated by the FDA in 2012, available studies do not indicate any new previously unknown risks associated with caffeine consumption, although the FDA has continued to explore whether additional research on caffeine or energy drinks is needed. Many studies conducted in recent years in the U.S.A., Canada and Europe, including a very recent study, have all consistently concluded that the principal sources of caffeine for teens under 18 are coffee, soft drinks and tea and not energy drinks. To put of the level of caffeine that is contained in Monster Energy drinks in context, we remind listeners that a Starbucks 16-ounce-sized brewed coffee contains approximately 330 milligrams of caffeine, which is more than double the approximately 160 milligrams of caffeine that is contained in the same-sized Monster Energy drink. I will now briefly provide listeners with an update on certain of the current regulatory matters and litigation. For a more extensive discussion on regulatory matters and litigation, listeners are referred to our 10-Q, which will be filed in the next few days. The company continues to diligently monitor developments relating to these issues. The complaint filed by the City Attorney of San Francisco against the company was remanded to the San Francisco Superior Court. Subsequently the City Attorney filed a renewed motion to dismiss the complaint filed by the company against the City Attorney, for declaratory and injunctive relief, in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. A hearing on that motion is scheduled for December 9, 2013. In a purported class action filed against the company, alleging issues relating to Monster Energy drinks' safety and the marketing activities of the company, an amended complaint was filed against the company after the original complaint was dismissed by the court. The company moved to dismiss the amended complaint. At the hearing the court issued a tentative ruling dismissing the amended complaint. The company's currently awaiting the final judgment of the court on that motion. Following the hearing held by the U.S. Senate Commerce -- Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation on July 31, 2013, on September 25, 2013, 4 United States senators, 3 of whom are members of the committee, addressed a letter to the company and some 16 other energy drink companies. In that letter, these 4 senators asked whether the energy drink companies would be prepared to agree to a number of commitments relating primarily to the manner in which their energy drinks are marketed. On October 28, 2013, the company responded to the senators' letter indicating numerous commitments it would be willing to make under certain circumstances. In addition, the company has forwarded to the 4 senators and to the American Beverage Association, a set of proposed U.S. model guidelines for energy drink companies. The company is hopeful that under the auspices of the ABA, all major energy drink companies will adopt these guidelines with regard to their U.S. activities. The company supports the proposed model guidelines and would agree to adopt them if all other major energy drink companies doing business in the U.S. also adopt them. In that fashion, the company believes that the concerns expressed by the senators and others would be addressed without putting the company at any material competitive disadvantage. The company assumes no obligation to update any statements made with respect to ongoing litigation and regulatory matters, including with respect to the foregoing disclosures, whether as to new information, future events or otherwise, other than as required by law. Given the current litigation and the pending regulatory requests, we will refrain from answering questions or commenting further on these specific subjects. We are happy, of course, to answer questions that you may have about our products in general or about the third quarter results as best we can, after we have concluded our discussion on the business. Turning to the business. While the beverage market in general in North America continues to experience softness, more specifically in CSDs, the energy drink market continues to grow, although the rate of growth still remains in single digits. However undoubtedly [ph] from the field, the energy drink market appears to be gaining momentum. Sales of our new Monster Ultra Blue energy drinks, as well as our new Muscle Monster line and our tea plus pink lemonade and energy Monster Rehab line extension, have exceeded our expectations and we are optimistic that we will be able to achieve increased sales contributions from these products in the future. In fact, Ultra Blue quickly became one of the top 5 selling Monster SKUs in the convenience and gas channel, according to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through September 28, 2013. Additionally, according to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through September 28, 2013, in the convenience and gas channel, Muscle Monster has become the second best-selling brand in the protein supplement sector and achieved a 20% market share. Even though ACB distribution levels are still low. We are optimistic that as we continue to achieve increased distribution levels for our Muscle Monster line, we will be able to increase our market share of the protein supplement sector. During the third quarter, our operating income was negatively affected by increased professional services costs of $6.5 million, net of insurance reimbursements, of which $5.3 million related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the company's marketing, promotions, ingredients, labeling and safety of its Monster Energy drinks, which we believe are exceptional in nature. The net effect on earnings per share professional services costs relates to regulatory matters and related litigation is approximately $0.02 per share. The company continued to make progress in the third quarter and achieved record third quarter gross sales, up 8.6% from the third quarter of 2012, to $686.6 million with net sales up 8.9% to $590.4 million. Operating income was up 7.6% to $151.4 million. Our tax rate was marginally lower this quarter at 38.8% from 39% in the same quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share increased 13.1% from $0.47 per share in the third quarter of 2012 to $0.53 per share in the third quarter of 2013. Although we are pleased with the results, our revenues were affected by: one, less robust growth sales for the energy category as a whole, in our principal market, the United States; two, less robust growth of the energy category overall in Europe, despite the slower growth Monster was still able to achieve 8.6% growth in dollars in that region in the third quarter, well ahead of the growth of the category overall in that region; three, sales of our new Zero Ultra and Ultra Blue energy drinks, although accretive, did result in some cannibalization generally across our existing SKUs; four, sales were positively affected by the launch of our new Ultra Blue energy drink as well as sales of our new Muscle Monster line, sales of Monster Energy products in glass bottles and the Extra Strength line were lower, as were sales of Worx energy shots; five, sales in our DSD division in North America were 10.6% higher in the third quarter and contribution margin from the DSD division during that period was up 14.2% over the comparable period last year. Sales in our warehouse division were lower as a result, primarily, of an unsuccessful promotion with a large retailer, including an extensive sampling and in-store demo program. The warehouse division incurred an operating loss of $2.2 million as compared to a small operating profit that was earned by the division in the same period last year. As discussed on previous conference calls, we will be reporting on Nielsen's extended sample of outlets, which includes Wal-Mart; dollar stores, such as Family Dollar, Dollar General, and Fred's; DeCA military stores; and club stores, namely Sam's and BJ's but excluding Costco. According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through September 28, 2013, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, on the expanded basis I just described, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including Shots, increased by 3.1% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 9.3% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 7.4%. Sales of Rockstar decreased by 5%, and sales of 5-Hour decreased by 9.7%. Sales of AMP were down 16%. NOS increased sales by 17.1%, and sales of Full Throttle decreased 2.2%. According to the Nielsen reports for the 5 weeks ended September 28, 2013, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel, in dollars, increased by 5.2% over the comparable period in 2012. Sales of Monster increased by 10.2% over the comparable period last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 8.8% over the same period. Rockstar was up 3.5%, while 5-Hour was down 5.4% and AMP was down 15.1%. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended September 28 -- I think, sorry, it's 5 weeks September 28, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased by 1.5 points over the comparable period a year ago to 34.3%, ahead of Red Bull's share of 34.2%, Rockstar's share of 8.1%, 5-Hour's share of 9.9% and AMP's share of 2.7%. According to Nielsen, in the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2013, sales of energy plus coffee drinks, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel increased 6.1% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 11.1% higher than in the comparable period last year, while Starbucks Double Shot energy was 1.3% higher. Sales of Java Monster continue to exceed sales of Starbucks Double Shot energy drinks in dollars. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended September 21, 2013, the energy drink category grew 5%. Monster sales increased 17%. Our market share increased 3 points to 29% over the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales increased 2% and its market share decreased 1.3 points to 38.3%. Rockstar sales increased 6% and its market share increased by 0.3 points to 13.7%. According to Nielsen for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 1.4% in the month of September 2013. Monster sales decreased 11.3% and our market share decreased 4.8 points to 33.7% over the comparable period last year. But still ahead of Red Bull's market share. Red Bull sales decreased 1.5% and its market share decreased by 0.9% to 32%. Boost's sales increased 20.4%, and its market share increased 2.5 points to 15.5%. Gladiator sales decreased 21.3%, and its market share decreased by 2.3 points to 7.9%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months at a time, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. By way of illustration, according to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 15.5% in the month of August 2013. Monster sales increased 27.1% and our market share increased 3.6 points to 39.4% over the comparable period last year, while Red Bull sales decreased 1.9% and its market share decreased by 5.5 points to 30.7%. This should be contrasted with the Nielsen results I've just reported above for the month of September in Mexico. Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 9.8% to $566.8 million for the 3 months ended September 30, 2013, from $516.3 million in the same period in 2012 and contribution margin increased 14.6% to $194.9 million from $170.1 million in the same period in 2012. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment decreased 7.9% to $23.7 million for the 3 months ended September 30, 2013, compared with $25.7 million for the same period in 2012, and contribution margin decreased to a contribution loss of $2.2 million this quarter from a contribution margin of $0.04 million in the same quarter last year. Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the third quarter of 2013 amounted to $151.6 million compared to $144.7 million in the same quarter in 2012. Included in such sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the third quarter, in dollars, were 8.6% higher than in the same period last year. Monster continues to gain momentum in that region and is growing in excess of the growth in the category. In particular, in each of the U.K., Spain, Germany and South Africa, which are our largest markets in that region, Monster achieved further market share gains. According to Nielsen report, and for some markets Information Resources Inc., reports for the 13 weeks to the end of August 2013 -- and this is what I want to point out that the actual dates of the 4-week periods vary by a few days between different markets as reported to us. Monster's market share in value in its European markets and South Africa increased from 8.6% to 10%. We are continuing with our expansion strategy in international markets. We launched Monster Energy in Croatia during the quarter. Although we had hoped to be able to commence sales in India during the quarter, we only received the required regulatory approvals for India, subsequent to the quarter end. Sales of Monster Energy drinks commenced in India during October. We are planning to launch Monster in a few different countries in Asia, Central and Eastern Europe and Africa later this year and early next year. Sales of the Monster Energy brand internationally, including in Japan, in particular, continue to grow satisfactorily. The weaker yen continued to negatively affect our gross sales in U.S. dollars, as well as our margins in Japan during the quarter. While sales to our Japanese distributor in the third quarter of 2013 were lower in dollars than in the comparable quarter last year, we have been advised that case sales, as well as sales out, from our Japanese distributed to retailers were higher in the quarter than in the comparable period last year. Plans for production in Japan and Korea are proceeding satisfactorily. Test production runs have now taken place in both Korea and Japan. And we are on track to commence full commercial production in Japan within the next few months. We also are moving ahead with our plans to produce Monster Energy drinks in India. Sales in Chile are progressing well. In Brazil, our new distributor, Ambev, continued to secure increased distribution levels from month-to-month. Indeed, sales by Ambev to its customers also continued to improve from month-to-month and we are advised that record sales were achieved by Ambev during October. We caution that sales in the single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors. Such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, and the timing of promotions in retail stores, as well as changes in production schedules and deliveries, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the quarter or any future period. According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through September 28, 2013, in the convenience and gas channel, sales of Peace Tea were 5% lower than in the same period last year. Sales in the category were also lower by 1.7%. We continue to believe that Peace Tea brand has good growth potential and are planning to add a juice cocktail to the line, and we are evaluating the launch of ice coffees in glass bottles under the Peace Tea brand as well. In the warehouse division, sales of Hubert's Lemonades in glass bottles for the 9 months through September 30, 2013, are significantly above sales in the previous comparable 9-month period. The Hubert's brand continues to gain market and consumer acceptance. Gross profit margins achieved in the third quarter of 2013 were 52.1% versus 50.5% in the comparable quarter in 2012. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially attributable to changes in product sales mix, particularly the higher percentage of sales represented by our Ultra line and the Rehab Pink Lemonade line, which have a higher gross margins than most of our other 16-ounce products due to lower costs of goods, as well as a reduction in certain import costs and compensation for past product damages in respect to shipments to Asia. Gross margins achieved in the quarter in North America in 2013 were higher than in the comparable quarter last year. Gross margins achieved for international sales of Monster Energy, excluding those products sold from the United States, were also higher in the third quarter of 2013 than in the comparable quarter of 2012. We have covered a significant portion of our anticipated requirements for aluminum cans in 2013, and a large part of 2014, as well as a significant portion of our anticipated requirements for apple juice and sugar over the same period. We do not believe that at current levels, increases in costs of any raw materials will have a material negative effect on our margins. Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales in the third quarter were 4.6% versus 4.4% in the comparable quarter in 2012 due primarily to increased freight and warehouse expenses in Europe and South Africa. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12% versus 11.6% in the comparable period in 2012. Sponsorships and endorsement costs were higher as well as the cost of merchandise displays. Cost of premiums were lower during the quarter. Cost of trade development programs to supplement our distribution partner sales were also marginally higher during the quarter. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased professional services costs for legal, accounting and other professional costs and which I commented on, earlier on this call. Operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $5.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2013, from our operations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, South America and Asia, which was higher than the operating losses of $2.5 million, which were incurred last year in the same period last year, primarily due to a non routine indirect tax-related provision. On a trading basis, the operating losses this quarter were comparable with the operating losses incurred during the same quarter last year. Operating income for the DSD division was $194.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, which was higher than operating income of $117.1 million, which was earned by the DSD division during the same period last year. Operating losses incurred in the warehouse division amounted to $2.2 million as compared to an operating profit of $0.04 million in the same quarter last year. Our effective tax rate in the 2013 third quarter was 38.8% compared to 39% in the 2012 third quarter. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $287 million compared to $222.5 million at December 31, 2012. Short-term investments were $315.6 million compared to $97 million at December 31, 2012. Long-term investments comprised entirely of auction rate securities decreased from $21 million at December 31, 2012, to $9.7 million at September 30, 2013. Accounts receivables increased to $339.2 million from $236 million at December 31, 2012. Days outstanding for receivables consistent with the above treatment were 44.7 days at September 30, 2013, and 41.3 days at September 30, 2012, compared to 42.8 days at June 30, 2013. Days outstanding for receivables are expected to increase due to the different terms generally granted to customers internationally in accordance with local practices in their respective countries. Inventories increased to $247.4 million from $203.1 million at December 31, 2012. Average days of inventory was 78.7 days at September 30, 2013, which was higher than the 65 days of inventory at September 30, 2012, and higher than the 71.3 days at June 30, 2013. Gross sales in October 2013 were approximately 9.3% higher than in October 2012. We caution again that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. To date, no shares have been purchased under our April 2013 repurchase plan. I'd like to turn to our recent announcement concerning Mark Hall. Mark has been involved in the beverage industry for more than a quarter of a century and has been with the company since 1997 as President of the Monster division. Mark has been an important part of the company but expressed a desire to become less involved in the day-to-day activities and also wished to take some time off for personal reasons until the end of the year. Mark has built a good team around him and has been focusing more on the positioning of the Monster Energy and Peace Tea brands, innovation and product development and spent less time on day-to-day management. Mark's new role as Chief Brand Officer for Monster Energy as of January 2014, formalizes his current role and is a win-win situation for both Mark and the company. Mark will continue to be responsible for the positioning of the Monster Energy and Peace Tea brands, innovation and product development. Mark will also serve on the Board of Directors of the company. In October, the company launched a new Monster Ultra Red line extension, and is in the process of launching a new strawberry Muscle Monster energy shake. The company's planning to launch a further line extension of its Muscle Monster line at the beginning of 2014. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. One, North American gross margins remain healthy. Our 2013 third quarter gross margins for North America were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2012. U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that Monster Energy's growth is still outpacing the growth of the category as a whole on an increasing basis, particularly over the last 4 weeks. Ultra Red, which was launched recently and strawberry Muscle Monster, which is in the process of being launched are both receiving good reception from both retailers, as well as from consumers. Turning to international markets, we are satisfied with the performance of our international expansion and investments, particularly in the United Kingdom, Spain, Germany, South Africa, Japan, Brazil and Chile. According to Nielsen, and/or for some markets IRI, the 4-week period -- for the 4-week period ending at the end of August 2013 -- again the actual dates, I pointed out, for the 4-week period vary by a few days between different markets. Monster's market share in value in Great Britain, Spain and France as compared to the same period last year grew from 9.2% to 10.4% in Great Britain from 15.2% to 20.7% in Spain and from 18% to 21.3% in South Africa. In addition, Monster's market shares in Germany and France grew from 7.4% to 8.6% in Germany and from 14.9% to 17.1% in France. In the 4 weeks to the end of September 2013, Monster's market share in Great Britain increased further to 11.4%. In Spain, increased further to 24.9% and in South Africa, increased further to 23.5%. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in Europe should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in Europe vary from country to country. Sales of Monster in Japan are continuing to increase and remain encouraging. According to our distributor in Japan, Monster has now achieved a 31% market share of the energy drink market in Japan. Seven, we are excited as we have finally managed to obtain a regulatory approval for the sale of Monster in India. We view India as an exciting future growth opportunity for Monster, particularly over the long term. Eight, as advised by Ambev, sales out by them to retailers in October reached the highest level since they commenced distribution of the Monster brand in Brazil at the beginning of this year. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: So international, just want to try to understand a little bit more sort of puts and takes there. Maybe you talked a bit about Japan could give us a sense of what the FX impact was there. Maybe talk about some of the sell-in in India how much potentially that impacted it in the October number? And just sort of, give some thoughts in general about sort of how you see it, especially as you look at the number in the quarter and you had a pretty material acceleration on a 2-year basis. So long question but should we think about this as a new run rate, is there a timing issue, I mean inventories, anything you can give that may give us a little bit more color on the international would be helpful.
Rodney C. Sacks: With regard to India, let me just start there. When we started sales, we had originally shipped product to India well before I think it was either the end of last year or the first quarter of this year. And we had shipped that in anticipation of getting regulatory approval and then we ended up with some delays in getting that approval. So it wasn't a buildup of inventory in this quarter for India. With regard to Japan, what we have seen was some reduction in inventory levels being held by our distributor during the quarter. And I think as they are getting more comfortable with the brand and the sector, which is something they really didn't have any experience with, their stock holdings are going low and that is why we refer to the fact that while our sales were low, actually their sales out were higher in Japan. A similar situation has sort of arisen with respect to Brazil in the quarter. On a ForEx level, I will try and get you the impact later on in the call. I don't have it handy. Is there anything else you'd like to ask, Mark?
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Sure, how about that share repurchase, anything coming down the pike there with all the cash that is now building?
Rodney C. Sacks: We look at market conditions as they develop and look to implementing the share repurchase as we go forward. We will raise it again with the board at a meeting tomorrow and then we'll see how we go through the end of the year.
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay, and then just related to the first question. Can you quantify the amount of de-stocking in Japan and Brazil as you're looking for the FX piece?
Rodney C. Sacks: I -- do you have the -- I really at this stage, at this time, I just don't have that figure -- those figures handy. Other than to say that, our sales into our distributors in both those areas were considerably lower than the sales out.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma with BMO Capital.
Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Can you just, Ron, you talked about the ABA guidelines and the senators letter. Is it fair to assume that if you do adhere for these guidelines and this overall energy drinks category, agree to these guidelines, some of the regulatory headwinds that you've seen as indicative [indiscernible] will ease up?
Rodney C. Sacks: Well, we can't speculate as to whether what we have suggested would be completely satisfactory to senators or regulators. We've just, from our assessment of the questions that we've got and the request for commitment that we have from the senators, we believe this goes a pretty far way to dealing with them. There are some issues that we have still and don't believe we should agree to and won't voluntarily to agree to. And they may remain still contentious, outstanding contentious issues. But we do believe that pretty much by and large, we think that this will resolve, or certainly alleviate to a large measure, some of those headwinds.
Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: The other question was around profitability. You talked about some onetime sort of losses in the warehouse. Are those -- should that be considered onetime that will alleviate in the next quarter? Or you continue to expect a negative margin piece in the warehouse division?
Rodney C. Sacks: No, we think that, that won't repeat itself. We think that, that will right itself next quarter.
Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. And my final question is, as we look at your market share position in [indiscernible] in Europe, especially Western Europe and countries, should we start to sort of assume that margin profile in these countries could start to get better and, perhaps, positive margins in these market?
Rodney C. Sacks: You are very unclear. But if -- what you're talking about is our margins in Europe, we are taking steps to improve our margin through production in a number of additional countries in Europe. For technical reasons some of the production that we had planned to implement during the year, we weren't comfortable with the quality of the products running off -- coming off the lines and so we weren't able to implement some of those, those plans. But we are planning to produce at additional production plants in Southern Europe, which will alleviate a lot of the freight and damages cost and other cost in health margins. We are also planning -- we are quite advanced in production and planning production in South Africa, which will remove the freight from Europe to South Africa and also, reduce damages in transit and also improve our margins there as well. This also will apply in Japan where we are progressing as quickly as we can to implement production. And we also are [indiscernible] finally, we are also at an advanced stage of discussions and moving forward with production plans for additional production plants in Brazil, which we believe will also, because of they are complicated tax laws, will also help us achieve improved margins in Brazil. So we are hoping that in 2014, we will actually start to see some improved margins coming.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell from SunTrust.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Just on the Monster Muscle, can you maybe quantify I think you'd said ACB is pretty low. Where we stand there? And where next few months or few quarters?
Rodney C. Sacks: The ACB level that Nielsen has indicated for Muscle Monster is about 38% ACB.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: And can that get to 50%, 60%, 70%?
Rodney C. Sacks: Well, it should get to 80%, 80-plus like most of our other energy drink brands. And then obviously, what you might get in -- within the range, you might get a variation of ACB levels from the bestsellers to the least. We have 3, we're introducing strawberry Muscle Monster and we are planning to introduce another variant at the beginning of 2014. So we believe that we will be able to certainly get our better selling products in that -- in the range up to that 80-plus level. But it's a question of time and when we get listings and get into the new sets in spring.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay, and then is this something that's planned to take international?
Rodney C. Sacks: Sorry at this point, we're just looking at the U.S. market. We're also evaluating the Canadian market. But due to cost of goods at this time, we aren't looking at any of the other markets yet.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Got it. Sorry, last -- only one question. In Europe, just trying to make sure I understood like CCE on a call a few weeks ago said Monster sales were up around 25%, and then I think you said Europe for you was up 8% to 9%. Is that just weakness in non-CCE channels or is there some disconnect I'm missing?
Rodney C. Sacks: We take it across all countries. And as we indicated, I gave you some of our bigger countries. Basically, we have increased rates, but a lot of the central and eastern countries have been -- their actual category is down and we haven't seen those sort of increases. And so when you balance it across the whole of Europe, it's come down more but also I think there is some issue in CCE. They did, we think, reduce inventories. But I don't have a figure for that. There was some reduction in their inventory holdings, which again also translate into a difference between our sell in and their sell out. And I think there was a production, they delayed production at the end of the quarter. Just because in some of -- in many of their markets, they run production and then charge out the products and then record a sell, once they run the product produced, and then it gets delivered and they moved their production that was scheduled at the end of September, they moved that into the beginning of October. So that, I think it may have had some impact as well.
Operator: And our last question will come from the line of Alton Stump with Northcoast Research.
Alton K. Stump - Northcoast Research: Just wanted to ask -- just to clarify from a question about India. In the October sales number of up, what was it, 9.1, was there any impact in that just a current month or the October month from India?
Rodney C. Sacks: No. Once again, because we really just started getting regulatory approval, they were using some of their current inventory they had on hand and we're now starting to produce new fresh inventory for them. So India really had no effect. Just want to go back -- in Japan the foreign exchange difference is about $2 million. Also just wanted to mention that, just in case you guys have looked at the some of the inventory buildup, that's possibly due to the fact that we started delivering some of the Ultra Red during the quarter. Although we launched it in the October, there was some sales in the quarter of Ultra Red, we were building up inventory. Also, we had Ultra Blue inventory, which is from the launch in March, which we didn't have last year. And we also have a Call of Duty promotion, both in the U.S. and in many of our international markets, and so there was some buildup of inventory in anticipation of deliveries for that promotion, which will take place later in the quarter, it will take place starting now, I think and going through to the end of the year.
Alton K. Stump - Northcoast Research: Okay, if I could, one quick follow-up, Rodney or no?
Rodney C. Sacks: Want to have a follow-up?
Alton K. Stump - Northcoast Research: Yes. I'd like to ask a follow-up if I could. Just, as you look at the category, it'll only be up low-single digits in the third quarter I guess the comps were easier, is there still any impact, do you think, just from the perception of all the headline news risks? I think you've mentioned that on the last couple of conference calls, is that still out there, is it still and impact in the category do you think?
Rodney C. Sacks: We think that there's still some impact, but we think that it is being -- it is lessening as time goes on because things are -- this started over year ago. The amount of articles and comments and has become sort of lessened. So we do believe there has been lesser of an impact and eventually, we believe it will get -- it eventually will be eliminated and go away. But at the moment, we think there is still some there on the category, generally. All right. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued support for the company. We remain confident in the safety of our products and our growth strategy, both domestically and internationally. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Corporation Second Quarter 2013 Finance Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead, sir.
Rodney C. Sacks: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that to these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed March 1, 2013, as well as our most recent report on Form 10-Q filed May 10, 2013, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements, for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated August 8, 2013. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. Once again, we reiterate that our products are safe based on both our and the industry's long track record and the scientific evidence supporting the safety of our ingredients. We estimate that about 50 billion cans of energy drinks have been sold and safely consumed worldwide over the past 25 years, including more than 9 billion Monster Energy drinks over the past 11 years. In 2012, we sold some 2 billion cans of Monster Energy drinks in approximately 90 countries. Put another way, more than 5 million cans of Monster Energy drinks are sold and safely consumed around the world everyday. In May, the Food and Drug Administration announced that in response to a trend in which caffeine is being added to a number of products, the agency would investigate the safety of caffeine in food products, particularly its effect on children and adolescents. The FDA convened a third-party review panel through the Institute of Medicine to help determine potential health hazards associated with consumption of caffeine in food and dietary supplements. The panel held hearings on Monday and Tuesday earlier this week in Washington D.C. The FDA previously stated that there is a long history of safe use of products containing caffeine in the U.S., and that the average amount of caffeine consumed by the U.S. population has not increased in spite of the entry of energy drinks into the marketplace. The FDA has also stated that available studies do not indicate any new previously unknown risks associated with caffeine consumption, though the agency continues to explore whether additional research on caffeine or energy drinks is needed. Unfortunately, inaccurate, speculative and biased articles continue to be published regarding energy drinks and, in particular, the caffeine levels therein. The simplest and most effective way of addressing these comments is to compare the caffeine levels in Monster Energy drinks from all sources to the caffeine levels in coffeehouse coffee such as, for example, Starbucks or Caribou, as this comparison is easily understood by and is meaningful to consumers. Coffee has been and continues to be extensively and safely consumed everyday in the U.S. by many tens of millions of consumers, many of whom are teenagers. In making such comparison, we believe it is appropriate to use Starbucks' 16-ounce medium-sized brewed coffee, which is the same size as a regular 16-ounce Monster Energy drink. A Starbucks 16-ounce brewed coffee contains approximately 330 milligrams of caffeine, which is more than double the approximate 160 milligrams of caffeine in the same sized Monster Energy drink. A 16-ounce Caribou brewed coffee contains between 305 milligrams and 370 milligrams of caffeine. Studies conducted in recent years confirm that the principal sources of caffeine for teens under 18 are coffee, soft drinks and tea, not energy drinks. With regards to the complaint filed by the company against the City Attorney of San Francisco and the Federal District Court in Riverside, the City Attorney has filed an application to dismiss the complaint, which the company has opposed. We expect that this application will be argued in the near future. With regard to the complaint filed by the City Attorney of San Francisco against the company in State Court in San Francisco, the company removed the case to Federal District Court in Northern California. The City Attorney has applied to remand the case back to the State Court. The company has filed its opposition to the application and is awaiting the city's reply. We expect that this application will also be argued in the near future. An purported class action complaint filed against the company regarding the labeling and/or safety of its energy drink products was dismissed, with leads to the plaintiffs to refile on limited grounds. The plaintiffs have now filed an amended complaint, which the company believes to be without merit. The company intends to vigorously defend against that claim and intends again to move for dismissal of the complaint. On July 31, 2013, the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation held a hearing entitled Energy Drinks: Exploring Concerns About Marketing To Youth, at which the company testifies, together with representatives from 2 other energy drink companies, Red Bull and Rockstar, and certain additional witnesses. The company assumes no obligation to update any statements made with respect to ongoing litigation and regulatory matters, including with respect to the foregoing disclosures, whether as to new information, future events or otherwise, other than as required by law. Given the current litigation and pending regulatory requests, we will refrain from answering questions or commenting further on these specific subjects. We are happy, of course, to answer questions that you may have about our products in general or about the second quarter results as best we can after we have concluded our discussion on the business. Turning to the business. In the second quarter of 2013, the beverage market in general continued to experience softness. In particular, the 2 major soft drink companies in the U.S., in connection with their respective quarterly reports, reported lower CSD volumes in the U.S. in the second quarter of 2013 than in the same quarter of 2012. The reduction in the growth rate of the energy drink market in the U.S. that I alluded to in my previous conference call on May 8, 2013, continued through the second quarter of 2013, we believe, in part, due to the ongoing negative publicity that continues to question the safety of energy drinks and/or their ingredients and/or suggests limitations on their ingredients, including caffeine and/or the levels thereof and/or minimum age restrictions for consumers. The growth in energy drink market also continued to slow during the second quarter in certain international markets, particularly Europe. The successful launch of Monster Zero Ultra in the third quarter of 2012, while contributing to the increase in sales of the company, resulted in some cannibalization generally across existing SKUs. According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through June 29, 2013, in the convenience and gas channel, Zero Ultra has become our second best-selling SKU after our Original Monster Green. During the second quarter, our operating income was negatively affected by distributed termination costs of approximately $2 million. Such costs were expensed in full in the quarter. The amounts that will be received from our new distributors for those areas will be approximately equal to such termination costs inclusive of the costs that were incurred in the first quarter. However, all such amounts are required to be accounted for as deferred revenue and may only be recognized as revenue ratably over the anticipated life of the respective distribution agreements, which is generally 20 years. On a cash flow basis, however, those transactions will be neutral to the company. During the quarter, we incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $3.6 million primarily related operations in Australia, Japan and South Africa. Additionally, during the quarter, we incurred increased professional service costs of $5 million, net of insurance reimbursements, of which $4.2 million related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the company's marketing promotions, ingredients, labeling and safety of Monster Energy Drinks, which we believe are extraordinary in nature. The net effect of distributed termination payments, foreign exchange losses and professional service costs related to regulatory matters and related to litigation on the operating income of the company amounts to approximately $9.8 million. The company continued to make progress in the second quarter and achieved record second quarter gross sales, up 6.6% from the second quarter of 2012 to $723.9 million, with net sales up 6.5% to $630.9 million. Operating income was up 5.7% to $179.4 million, and our tax rate was higher this quarter at 39.3% from 35.3% in the same quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share increased 4.6% from $0.59 per share in the second quarter of 2012 to $0.62 per share in the second quarter of 2013. Although we are pleased with the results, our revenues were affected by less robust growth rates for the energy category as a whole and Monster Energy, in particular, in our principal market, the United States, as well as in Canada and Mexico in the second quarter; less robust growth of the energy category overall in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Despite the slower growth, Monster was still able to achieved 13% growth in dollars in that region in the second quarter, well ahead of the growth of the category overall in that region. Sales of our new Monster Zero Ultra, although accretive, did result in some cannibalization generally across our existing SKUs. Sales were positively affected by the launch of our new Ultra Blue energy drink in March 2013. Sales of Monster products in glass bottles and the extra strength line were lower, as were sales of Worx energy shots; sales in our Warehouse division, which were higher principally due to increased sales of Hubert's Lemonades. As discussed in our previous conference calls, we will be reporting on Nielsen's extended sample of outlets, which includes Wal-Mart; dollar stores, such as Family Dollar, Dollar General and Fred's; DeCA military stores; and club stores, namely Sam's and BJ's but excluding Costco. According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through July 27, 2013, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, on the expanded basis I just described, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including Shots, increased by 2.7% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 10.1% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 6.7%. Sales of Rockstar decreased by 7.2%, and sales of 5-Hour decreased by 11.6%. Sales of AMP were down 15.4%. NOS increased sales by 16.5%, and sales of Full Throttle were down 2.9%. According to the Nielsen report for the 4 weeks ended July 27, 2013, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel, in dollars, increased by 6.1% over the comparable 4-week period in 2012. Sales of Monster increased by 16.4% over the comparable period last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 8.7% over the same period. Rockstar was down 7.9%, while 5-Hour was down 8.9%. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 27, 2013, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 3.1 points over the comparable period a year ago to 34% against Red Bull's share of 35.4%, Rockstar's share of 7.7%, 5-Hour's share of 9.8% and AMP's of 2.6%. According to Nielsen, in the 13 weeks ended July 27, 2013, sales of energy plus coffee drinks, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel increased 5.8% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 15.6% higher than in the comparable period last year, while Starbucks Double Shot energy was down 1.9%. Sales of Java Monster continue to exceed sales of Starbucks Double Shot energy drinks in dollars. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channels in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended June 29, 2013, the energy drink category grew 3%. Monster sales increased 1%. Our market share is 24.4%, which is 0.5 of a point lower than in the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales increased 7% and its market share increased 1.3 points to 37.9%. Rockstar sales increased 10% and its market share increased 1.1 points to 17.1%. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 4 weeks ended June 29, 2013, sales of energy drinks grew 3%. Over this period, sales of Red Bull decreased 1% and sales of Monster increased 5%, while sales of Rockstar increased 25%. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 5.5% in the month of June 2013. Monster sales increased 11.5% and our market share increased 2.2 points to 40.6% over the comparable period last year, while Red Bull sales increased 0.6% and its market share decreased by 1.6% to 33.4%. Boost's sales increased 19.8%, and its market share increased 1.6 points to 13.3%. Gladiator sales decreased 12.9%, and its share decreased by 1.7 points to 8%. Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 5.8% to $601 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2013, from $568 million in the same period in 2012 and contribution margin increased to $215 million from $195.8 million in the same period in 2012. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment increased 21.7% to $29.9 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2013, compared to $24.6 million for the same period in 2012, but contribution margin decreased to $1.1 million this quarter from $1.6 million in the same quarter last year. For the 3 months ended June 30, 2013, gross sales to retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 2.9% of gross sales, down from 4.1% in 2012. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 10.7% of sales, up from 9.1% in 2012. Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 62.2% of sales, the same as in 2012. Gross sales internationally were 22.2%, marginally down from 22.6% in the same period in 2012 although were higher in actual revenues. Others sales were 2% for both the 3 months ended June 30, 2013, and 2012. Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the second quarter of 2013 amounted to $160.4 million compared to $153.4 million in the same quarter in 2012. Included in such sales were sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the second quarter of 2013, in dollars, were 13% higher than in the same period last year. In local currencies, net sales were 16% higher. Monster continues to gain momentum in that region and is growing in excess of the growth of the category. In particular, in each of the U.K., Spain, Germany and South Africa, which are our largest markets in that region, Monster achieved further market share gains. We are continuing with our expansion strategy in international markets. We launched Monster Energy in Romania and Albania in April 2013. We planned to commence sales in India but are still awaiting certain regulatory approvals before we are able to do so. We are planning to launch Monster in additional countries in Central and Eastern Europe later this year. In the Warehouse division -- sorry, excuse me, sales of the Monster Energy brand internationally, including in Japan, continue to meet expectations. However, net sales to our Japanese distributor in the 2013 second quarter was significantly lower than net sales in the comparable quarter last year, largely due to the launch of the Monster Energy brand in Japan in the second quarter of 2012. In addition, the weaker yen continued to negatively affect our gross sales in U.S. dollars, as well as our margins in Japan during the quarter. We are proceeding with our plans to commence local production in Japan and Korea. Plans for production in India are also progressing satisfactorily. Sales in Brazil continue to increase, particularly due to increased distribution achieve by Ambev. Sales in Chile were also positive during the quarter. We are planning for launch Monster Energy in certain additional countries in Asia later this year or early in 2014. Sales of Peace Tea ready-to-drink iced tea has continued to increase moderately. Consumer response to our Peace Tea 8.4-ounce cans in 12-packs and 64-ounce multi-serve PET plastic bottles was less enthusiastic than anticipated. Sales of Peace Tea in the convenience and gas channel in the 13 weeks through July 6, 2013, were 1.6% higher than in the same period last year, ahead of the category, which was down 0.2%. We are continuing to sell Worx Energy, although sales levels have decreased substantially. In the Warehouse division, sales of Hubert's Lemonades in glass bottles made good progress, although sales of soda were lower. Gross profit margins achieved in the second quarter of 2013 were 53.3% versus 51.8% in the comparable quarter in 2012. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially attributable to changes in product sales mix, particularly the higher percentage of sales represented by Ultra Zero, Ultra Blue and Rehab Pink Lemonade lines, which have higher gross margins than most of our other 16-ounce products due to lower costs of goods, as well as a reduction in certain input costs. Gross margins achieved in the quarter in North America in 2013 were higher than in the comparable quarter last year. Gross margins achieved for international sales, other than those sold from the United States, was slightly lower in the second quarter of 2013 than in the comparable quarter of 2012, primarily due to certain adjustments relating to South Africa. As previously indicated, we have covered a significant portion of our anticipated requirements for aluminum cans in 2013, as well as a significant portion of our anticipated requirements for apple juice and sugar. While we were able to achieve some reduction in certain input costs in the second quarter of 2012, we did experience limited increases in the costs of certain other raw materials during the quarter. We expect to continue to experience limited increases during the remainder of the year. We do not believe that at current levels, increases in the cost of raw materials will have a material negative effect on our margins. I just wanted to point out something. I think I misspoke when I talked about the gross margins for international. I think gross margins for international overall were slightly higher in the second quarter, but gross margins in Europe, the EMEA division, were slightly lower. I just have to give you that correction. Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales in the second quarter were 4.5% versus 4.1% in the comparable quarter in 2012 due primarily to increased freight and warehouse expenses in Europe and South Africa. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.6%, the same as in the comparable period in 2012. Sponsorships and endorsement costs were lower although cost at point of sale, merchandise displays and premiums were higher during the quarter. Cost of trade development programs to supplement other distribution partner sales as a percentage of net sales were also marginally higher during the quarter. Advertising cost was lower as we did not participate in an advertising campaign in Japan during this quarter that was similar to the campaign last year when we launched Monster in Japan. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses and, in particular, increased professional service costs for legal accounting and other professional costs. These costs, net of insurance reimbursements were $5 million higher than in the comparable quarter of 2012. Operating income was negatively affected by a combined operating loss of $1.8 million for the quarter ended July 30, 2013, from our operations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, South America and Asia, which was lower than the operating losses of $2.6 million, which were incurred by us during the same period last year, and lower than the operating losses of $2.1 million incurred in the first quarter of 2013. Our effective tax rate in the 2013 second quarter was 39.3% compared to 35.3% in 2012 second quarter. The increase in the 2013 second quarter effective tax rate was primarily the result of a decrease in the domestic production deduction, as well as the release of $1.8 million of unrecognized tax benefits during the 2012 second quarter. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $283.8 million compared to $222.5 million at December 31, 2012. Short-term investments were $148.2 million compared to $97 million at December 31, 2012. Long-term investments comprised entirely of auction rate securities decreased from $21.4 million at December 31, 2012, to $12 million at June 30, 2013. The trade account receivables are now presented on a gross basis as are promotional allowances owed to those customers that the company does not allow net settlement, such as our full-service distributors. We continue to present that portion of the promotional allowances owed to those customers that the company allows net settlement on a net basis. Accounts receivables increased to $342.2 million from $236 million at December 31, 2012. Days outstanding for receivables consistent with the above treatment were 42.8 days at June 30, 2013, and 39.2 days at December 31, 2012, compared to 40.7 days at June 30, 2012. Days outstanding for receivables are expected to increase due to the different terms generally launched to customers internationally in accordance with local practices in their respective countries. Inventories increased to $233 million from $203 million at December 31, 2012. Average days of inventory was 71.3 days at June 30, 2013, which is lower than the 80 days of inventory at December 31, 2012, and higher than the 62.7 days at June 30, 2012. At June 30, 2013, the company had auction rate securities with a face value of $19.7 million, $27.8 million at December 31, 2012, with an amortized cost basis of $17.8 million. Gross sales in July 2013 were approximately 7.9% higher than in July 2012. We caution again that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. In April 2013, the Board of Directors of the company authorized a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $200 million of the company's outstanding common stock. To date, no shares have been purchased under the April 2013 repurchase plan. As previously reported in March, the company launched a new Monster Ultra Blue line extension, as well as a Kona Cappuccino line extension to the Java Monster line. Additionally in March, the company launched a new line of 3 energy shakes called Muscle Monster, as well as a new Tea + Pink Lemonade + Energy Monster Rehab line extension. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points: one, North American gross margins remain healthy. Our 2013 second quarter gross margins for North America were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2012 and in the first quarter of 2013. Two, the U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that Monster Energy's growth is still outpacing the growth of the category as a whole on an increasing basis, particularly over the last 4 weeks. Three, the new product line extensions that have been launched are receiving good reception for both the trade, as well as from consumers. Four, turning to international markets, we are satisfied with the performance of our international expansion and the investments, particularly in the United Kingdom, Spain, Germany, South Africa, Japan and Brazil. Even though the growth of the energy drink category in Europe, which has been in existence for over 25 years, has slowed, according to Nielsen, the Monster brand achieved solid growth of 28% in that region during the second quarter of 2013. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in Europe should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in Europe vary from country to country and, for example, in countries that -- there are many countries that are dominated by mom and pops, which aren't read by Nielsen. According to Nielsen for the 4 weeks ended July 14, 2013, Monster's market share in Great Britain, Spain and France as compared to the same period last year grew from 9.1% to 10.2% in Great Britain from 13.8% to 22.3% in Spain and from 15.6% to 18.5% in France. In the 4 weeks to the end of May 2013, Monster's market share in Germany and South Africa grew from 7.0% to 8.6% in Germany and from 15.4% to 18% in South Africa. Seven, sales of Monster in Japan remain encouraging. Eight, although the energy category as a whole has struggled in Korea, sales of Monster Energy have been satisfactory since their launch. Nine, although we have incurred some delays in getting regulatory approval for the sale of Monster Energy in India, we believe that we will be able to secure such approval in the near future. We view India as an exciting future growth opportunity for Monster. 10, the sales in Brazil through our new distribution partner, Ambev, continue to be robust. 11, sales of Hubert's Lemonade are exceeding our expectations. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alton Stump of Longbow Research.
Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: I just wanted to ask, I think you mentioned that Monster's sales were up 16.4%, per AC Nielsen, in the last 4 weeks of July or in the 4 weeks of July. But yet your overall growth sales were up 7.9%. Is there any reason for the disconnect? Or is it just timing of actual wholesale inventory levels? Any color that you can give us there?
Rodney C. Sacks: The periods are slightly different. It is for the convenience channel, which is our stronger channel. I think the brand has done better in the convenience channel than in the drug and grocery channels, particularly in the quarter. We simply don't have any other explanation.
Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And then just one quick follow-up. On the margin of front, sort of one of your better gross margin performances in quite some time year-over-year. I mean, obviously, the lower sales overseas were part of that. But was there anything in the U.S., specifically, if you strip out the regional mix that drove those margins higher?
Rodney C. Sacks: No, I think -- I did mention it earlier. It was a product mix. We think that the higher proportion of our sales are coming from the Ultra line and Rehab. And those product lines have better growth, lower costs and better gross margins through certainly input costs, ingredients and some other costs.
Operator: Our next question comes from Amit Sharma, BMO Capital Markets.
Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Rodney, can you address the fact that some of the non-Red Bull/Monster brands, if we look at the major channels, the sales and share for those brands are declining rapidly whereas Monster and Red Bull are continuing to gain share. Is there a dynamic that those trends are impacted by the noise a little bit more than Red Bull and Monster? Or anything else going on there?
Rodney C. Sacks: I don't know. I just think that what is happening is there are -- if we look at some of the brands, even some of our SKUs are also slowing and they're being a little negative. I just think that the market is sort of dividing and you've got the major 2 brands that have got the major space. They seem to have the major variety. Red Bull has got some lift due to their new innovation there. They introduced 3 new SKUs, sort of flavor extensions. And so if you take their innovation and our innovation together, which has been the bulk of innovation in the category, I think that's sort of probably the main driver of the fact that it's those 2 brands that are driving the growth in the category.
Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Great. And if I may ask one more. The panel hearing that you talked about earlier in the call, are you or the industry as a whole participating in that?
Rodney C. Sacks: Which panel hearing-- you are talking about, the IOM hearing?
Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Yes, the IOM hearing.
Rodney C. Sacks: At the IOM hearing, it's really run by IOM. There are diversions, lots of views. We did have some representatives at the IOM, some medical representatives who made some points, which, we believe, countered some misconceptions or inaccurate views that may have been given by some of the speakers. Others speakers were clearly positive, and we feel comfortable based on the science on the safety of our products. And obviously, that is what we try to communicate in so far as we stood up at the meeting. But that panel has had a hearing. They're going to make some recommendations to the FDA, and then we'll hear from that and just see where that goes to.
Hilton H. Schlosberg: And the American Beverage Association was also represented at the panel.
Rodney C. Sacks: Yes, they also had medical representatives there, too, to correct certain inaccurate or incorrect statements or views.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Pecoriello of Consumer Edge Research.
William Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: Similar to the July question, your sales in June, your shipments had a slowdown pretty considerably versus April and May. I know there's a lot of noise month to month, but the consumer scanner data, including grocery, convenience store, all of that, in the U.S. and Europe don't show that kind of magnitude of slowdown in June. So is there anything that you could point to in terms of specific retailers or distributors that had cut back on ordering in June that would had that kind of a disconnect? Because your sales -- your shipments are almost flattish, given what you had disclosed on April and May data.
Rodney C. Sacks: We sell from month-to-month, and I think that June selling in is probably just -- it may have been a shorter delivery days, it may have been -- for whatever the reason, our June's often have tended to be a little lower. We just don't try and ship or worry about month-to-month shipments. We did see a little bit of reduction in inventories from some of our distributor partners in Europe in this year versus last year as opposed to the particular quarter, but I'm not sure when that actually took place. But I don't have any other color on it. The sales are just how they come out.
William Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: Right. And there was convenience store operator that was talking about discontinuing energy drinks. I was wondering if there was anything related to any large convenience store retailers or anything like that, that cut back on their orders in June?
Rodney C. Sacks: I don't think so, and I think that, that comment was inaccurate. I don't think that was -- I think there was a distributor that was debating or dealing with Energy Shots...
Hilton H. Schlosberg: Reseller.
Rodney C. Sacks: A reseller, sorry, dealing with how to deal with Shots and sort of -- and I think it's not a discontinuing but it was as to whether he personally or they wanted to have an age limit for purchases of Energy Shots. But it was not addressed to energy drinks unless it was maybe one specific energy drink that has a very high caffeine level, that it may have -- there was one article that suggested that he may have put that into the category but not to the energy drinks in general.
Hilton H. Schlosberg: But we've always struggled to really compare our sales with Nielsen numbers. There's always a disconnect. And sometimes, they come together, sometimes they don't.
Operator: Our next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So first, just in terms of the impact from Japan, just lapping the pipe sales last year, can you quantify how much of that was? And then just in terms of what you're seeing in Japan, kind of consumer takeaway numbers, is there any issue there just in terms of other than lapping that pipe sale? Because it looks like the international sales, Europe, you had at 13%. I mean, Canada, Mexico still seems to be up. So it seems like Japan was really a big, big factor there.
Rodney C. Sacks: Japan was a factor because of the difference in last year to this year. That is correct. Sales were also affected somewhat by military sales outside -- export outside to overseas, basically due to the reduction in troops, and that affected sales as well internationally. I think that we wouldn't like to disclose the -- or go into the detail of sales on a country base because then that starts just becoming on every country and just becomes -- starts becoming a precedent, which we wouldn't like to break down. But it was -- and there was a difference there. We just had a very orchestrated -- the launch was very effective in Japan. The retailers were effective in getting it on the shelf very quickly, and so it really was a good launch. The brand is still doing very well in Japan. We've introduced -- launched Absolutely Zero the Khaos brand, the distribution did fall off a little bit at a lower rate of sale. The Japanese retailers really have very high rate of sales standards. And as with any line extension, it does generally sell less, particularly in our case. All our lines sell less than the Original Green. And so there has been some loss of distribution on Khaos, but we have Absolutely Zero in the market. And overall, our sales are doing nicely there, particularly Green. We've secured some vending machine distribution. And we are hoping, going through by the end of the year, our distributor has given us an assurance that they will put us into a large number of their additional vending machines that they either control or they have contracts with.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then just taking a step back on EMEA. When you look at your performance in the U.S. markets from really an underlying consumer takeaway perspective, we've seen now data stabilize and now the latest 4 weeks showing up 16%-plus. So when you kind of look at your business in the category, the health of your business, health of the category, do you think we're at the point where some of the negative publicity that impacted negatively sort of the early 2013 performance is abating in that, that the category trends, the newer trends, in particular, actually accelerating? And then the same comments sort of on the international front because some of the category comments seems a little bit more cautious. So I'm just wondering how you're thinking about some of international markets today versus, say, 3, 6 months ago and how that plays out for the rest of the year.
Rodney C. Sacks: Judy, just talking about the local markets, again, we had sort of initially thought that we would see the local markets sort of rebound a little earlier. But it did tend to stay in the low single-digit increases until June. We have seen the increase. So if you look at the increases, it went down to a 3.5% growth at Convenience. It went down to 3.5% in the 4 weeks to April and then to 3.2% in May. Then it's picked up to 3.6% and 6.1% in the Convenience category, and that's where our sales have also sort of followed that trend. It was down. Our increases were higher but lower in the 4 weeks in April and May, and then we picked up again in June and we picked up again. So we are seeing an increasing trend now from April to July in the Convenience channel, which is our biggest channel, as I indicated. Internationally, we don't know the reasons. We would assume that they are similar just to a lot of the noise that's been going on, plus the fact that, I think, their economies are still struggling. But there has clearly been a weakening in the category. But again, we've seen that for other reasons completely extraneous to the current noise, where the category has slowed for a while or over a period of time and then it's picked up and slowed. It's had that sort of roller coaster literally for over the last 10 or so years or more. So we're just seeing our sort of growth still strong. We're still making -- taking share in the major markets, plus many of the smaller markets. So our sort of expansion into newer markets is probably slowing a little bit. As we're focusing on the existing markets where in, we will still expand. But it certainly won't be at the rate over the past couple of years, and we think that will also -- going forward, will be positive for the company and the results internationally.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Chappell of SunTrust.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Rodney and Hilton, I understand it's pretty noble not to blame weather, but it seems like every beverage company on the planet at some point has now blamed weather in the most recent quarters. So can you tell us, was there any impact or was this really just category trends slowing down in Europe and U.S., which also happened to have adverse weather conditions?
Rodney C. Sacks: Well, we don't have weather in our vocabulary. You know that. I think that weather does play a part in every beverage. But we really don't know what effect it has. We don't measure it. We don't -- and that's why sometimes when weather is up, we don't say, "Well, we did great because of weather. We did badly because of weather." We generally tend to try and manage the business outside of the weather issues. I mean, we just don't do it and address it like that. Summer became late in Europe, but now summer is fine. I mean, we don't know. And it's hot in Texas, but it's not as hot in California. I'm sitting here with a sweater on. I don't know. It's just not a factor. The same as seasonality. I think seasonality does play a role. But again, it sort of -- and we make mention of it, as we have historically, but because there is difference in winter and summer consumption. But again, those aren't as major for us, we think, in the energy category.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay. It was worth a shot. A follow-up just on some of the onetime charges and maybe looking at like the legal expenses. Would you expect kind of a similar rate for the next couple of quarters? Or can you give any kind of color of how we should look at that?
Rodney C. Sacks: I think that -- we're not sure. We think that some of the regulatory issues sort of didn't -- not so much came to a head, but we needed to address a number of issues back to the FDA, and which we did. We dealt with -- anticipated the hearings at the Senate and the IOM. And so there were a number of issues that we addressed for the first time in preparing for it. And I think going forward, we won't have that same degree of preparation, which means we're at that same degree perhaps of intense litigation in that side. But then there is other litigation continuing to go on, different litigation, different forums, and it all depends on what level they reach. And also the timing of that litigation because if you get into discovery periods, you then will start to have a ramp. There's no discovery at that point in time obviously, then there aren't a lot of costs. So it's difficult to say what the costs will be. I think we will see a reasonable level of costs being incurred in the foreseeable future till these matters settle down and we get to start going in one direction.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel.
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: So I'm going to try to come at this discrepancy between scanner data and reported results in a different way. Do you have any idea what channel inventories looks like? Based on stuff that we've looked at, it seems like there's been now 5 straight quarters of pretty substantial destocking. I mean, do you get a sense that the distributors, retailers are running leaner than they have over the last couple of years?
Rodney C. Sacks: I don't know. I know that, as I've said in Europe, they discussed it with us. And so they communicated to us, some of our larger distributors there. So we obviously knew that there is a destocking going on we were aware. But I don't know. I haven't had anything communicated to me. And I presume -- I plainly presume that our senior sales people who deal with our distributors would have communicated to me if they'd known about-- or they felt it was material. But they may just not know. So I'm making assumptions, which I shouldn't actually. I just don't know.
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. Well, I guess just operationally, if you guys are looking at scanner data and you see what you see and you're reporting something different, then how do you get comfortable with the business that you're running that the demand is what it's going to be going forward then?
Rodney C. Sacks: Well, I think the scanner data, we run our business according to the scanner data. I mean, the scanner data covers certain channels. It doesn't cover the whole market. It is also an extrapolation. There's differences in timing because we are not going direct to the market. We're going to our distributor, then our distributor's going to the retailers, putting it on the shelves. There is a delayed function between those 2, the 3 tier. And we deal with our sales on a daily basis and see ourselves come in and manage ourselves according to our sales. We have projections. They sometimes are accurate, sometimes less accurate, and manage ourselves according to what we sell. It's our sell out. We can't control anything else other than see what the scanner data comes in at, and then you try to reconcile it. And we do try our best. Sometimes we're behind the scanner data, and sometimes we're ahead.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Hilton, can you comment on now much improvement you're expecting for international profitability in the back half of the year as you continue to build scale? And given some of the onetime costs from last year, should we expect a significant margin improvement in the back half?
Hilton H. Schlosberg: Okay. You know we don't give forecasts, and we don't give guidance and we don't give projections. So you know I cannot give that answer.
Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. Well, I was just wondering more kind of conceptually how do you think about the margin performance going forward.
Hilton H. Schlosberg: I don't see why margins should differ -- gross margins should differ to any degree going forward other than with foreign exchange rates. But I don't give projections, and we don't give guidance. So I think that's what we do.
Rodney C. Sacks: The only thing I would point out is that we have the FX loss, which is an exceptional item. But you also have -- our revenues do get affected by foreign exchange rates and when we convert that. For example, obviously, in Japan, in South Africa, where the rand depreciated quite a bit against the dollar over the last year, we've seen a drop in revenues. And that also affects our ability. Obviously, it affects our margins in those countries, where some of our expenses are full dollar-based or we just have less margins. So going forward, that's the only thing that might affect our margins is really more related to foreign currencies that we can really look at. But other than that, I agree with Hilton, it should be the same as we go.
Hilton H. Schlosberg: We spoke about local production, and we're very far advanced in production in Japan. But we don't believe that's going to do much this year. Certainly next year, but not this year. So I just would rather just end this discussion because we just don't give guidance.
Operator: Our next question comes from Caroline Levy of CLSA.
Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Rodney and Hilton, a couple of questions on Japan. Just I guess, you've answered on the timing of the production. You probably have it up and running by the end of the year, so the benefit is next year. Is that right?
Rodney C. Sacks: Correct. We had a new can manufactured for us because of the size we use, which has now been done, and we're now getting change parts fitted to our line. And we'd get there by the end of the year. That's our schedule.
Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Okay. So just to follow up on that, and then one more. But Japan, the impact on gross margin, was there any benefit from selling less in Japan to your gross margin? And then the final bit, could you just help us understand what you think Ultra's appeal is to consumers? It's obviously hugely successful. What niche is it filling? Because I don't truly understand what makes someone think of that versus a base Monster.
Rodney C. Sacks: I think the -- let me start with the second question first. The base Monster has its own unique flavor, which sort of whatever -- for want of a better description, call it an energy drink flavor or profile and taste. The juice drinks tended to go away from that and had more of a juice feeling. The Ultra line has much more of a soft drink easy-to-drink flavor that is light. It's not as filling. And for whatever reason, we were able to come up with a flavor profile that clearly has appealed across a lot of categories and not simply to the diet drinker. Because it has 0 calories, it obviously appealed to the diet drinker directly square on, just as Absolutely Zero did as distinct from, for example, even our low carb, which had 10 calories per serving. But then again, our low carb had the Monster profile. So this is a completely different set of profiles, which is just lighter and more drinkable and probably more on a soft drink vein than the traditional energy drinks.
Hilton H. Schlosberg: And then, Caroline, I'll give you an answer to your first question. The margins were actually lower this year than last year, and one of the big factors, of course, was foreign exchange in Japan.
Operator: And now I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks.
Rodney C. Sacks: On behalf of Monster, I would like to thank everyone for their continued support of the company. We remain confident in the safety of our product and our growth strategy and are committed to developing and differentiating our brands and expanding the Monster brand, both domestically and internationally. Again, we reiterate that our products are safe and are properly labeled. The caffeine content in Monster Energy is approximately 10 milligrams per ounce, which is less than 1/2 the milligrams per ounce of caffeine contained in coffeehouse-brewed coffee. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect, and have a wonderful day.

An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated May 8, 2013. A copy of this information is also available on our website, www.monsterbevcorp.com, in the Financial Information section. Once again, we reiterate that our products are safe based on both our and the industry's long track record and the scientific evidence supporting the safety of our ingredients. We estimate that about 50 billion cans of energy drinks have been sold and safely consumed worldwide over the past 25 years, including more than 9 billion Monster Energy drinks over the past 11 years. In 2012, we sold some 2 billion cans of Monster Energy drinks in approximately 90 countries. Put it in another way, more than 5 million cans of Monster Energy drinks are sold and safely consumed around the world everyday. To the best of our knowledge, the FDA's position is that it continues to believe that there is a long history of safe use of products containing caffeine in the U.S. and that the average amount of caffeine consumed by the U.S. population has not increased in spite of the entry of energy drinks into the marketplace. The FDA has stated that available studies do not indicate any new previously unknown risks associated with caffeine consumption. The FDA has announced that it intends to convene a third-party review panel to help determine whether energy drinks pose particular risks to teenagers or people with underlying health problems, which we anticipate will take place later this year. The FDA has also announced last week that it will investigate the safety of caffeine in food products, particularly its effects on children and adolescents, in response to a trend in which caffeine is being added to a growing number of products such as gum. Unfortunately, inaccurate, speculative and biased articles continue to be published in the media regarding energy drinks and, in particular, the caffeine levels therein. The simplest and most effective way of addressing those comments is to compare the caffeine levels in Monster Energy drinks from all sources to the caffeine levels of coffeehouse coffees, such as, for example, Starbucks or Caribou, as this comparison is easily understood by and is meaningful to consumers. Coffee has been and continues to be extensively and safely consumed everyday in the U.S. by many tens of millions of consumers, many of whom are teenagers. In making such comparison, we believe it is appropriate to use Starbucks' 16-ounce medium-sized brewed coffee, which is the same size as a regular 16-ounce Monster Energy drink. A Starbucks 16-ounce brewed coffee contains approximately 330 milligrams of caffeine, which is double the approximate 160 milligrams of caffeine in the same sized Monster Energy drink. A 16-ounce Caribou brewed coffee contains between 305 and 370 milligrams of caffeine. Based on statistics provided by the research firm, NPD, we believe that coffee consumption in the U.S. by teens under 18 is significantly higher than their consumption of energy drinks. With respect to the Fournier case, which we are continuing to vigorously defend, discovery is proceeding. At this time, we do not have any further update to provide on that case. In October 2012, the city attorney of San Francisco wrote to the company, requesting information concerning the advertising and marketing of its Monster Energy drinks and specifically concerning the safety of its products for consumption by adolescents. In December 2012, the company provided a detailed response to that letter. In March 2013, the city attorney of San Francisco sent a demand letter to the company, in which he threatened claims against Monster, unless Monster agreed to reformulate its products to lower the caffeine content, provide additional warning labels, cease promoting over consumption in marketing, cease the alleged use of alcohol and drug references in marketing and cease allegedly targeting minors. From that demand letter and other correspondence, it appeared that he had disregarded the established body of authoritative literature that had previously been submitted to him and other facts and information in the company's December response. The demand letter also made bold, unsubstantiated allegations against the company. While Monster, nevertheless, was willing to meet with the city attorney and his staff to discuss ways in which we could genuinely seek agreement on a number of issues of concern, in preparation for the meeting that had been scheduled, the city attorney presented the company with a proposed stipulated injunction that would have imposed a wide range of onerous, unfounded and unacceptable limitations on the company's ability to market and sell its products. After receiving the proposed injunction, the company concluded that notwithstanding the active involvement of the FDA and the clear delegation by Congress to the FDA of the power to deal with issues involving food safety and labeling, neither evidence-based discussions nor statutory or constitutional limitations on the city attorney's jurisdiction were likely to dissuade the city attorney from his misguided crusade against the company. Therefore, we determined that court intervention was necessary. Consequently, the company filed a complaint against the city attorney in federal court in the United States District Court Central District of California, Eastern Division, seeking, among other remedies, declaratory and injunctive relief to protect the company's interests. In response, on 6th of May, 2013, the city attorney of San Francisco filed a complaint against the company in state court in San Francisco, in which he claims that the company has engaged in unfair and unlawful business practices under the California Consumer Protection Law Section 17200 and requests an injunction against the company restoration of moneys [ph] to consumer and penalties. The company intends to vigorously defend against that action. The company continues to deal with various clause-action [ph] complaints that have been received by it over the past few months regarding the labeling and/or safety of our energy drink products but which the company believes to be without merit. The company intends to vigorously defend against those claims. The company assumes no obligation to update any statements made with respect to ongoing litigation and regulatory matters, including with respect to the foregoing disclosures, whether it's new information, future events or otherwise, other than as required by law. Given the current litigation and pending regulatory requests, we will refrain from answering questions or commenting further on these specific subjects. We are happy, of course, to answer questions you may have about our products in general or about the first quarter results as best as we can after we have concluded our discussion on the business. Turning to the business. In the first quarter of 2013, the beverage market continued to experience softness in general. In particular, the 3 major soft drink companies in the U.S., in connection with their respective quarterly reports, reported that the CSD volumes in the U.S. were down in the first quarter of 2013. The softness in the energy drink market that I alluded to in my previous conference call on February 27, 2013 continued through the first quarter of 2013, we believe, partially due to the ongoing negative publicity that continues to appear in the media, questioning the safety of energy drinks and suggesting limitations on their ingredients, including caffeine and/or the levels thereof and/or minimum age restrictions for consumers. In some of our international markets, the energy drink category also appears to have slowed in the quarter. The successful launch of Monster Ultra Zero in the third quarter of 2012, while contributing to the increase in sales of the company, resulted in some cannibalization generally across existing SKUs. According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through April 27, 2013, in the convenience and gas channel, Zero Ultra has become our second best-selling SKU after our Original Monster Green. During the first quarter, our operating income was negatively affected by costs incurred by us to terminate certain of our prior distributors in parts of New York and San Diego amounting to $8.3 million. Such costs were expensed in full in the quarter. The amount that will be received from our new distributors for those areas will be approximately equal to such costs. However, such amounts are required to be accounted for as deferred revenue and may only be recognized as revenue, ratably, over the anticipated life of the respective distribution agreements, generally 20 years. On a cash flow basis, however, those transactions are, in fact, neutral to the company. During the quarter, we incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $4.7 million, primarily related to our operations in Japan and South Africa. Additionally, during the quarter, we incurred increased professional service costs of $4.9 million, net of insurance reimbursements, of which $3 million is related to regulatory matters and related to litigation concerning the company's Monster Energy brand energy drinks, which, we believe, are extraordinary in nature. The net effect of all of these items on the operating income of the company amounts to approximately $16 million. We're already seeing the benefits of the distributor changes in New York and San Diego and are hopeful that our sales and market shares in those respective territories will increase during the remaining quarters of 2013. The company continued to make progress in the first quarter and achieved record first quarter gross sales up 7.3% to $555 million, with net sales up 6.5% to $484.2 million. Operating income was down 15% to $107.3 million. Our tax rate was slightly lower this quarter at 39.8% versus 39.9% in the same quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share decreased 10.4% from $0.41 per share in the first quarter of 2012 to $0.37 per share in the first quarter of 2013. While we are pleased with the results we achieved in the first quarter, our revenues were affected by less robust growth for the energy category as a whole and Monster Energy in our principal market, United States, as well as in Canada and Mexico, in the first quarter. Sales of our new Monster Zero Ultra, which did result in some cannibalization generally across our existing SKUs, sales of Worx Energy Shots were also lower. Relatively flat sales in our Warehouse division, less robust growth of the energy category overall in Europe, Middle East and Africa. Despite such slowdown, Monster was still able to achieve 34% growth in dollars in that region. As discussed on previous conference calls, we will be reporting on Nielsen's extended sample of outlets, which includes Wal-Mart; dollar stores, such as Family Dollar, Dollar General and Fred's; DeCA military stores; and club stores, namely Sam's and BJ's, but excluding Costco. According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through April 27, 2013, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, on an expanded basis I just described, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including Shots, increased by 2.8% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 7.1% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 9.5%. Sales of Rockstar decreased by 2.5%, and sales of 5-Hour decreased by 13.1%. Sales of AMP were down 20.8%. NOS increased 7.3%, and sales of Full Throttle decreased 3%. According to the Nielsen report for the 4 weeks ended April 27, 2013, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel, in dollars, increased by 3.5% over the comparable 4-week period in 2012. Sales of Monster increased by 6.5% over the comparable period last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 13.7% over the same period. Rockstar was down 2.8%, while 5-Hour was down 14.7%. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April 27, 2013, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 1 point over the comparable period a year ago to 32.9% against Red Bull's share of 35.9%, Rockstar's share of 7.4%, 5-Hour share of 10.2% and AMP's share of 3.1%. According to Nielsen, in the 13 weeks ended April 27, 2013, sales of energy plus coffee drinks, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel increased 7.8% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 18.3% higher than in the comparable period last year, while Starbucks Double Shot Energy was down 1.9%. Sales of Java Monster exceeded sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy drinks. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended April 6, 2013, the energy drink category grew 7%. Monster sales increased 6%. Our market share is 24.8%, which is point -- 2 points lower than in the comparable period last year. Red Bull sales increased 11%, and its market share increased 1.3 points to 37.6%. Rockstar sales increased 7%, and its market share remained flat at 16.3%. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 5 weeks ended March 30, 2013, sales of energy drinks grew 9%. Over this period, sales of Red Bull increased 15.4%, sales of Monster decreased of 2.6%, while sales of Rockstar increased 28.6%. According to Nielsen, in all outlets combined in Mexico for the month of March 2013, the energy drink category grew 6.8%. Monster sales increased 1.2%, but our market share decreased 1.9 points to 33.8% from the comparable period last year; while Red Bull sales increased 10%, and its market share increased by 1.1% to 37.6%. Boost's sales increased 20.3%, and its market share increased 1.3 points to 12%; and Gladiator sales increased 1.8%, and its market share decreased by 0.7 points to 13.4%. Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 6.7% to $460.2 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2013 from $431.2 million in the same period in 2012, and contribution margin decreased from $149.1 million to $139 million. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment increased to $24 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2013 compared to $23.4 million for the same period in 2012, but contribution margin decreased to $0.4 million this quarter from $2.2 million in the same quarter last year. For the 3 months ended March 31, 2013, gross sales to retail, grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 3% of gross sales, down from 4% in 2012. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 10% of sales, the same as in 2012. Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 62% of sales, down from 65% in 2012. Gross sales internationally increased to 23% from 19% in the same period in 2012. Other sales were 2% for the 3 months ended both March 31, 2013 and 2012. Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the first quarter of 2013 amounted to $130.7 million compared to $100.6 million in the same quarter in 2012. Included in such sales were sales to the company's military customers which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. Net sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa in the first quarter of 2013, in dollars, was -- were 34% higher than in the same period last year. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and market share in Europe and South Africa. In particular, the U.K., Germany, Spain, and South Africa all experienced substantial sales and market share gains. We are continuing with our expansion strategy into new international markets. We launched Monster Energy in Romania and Albania in April 2013 and are planning to commence sales in India shortly. We are planning to launch Monster in additional countries in Central and Eastern Europe later this year. Sales in Japan in the first quarter continued to exceed our expectations. Although product damage has been substantially reduced, the weaker yen negatively affected our gross margins in Japan during the quarter. Our plan to commence local production in Japan, Korea and India is progressing satisfactorily. Sales in Brazil through Ambev commenced at the end of January. In the results, sales in the first quarter in Brazil were substantially higher than in the comparable quarter last year. Sales of Peace Tea ready-to-drink iced tea has continued to progress. Gross sales increased by 11.3% over the same period in 2012. We recently launched certain flavors of Peace Tea in 8.4-ounce cans in 12-unit multi-pack containers and 64-ounce multi-serve PET plastic bottles. We are continuing to sell Worx Energy, although sales levels have decreased substantially. In the Warehouse division, sales of Hubert's Lemonades in glass bottles continue to make good progress, although sales of sodas were weaker. Gross profit margins achieved in the first quarter of 2013 was 52.1% versus 53.1% in the comparable quarter in 2012, but higher than the gross profit margin achieved in the fourth quarter of 2012 of 51.7%. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially attributable to geographic mix. Gross margins achieved for international sales, other than those sold from the United States, were lower in the first quarter of 2013 than in the comparable quarter in 2012. Gross margins achieved in the quarter in North America in 2013 were slightly higher than in the comparable quarter last year. We have now covered a significant portion of our anticipated requirements for aluminum cans in 2013, as well as a significant portion of our anticipated requirements for apple juice and sugar. We did experience cost increases in certain raw materials in the first quarter of 2013 and expect to continue to experience limited increases during the remainder of the year. However, we do not believe that, at current levels, the increases in the cost of raw materials will have a material negative effect on our margins. Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales in the first quarter were 4.6% versus 4.3% in the comparable quarter in 2012, primarily due to excess freights incurred in North America, as a result of the temporary cessation of production at a plant in Texas which resulted in product being shipped into that state from California and elsewhere. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 13.5% from 12.3% in the same period in 2012, primarily due to increased social media and Internet marketing costs, premiums, sponsorships and point of sale. Additionally, costs of trade development programs to supplement our distribution partners' sales forces to service and merchandise a small independent store channel, particularly in Europe, were substantially higher in the first quarter than in the comparable period last year. The cost of trade development, personnel and sampling teams are included as part of our selling expenses and do not form part of our payroll costs. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses and, in particular, increased professional service costs for legal, accounting and other professional costs. These costs, net of insurance reimbursements, were $4.9 million higher than in the comparable quarter of 2012. Additionally, travel costs were substantially higher in the first quarter than in the comparable quarter last year. Many of the increases in SG&A spending were planned based on increased budgeted sales, which did not fully materialize. Operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $2.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2013 from our operations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, South America and Asia, as compared to operating losses of $4.3 million for the same period last year. As I mentioned earlier, the increase in operating expenses was partially attributable to increased expenditures for terminating existing distributors and professional service costs. In addition, the increase in operating expenses was due to increased payroll expenses of $2.9 million, increased outbound freight and warehouse costs of $2.6 million, increased expenditures of $2.4 million for other marketing expenses, increased expenditures of $2 million for premiums, increased expenditures of $1.9 million for sponsorships and endorsements and increased expenditures of $1.7 million for allocated trade development. Our effective tax rate in the 2013 first quarter was 39.8% compared to 39.9% in the 2012 first quarter. The decrease in the 2013 first quarter effective tax rate was primarily the result of establishing a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of our foreign subsidiary established during the first quarter of 2012. The decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the establishment of a full valuation allowance against a tax capital loss recognized on the sale of certain available for sale auction rate securities, as well as the higher effective tax rate in certain foreign jurisdictions. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $242.5 million compared to $222.5 million at December 31, 2012. Short-term investments were $102.1 million compared to $97 million at December 31, 2012. Long-term investments comprised entirely of auction rate securities decreased from $21.4 million at December 31, 2012 to $13.6 million. Trade accounts receivables are now presented on a gross basis, as are promotional allowances owed to those customers that the company does not allow a net settlement, such as our full-service distributors. We continue to present that portion of the promotional allowances owed to those customers that the company allows net settlement on a net basis. Trade accounts receivables increased to $308.7 million from $236 million at December 31, 2012. Days outstanding for receivables, consistent with the above treatment, were 50.4 days at March 31, 2013 and 39.2 days at December 31, 2012 compared to 44.8 days at March 31, 2012. As sales outside the United States continued to increase as a proportion of our overall sales, days outstanding for receivables are expected to increase due to the different terms generally granted to customers internationally in accordance with local practices in their respective countries. Inventories increased to $215.3 million from $203.1 million at December 31, 2012. The average days of inventory were 83.5 days at March 31, 2013, which is higher than the 80.3 days of inventory at December 31, 2012 and 75.5 days at March 31, 2012. At March 31, 2013, the company had auction rate securities with a face value of $19.5 million worth $27.8 million at December 31, 2012, with an amortized cost basis of $17.4 million. Gross sales in April 2013 were approximately 5.7% higher than in April 2012. We caution again that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. During the 2013 first quarter, the company purchased an additional 0.3 million shares of its stock at an average purchase price of $51.99 per share, which exhausted the availability under the then current repurchase plan. Subsequent to quarter end, the Board of Directors approved a new repurchase plan of $200 million. The company has not repurchased any of its shares pursuant to the April 2013 repurchase plan. In March, the company launched a new Monster Ultra Blue line extension, as well as a Kona Cappuccino line extension to the Java Monster line. Additionally, in March, the company launched a new line of 3 energy shakes called Muscle Monster that contain 25 grams of protein in 15-ounce cans, as well as the new Tea + Pink Lemonade + Energy Monster Rehab line extension. Additionally, the company launched Monster mini take-home 12 packs, containing 8-ounce cans, as well as Peace Tea take-home 12 packs containing 8.4-ounce cans. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. One, North American gross margins remain healthy. Our 2013 first quarter gross margins for North America were actually higher than in the comparable quarter in 2012 and in the fourth quarter of 2012. U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that Monster Energy's growth is still outpacing the growth of the category as a whole. Three, new distribution arrangements with Big Geyser for the Greater New York area and Anheuser-Busch distributors for the San Diego areas have been implemented, and the initial results from both areas have been positive. Four, new product line extensions that have been launched are receiving good reception from both the trade, as well as from consumers. Five, turning to international markets, we are satisfied with the performance of our international expansion and investments, particularly in the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, South Africa, Japan and Brazil. Six, even though the energy drink category has been in existence in Europe for over 25 years, our EMEA markets are still, on average, experiencing solid growth, and the Monster brand continues to grow well in excess of the category. Seven, according to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended March 23, 2013, Monster's market share in Great Britain increased to 10.3% from 7.4% in the same period last year. In Spain, Monster's market share in the 4 weeks through February 28, 2013 increased to 18.5% from 12.9% in the same period last year. In Germany, in the 4 weeks through February 28, 2013, Monster's market share grew to 9.3% from 5.9% in the same period in the previous year. And in South Africa, Monster's market share in the 4 weeks through February 28, 2013, grew to 16.8% from 11.9% in the same period last year. Sales of Monster in Japan remain encouraging, and the brand has achieved substantial value share in the market in the modern convenience trade channel. Nine, we have launched Monster Energy in Korea, and the commencement of sales of Monster in India is anticipated shortly and which we view as an exciting future growth opportunity for Monster. Finally, ten, Southern Brazil, through our new distribution partner, Ambev, has been strong since they commenced distribution at the end of January. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go to the next question, which comes from Kaumil Gajrawala of UBS.
Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Your trends have tracked Nielsen much more closely in the quarters and years in the past, yet, that wasn't the case in this quarter. Was there something unique going on in this quarter on why trends in the U.S. were -- seemed to be materially different from what was in the Nielsen data?
Rodney C. Sacks: Yes. We just don't -- we don't know.
Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. Could it be something maybe tied to inventory levels or, particularly, with the change in the distributor in New York?
Rodney C. Sacks: We don't think so. I mean, we did take back some inventory from our previous distributors. That came back in. But we don't think those would have materially affected the numbers. So we just don't have a -- we just don't have any reason for the differences.
Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. As you look at the Nielsen data that you cited on the call earlier today, it did feel like, as you went country-by-country, that the current data seems to be in line with how your trends are doing?
Rodney C. Sacks: Generally, the -- our sales out [ph] just seemed to be lagging a little bit in North America, but not by much. But they do seem to be generally in line.
Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. Understood. And then, finally, on Zero Ultra, is the shelf space incremental, or is it coming from maybe pruning some of the brands in your portfolio?
Rodney C. Sacks: It's very difficult to tally. it varies from store to store. In order to get the product on shelf quickly, obviously, a lot of our distributors cut into existing shelf space because we had -- we have a certain number of shelves that we've agreed, and we have the shelf space so they would have cut into that to get a single facing. And then, because of [indiscernible] two facings. But as we continued to get shelf programs for 2013, we have continued to expand and take that into account. So in some cases, it's -- we've had to sort of juggle the shelf space because there's only so much space available on the shelves. In other cases, in other chains, we have picked up some incremental space through that and other -- the other sort of line extensions. So it's mixed. I don't have any express answer.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Faucher of JPMorgan.
John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I just want to talk a little bit about the cadence within the quarters. Most companies, we get concerned when we feel like, okay, trends are better in the last month of the quarter because they're struggling to make the numbers. You guys have had sort of the opposite situation, where the first month of the quarter starts out really strong and then maybe not as strong as we go through the quarter. Do you guys have any thoughts in terms of maybe what's causing that type of shipment pattern? Is it new product launches? Is it new distributors starting in the beginning of the quarter? Any color, so we can get a better handle in terms of why the trend seemed to decelerate through the quarter?
Rodney C. Sacks: We really don't have any explanation. It changes from quarter-to-quarter. They simply are what they are and sometimes quarters end stronger and sometimes they don't. The trends just change from month to month. We really do have a volatile set of numbers from month-to-month, and that's why we continue to caution that these numbers are single months. And we just -- they just are what they are. As you indicated, they change from quarter-to-quarter.
John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Got it. And then, with Red Bull launching their first flavored new products in a long time, you're getting a sense from your retail customers, it seems though there's an opportunity that, that could bring more news to the category and potentially reaccelerate the category. I realize it's still early days from that standpoint. Are you seeing any impact to the category trends from these competitive launches?
Rodney C. Sacks: Not really. The -- I think that Red Bull has got a lift in their sales, as you can see from some of the Nielsen numbers, and we think that, that is largely due to the introduction of these new additional flavors. A lot of that is trial. A lot of that is -- they're different for the first time. The first time they've had a new flavor for a long time. There are other flavors. Even the Total Zero is very similar to their -- the profile of their existing Red Bull. So this was a complete change. And so, ultimately, you're going to get trial extra shelf space from -- there's a lot of promotion going around the 8 oz. We can see the promotional activity in the Red Bull sales numbers and dollar sales they have -- they are promoting quite heavily, their 8 oz. quite heavily. So it's too soon to tell where it's going to go. In Europe, generally, they've not really succeeded in driving incremental sales and even shelf space. But certainly, incremental sales on a longer-term basis, but we are seeing some trial. And so, we've just got to wait a little while. I think it's just premature. And so, that -- overall, I think that it may help the category to basically bring in additional consumers. I think that will be so. But the extent of that, we don't know.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Chappell of SunTrust.
Sarah Miller: This is Sarah Miller on for Bill. I was just wondering if we could get a little bit more color around the local manufacturing that you're setting up in Japan and Korea and kind of how that's going to affect the cadence of gross margin trends for the rest of the year?
Rodney C. Sacks: Well, as soon as we are able to get those production facilities up and running, we will -- we believe, we will achieve substantially improved margins in those areas. We'll also eliminate, we believe, a lot of the -- or a large portion of the damages we're incurring in shipping beverages those long distances. In the case of Japan, it's been necessary for us to contract with a can manufacturer to actually make the specific can sizes we are using in Japan, as they're not otherwise available. And at the same time, we are working with 2 production facilities to qualify them to run those cans for us. And so, it is taking some time, but we're making good progress in that regard, particularly in the light of the -- that being the largest volume area for us in that region. We're, obviously, looking to try and get that production up and running as soon as possible. We're hoping to -- towards the middle of the year to start looking at being able to do a test run and produce. We are also probably a little more behind that in Korea and in India. But in those -- both of those countries, it may be easier to get cans less complicated because of the fact that we do have and can buy certain cans in those countries, but those will probably be a little behind that. And so, we're working on all 3 fronts, but the -- our focus is on Japan because of the larger volumes that we are doing in that country. We are also in the process this week of launching Absolutely Zero, which is a new line extension in Japan. So we are looking positively to Japan going through the rest of the year.
Sarah Miller: Okay. And then, my one follow-up question is, I remember, with Europe last year, it was pretty cold and pretty wet through the spring and summer. I'm just wondering if you have kind of an estimate of how weather might have helped you in the EMEA region this quarter and what your comps look like for the rest of the year?
Rodney C. Sacks: We -- I'm not sure that weather has had a material impact. I think the weather hasn't been great this first quarter as well in Europe. They had some pretty cold spells until recently, particularly in Great Britain. So I just don't think that will have an impact. I think there was just -- there has been a little bit of a general slowing. Again -- but I think that the month of April was probably a little slower for us in Europe than the first quarter, but we believe that will improve as we -- going into the remainder of the quarter. But again, it's still too early to tell. I mean, there's nothing I can give you specifically on those numbers and directions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Caroline Levy of CLSA.
Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: I wonder if you could tell us -- it looks to us, like, net sales were only up a couple of percent in the U.S. and about 30 overseas. If you could help me understand if I'm on the right track with that and also, will the professional fees will probably run at a similar rate through the year from where you sit today?
Rodney C. Sacks: Your estimate is pretty close on the numbers. I think that on -- that's on the sales side. On the professional fees, we're not sure. It depends on a number of factors. We think that if the FDA has its scientific hearing and things, sort of, start becoming a little clearer, I think a lot of things will clear up and I think a lot of the -- there may be a falloff in the professional fees. It's -- we've had to deal with a number of challenges from different quarters. And that's just [indiscernible] the engagement of a lot of lawyers. We've also had to undertake some -- and get some other market research reports and surveys underway in order to, obviously, prepare the company for any challenges and to support our positions, which we are confident in. And those costs are all sort of incurring initially, which we don't think will necessarily be repeated. But it's very difficult to tell how long that will go on for -- I mean, we -- for example, we've engaged with many consultants to, obviously, consult with us on some of the litigious matters, but also to deal with the PR issues, and all of those costs and lobbies [ph] of things that we've not normally dealt within the past, and we believe that will settle out down, and then those costs will settle down a little more than they have been in the first quarter. But again, I just don't know.
Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: And just a follow-up with the -- on the international losses. Could you repeat, I think there was $4.3 million in the last first quarter, what they were this one and why the change?
Rodney C. Sacks: I think it was $2.1 million for this quarter versus $4.3 million. And so, what has happened is that I think that sales have improved. Our costs per case have gone down. But because of the increased sales, you still had a small loss. But the results are improving, and the losses are improving. As we go into the summer, we believe those results will continue to improve.
Operator: Our next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: First, just -- the comment about the April trend being up 5.7%. I know it's not appropriate to really look at 1-month data, but I know you're lapping a 39% comp with the Japan sales. So can you maybe give us a little bit color of that 5.7% U.S. versus international, and how much of the drag the pipeline fell last year when Japan had on that number?
Rodney C. Sacks: Well, Japan clearly had an effect on it because we were selling into Japan prior to our launch there. So that is the one -- clearly, the one issue, Judy, which you, obviously, have alluded to. In the quarter, all I would like to really say is that the North American numbers are up in that -- in the month compared to the quarter, and the European numbers were slightly down in that month compared to the quarter. And I think that, that was a -- we think that, that is an anomaly in the European numbers. We think they will improve again and pick up in May. But there has been an improving trend in North America in the month.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And that was the -- can you quantify if that's more representative of what we're seeing in the Nielsen data?
Rodney C. Sacks: I'm not keen to go more in detail. I just don't have an exact amount available to you right now. But it is closer to the Nielsen data, I think.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, okay. And then, just -- you've talked about some of the weakness in Canada and Mexico. I mean, they're obviously profitable margins for you within the international markets. So can you talk about what's going on in those markets? And then, if you think about the international margin progression for the rest of the year, just the weakness in Canada and Mexico...
Rodney C. Sacks: Let me just refer to Canada. Canada, towards the end of the quarter -- and in the numbers that I referred to in the Nielsen's, part of that weakness, we believe, is due to the fact that, last year, we introduced and launched Rehab in the same period. So you -- again, you're citing off a period or a comparable period where we had an introduction, and we didn't have any comparable introductory products in Canada in that -- in this year's comparable period. In the case of Mexico, again, a short period is quite affected by the OXXO chain. The OXXO chain comprised a very big proportion of the total market and, again, depending on who is in promotion in [ph] OXXO has quite a material impact. If you looked at the number that we had for the month previously for Mexico, I think we were ahead of Red Bull. And then you look at this month, we are behind Red Bull. And in other words -- and very largely, if not all, but largely attributable to the fact that we were on promotion, I think, earlier in the year in OXXO and in sort of March, April, Red Bull were on promotion. I think March, Red Bull were on promotion. So that affects the numbers quite dramatically in Mexico. So that really accounts for a lot of the detail. So although Canada was down, Mexico has -- is up. There's also has been some price challenge in pricing from Rockstar in -- particularly in Canada where they're being quite aggressive, they've come off their pricing but there has been some pricing challenges in Canada.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then, lastly, just Brazil, can you quantify how much of sales went through Brazil in the first quarter? And then, maybe if you can you broadly talk about what you're seeing with your partnership with Ambev, how much of the improvement do you expect to see as you continue....
Rodney C. Sacks: You've got less than 5 weeks of sales within the quarter under the Ambev stewardship. But what we are seeing is that we're getting -- it's a large organization. We're getting a large sales force behind the brand. We're getting substantial, additional new listings every week. And so, we are seeing it in that way. We're seeing the momentum, and we're seeing it's sort of coming. And so, we are very positive about it. But the actual effect in the quarter was not that much, it's only 5 weeks of sales. Try -- the sales initially trending before we switched. There's a part, I don't know, we're lower than last year and then there was pickup once we switched, and we ended up with about -- just under $1 million in additional sales. But again, it's not an easy comparison because we did -- we were trending lower, and we went through a difficult period once we were actually undergoing the switch off to when we announced the deal. But we're definitely seeing improved numbers of outlets selling and the actual volume going into Ambev from us. And that's continuing through April.
Operator: Our final question of the hour comes from Wendy Nicholson of Citi Research.
Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Two questions. First, just following up on the international profitability, can you give us a sense sort of directionally how big of a gap the gross margin for the international business is for the -- compared to the U.S. business? In other words, assuming the international business continues to outgrow the U.S., how is the gross margin pressure going to continue to be an ongoing impact?
Rodney C. Sacks: Yes, it will be. We think if the margins are closer to the 40% level, where the North American margins are north of 50%. So there is a differential.
Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Got it. Okay. And then, just second question, with the sort of prolonged potential slowdown in the category -- I know part of what's driven the category growth over the last few years has been increased sort of a linear shelf space at a lot of convenience stores and other retailers in the U.S. Do you see any of the stores talking about now going the other way and taking shelf space away from the energy drink category and giving it back to other sectors of the LRB market, or is that static at this point?
Rodney C. Sacks: We don't see that. We see this category as still being profitable for retailers. We still see better growth in this category than in the other -- in other categories with better margins and better dollar rings -- substantially, better dollar rings per SKU. So we see no reason for retailers to restrict the space. On the contrary, we think that, in fact, space is continuing to expand. If you want, for example, to go look at the space being allocated last year and this year and going forward at -- like Wal-Mart, which is pretty much the biggest retailer in the country, you will see that they're allocating, we believe, more space to energy, and we believe that will continue. We believe there has been a dampening of the category due to all of the media and publicity. But we think that, that is the major factor that has been affecting the category. We believe that, that will eventually start becoming, and indeed we are starting to see less and less impact of that, as consumers just continue to see the same stories being repeated over and over in different ways but without really having any real substance to them, and we believe that eventually, that we'll be able to overcome that and that the growth will resume. But it has taken a toll in the meantime.
Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: But is it fair to say that, in the near term, your promotional spend are going to be -- I see it's gone up a fair bit in the first quarter. But is it fair to assume that you'll continue to spend more not only because of Red Bull being a little bit more competitive, but to offset some of those, sort of, whatever PR headwinds that you're facing?
Rodney C. Sacks: I don't think so. I think the -- those sort of headwinds are headwinds. I don't think that's going to change the way we spend. I think that, just on the spending side, we're obviously going to look at our spending. Our spending -- increase in spending as a proportion of CMAs [ph] and allowances is very much in line with last year. We think we're going to continue within that range. Where we did have additional spending is in the marketing and size. Obviously, we anticipated -- we felt that our increase would be higher than in fact, it has been -- come through in the first quarter. So we're going to look at where we can, obviously, address this upfront and balance our expenses a little more carefully. But other than that, I don't think we're going to change the way we're doing business. We think that it is a near-term headwind. And we think that it will ultimately settle down and normalize again. And when it normalizes, we believe we will be able to see additional growth resume. But obviously, we are looking to try and manage our expense lines a little better and to try to improve our bottom line going forward.
Operator: And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Sacks for any closing remarks.
Rodney C. Sacks: Thank you. On behalf of Monster, I would like to thank everyone for their continued support for the company. We remain confident in the safety of our products and our growth strategy and are committed to developing and differentiating our brands and expanding the Monster brand, both domestically and internationally. Again, we reiterate that our products are safe and are properly labeled. The caffeine content in Monster Energy is approximately 10 milligrams per ounce, which is less than half the milligrams per ounce of caffeine contained in coffeehouse brewed coffee. I cannot continue to underemphasize that point, which is -- which are the facts. And the naysayers just continue to ignore the facts, and we need to stick to the facts. And we believe that, ultimately, we will get through the headwinds we have encountered in recent months. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you, sir, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation. That does conclude Monster Beverage Corporation's First Quarter 2013 Financial Results Call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Corporation Fourth Quarter and Year End 2012 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Rodney C. Sacks: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me, as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 29, 2012, and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed on November 9, 2012, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated February 27, 2013. A copy of this information is also available on our website www.monsterbevcorp.com, in the Financial Information section. Once again, we reiterate that our products are safe based on both our and the industry's long track record and the scientific evidence supporting the safety of our ingredients. We estimate that about 50 billion cans of energy drinks have been sold and safely consumed worldwide over the past 25 years, including more than 8 billion Monster Energy drinks over the past 11 years. Based on a third-party report, it is estimated that Red Bull sold more than 5 billion cans of energy drinks in 165 countries in 2012. In 2012, we sold some 2 billion-plus cans of Monster Energy drinks in approximately 90 countries. To the best of our knowledge, the FDA's position is that it continues to believe that there is a long history of safe use of products containing caffeine in the U.S., and that the average amount of caffeine consumed by the U.S. population has not increased in spite of the entry of energy drinks into the marketplace. The FDA has confirmed that available studies do not indicate any new previously unknown risks associated with caffeine consumption. Unfortunately, inaccurate and speculative articles continue to be published in the media regarding energy drinks. We have endeavored to respond to those inaccuracies when practical by providing accurate and scientific facts to the media as has the American Beverage Association. By way of illustration, we compare the caffeine levels in Monster Energy drinks from all sources to the caffeine levels of coffeehouse coffee, such as for example Starbucks or Caribou, as this comparison is more easily understood by and meaningful to consumers. Coffee has been and continues to be extensively and safely consumed everyday in the U.S. by many tens of millions of consumers. Some publications have erroneously suggested that energy drinks contain up to 500 milligrams of caffeine and have compared them to a 5-ounce cup of coffee that contains about 100 milligrams of caffeine. Monster Energy drinks do not contain anywhere near 500 milligrams of caffeine. A 16-ounce Monster Energy drink contains approximately 160 milligrams of caffeine. We do not believe that any of the leading coffeehouses sell 5-ounce cups of coffee, including Starbucks. A small Starbucks contains 12 ounces of coffee, a medium-sized Starbucks contains 16 ounces of coffee, and its large size, 20 ounces. While Starbucks also sells an 8-ounce size, we believe the size has very limited sales. We note that Starbucks also sells an extra large 31-ounce size. In making a comparison to coffee, we believe that it is appropriate to use Starbucks' 16-ounce medium-size coffee, which is the same size as a regular 16-ounce Monster Energy drink. Starbucks' 16-ounce coffee contains approximately 330 milligrams of caffeine, which is double the approximate 160 milligrams of caffeine in the same size Monster Energy drink and a 16-ounce Caribou coffee contains between 305 and 370 milligrams of caffeine. Some have criticized our comparison on the ground that coffee is bitter, hot and consumed by adults. These criticisms are misplaced. Coffeehouses provide free sugar and cream. A significant number of items listed on their menus are sweet and indulgent and available hot and cold. Adolescents do in fact, drink coffee extensively. One only needs to visit Starbucks, Caribou or any other coffeehouse store to confirm this. It is estimated that around 350 million cups of coffee are drunk every day in the U.S., equates to about 128 billion cups per year. According to a study done by the research firm NPD, some 13% of coffee consumers are under 18. That translates to about 45 million cups of coffee that are drunk everyday by teenagers under 18 or approximately 17 billion cups per year. We estimate that the size of the energy drink market in the U.S. is about 5 billion cans a year. In other words, the coffee market is about 25x bigger than the energy drink market. Even if one were to consume -- were to assume that a higher percentage of teenagers under 18 consume energy drinks than coffee, which we do not believe is accurate, coffee consumption in the U.S. by teens under 18 is dramatically higher than energy drinks. The National Coffee Association of the USA in its 2012 national coffee drinks -- drinkers trends advise that more than 50% of coffee drinkers said they began drinking coffee at least once a week between the ages of 13 and 19. We also do not accept that consumers tend to drink coffee more slowly than energy drinks, which has also been suggested. On the contrary, coffee cools quickly and consumers generally prefer to drink their coffee before it becomes lukewarm. Additionally, a large percentage of coffeehouse coffees are not consumed hot and are positioned as cold drinks, i.e., Frappuccino, iced coffee, mochas, et cetera. As an aside, the caffeine levels of coffeehouse coffees, which are generally double that of energy drinks are also not listed on menu boards or cups. Even McDonald's, one of the largest restaurant chains in the U.S., has been remodeling their stores to provide coffee drinks, both hot and cold, in many flavors, varieties and efficacy. Monster Energy drinks have traditionally been marketed as dietary supplements as defined under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. However, as communicated in the past, Monster Energy drinks could also be marketed as conventional beverages because their ingredients are either FDA-approved food or color additives or substances that are Generally Recognized As Safe or GRAS at the levels used in the products. We confirm that the company has made the decision to transition its Monster Energy drinks to conventional foods for a number of business reasons, including: To eliminate our competitive disadvantage in certain states, where energy drinks labeled as conventional food, like Red Bull, are exempt from sales tax and are also eligible for redemption with food stamps, while energy drinks labeled as dietary supplements like Monster are not. This change will have the effect of leveling the playing field with our major competitors. The company saw no reason to continue being subjected to the erroneous and misguided criticism that its Monster Energy drinks are being marketed as dietary supplements to avoid FDA regulation. As we have always said, dietary supplements are subject to as much if not more FDA oversight than are conventional foods and Monster Energy drinks could equally satisfy the regulatory requirements applicable to both regulatory categories. Finally, we recently joined the American Beverage Association and will follow their recommendations to label energy drinks as conventional foods and to list the caffeine amounts on labels. The change will be put into effect as and when new packaging is manufactured and new products are introduced. The ingredients currently in Monster Energy drinks will continue to be included in those drinks in the future, save for some inconsequential changes in minor products. Following completion of this labeling change, we anticipate that only our Worx Energy products, which are packaged in 2-ounce bottles, will continue to be labeled as dietary supplements in accordance with the FDA regulations. Discovery is continuing in the Fournier case. This is a very sad situation for the family, and we sympathize with them. However, the production of additional medical records and documents continues to confirm that there was no causal connection between Ms. Fournier's alleged consumption of a Monster Energy drink and her death. In addition to Ms. Fournier's serious hereditary heart condition, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, she also suffered from other significant structural defects of her heart, including mitral valve prolapse, fibrosis and myocarditis. Heart defects of these types are commonly known to cause cardiac arrest and sudden death. It is believed that these conditions, either independently or in concert with one another, caused her arrhythmia and ultimately her sad and untimely death. Caffeine does not appear to have been in any way connected with or the cause of Ms. Fournier's arrhythmia and cardiac arrest. Indeed, we believe that Ms. Fournier was accustomed to drinking a cup of coffee every morning. Again, we point out that no caffeine blood level test was ever performed, and there is no scientific evidence of the level of caffeine in Ms. Fournier's system at the time of her cardiac arrest, if any. We repeat that the levels of caffeine contained in our Monster Energy drinks are safe. On December 20, 2012, the company responded to the letter received by it on October 31, 2012, from the City Attorney of San Francisco questioning the safety of our energy products and the marketing claims made by the company with respect thereto. On February 8, the company responded to the letter received by the company from Senators Durbin and Blumenthal and Representative Markey regarding the safety, labeling and marketing of the energy drink products sold by the company. In both responses, we provided citations to numerous examples of third-party scientific documentation substantiating the safety of our products. As we have previously stated, we will continue to provide appropriate responses to any regulatory or similar inquiries that we receive. The company has also received miscellaneous demands and/or complaints over the past few months regarding the labeling and/or safety of our energy drink product from various unscrupulous plaintiff's lawyers, and which the company believes to be without substance. The company intends to vigorously defend against those claims. The company assumes no obligation to update any statements made with respect to ongoing litigation and regulatory matters, including with respect to the afore-going disclosures, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, other than as required by law. Given the current litigation and pending regulatory requests, I hope you understand that we will refrain from answering questions or commenting further on these specific subjects. We are happy, of course, to answer questions you may have about our products in general or about our fourth quarter results as best we can after we have concluded our discussion on the business. Let me now turn to a discussion on the business. We believe that the softness in the energy drink market in the U.S. over the past few months may be due in part to the ongoing negative publicity and comments that continue to appear in the media questioning the safety of energy drinks and suggesting limitations on their ingredients, including caffeine and/or the levels thereof and/or imposing minimum age restrictions for consumers. In the face of these challenges, the company nevertheless continued to make good progress in the fourth quarter and achieved record fourth quarter gross sales, up 16.6% to $545 million, net sales up 15% to $471.5 million and operating income up 10.1% to $113.9 million. Our tax rate was higher this quarter at 39.1% versus 38.3% in the same quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share increased 10.6%, from $0.35 per share in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $0.39 per share in the fourth quarter of 2012. While we are pleased with the results we achieved in the fourth quarter, our revenues were somewhat affected by less robust growth for the energy category as a whole and Monster Energy in our principal market, the United States, particularly in the latter half of the quarter. Lower sales of certain of our energy drinks, primarily our Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology energy drinks and Worx Energy shots and flat sales in our Warehouse division. As discussed on previous conference calls, we will be reporting on Nielsen's extended sample of outlets, which includes Wal-Mart; dollar stores such as Family Dollar, Dollar General and Fred's; DeCA military stores; and club stores, namely Sam's and BJ's, but excluding Costco. According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through February 16, 2013, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, on the expanded basis I just described, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including shots, increased by 5.7% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 8.1% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 10.8%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 4.1% and sales of 5-Hour decreased by 7.7%. Sales of AMP were down 17.6%. NOS increased 11.7% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 2.3%. According to the Nielsen report for the 4 weeks ended February 16, 2013, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel, in dollars, increased by 3.8% over the comparable 4-week period in 2012. Sales of Monster increased by 7.5% over the comparable period last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 7.2% over the same period. Rockstar was up 4.4%, while 5-Hour was down 9.5%. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended February 16, 2013, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 1.1 points over the comparable period a year ago to 31.9% against Red Bull's share of 34.9%, Rockstar's share of 8.5% and 5-Hour's share of 10.6%. According to Nielsen in the 13 weeks ended February 16, 2013, for all outlets combined, sales of energy plus coffee drinks, in dollars, increased 11.7% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 18.6% higher than in the comparable period last year, while Starbucks Double Shot Energy was up 7.4%. Sales of Java Monster exceed -- exceeded sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy drinks. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended January 12, 2013, the energy drink category grew 1%. Monster sales increased 8%, and our market share at 26.4% increased 1.8 points over the comparable period last year. While Red Bull sales increased 2%, and its market share increased 0.5 point to 37.9%. Rockstar sales decreased 6%, and its market share decreased 1 point to 14%. According to Nielsen in the 4 weeks ended January 12, 2013, sales of energy drinks in Canada for the convenience and gas channel grew 2%. Over this period, sales of Red Bull increased 6%, sales of Monster increased 12%, while sales of Rockstar decreased by 12%. According to Nielsen, in all outlets combined in Mexico for the month of December 2012, the energy drink category grew 5.1%. Monster sales increased 11.9%, and our market share increased 2.1 points over the comparable period last year to 35%, while Red Bull sales decreased 2.8%, and its market share decreased 2.8 points to 34.2%. Boost sales increased 26.4%, and its market share increased 2.4 points to 14.5%. Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 15.7% to $451 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2012, from $389.8 million in the same period in 2011 and operating income for the company's DSD segment increased 12.4% from $129.6 million to $145.6 million. Sales of our Monster Original green energy drink continued to grow in the quarter as did sales of Java Monster. However, the increase in sales of these products was partially offset by lower sales of certain Monster SKUs, including our Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology line, which was repositioned from 12-ounce cap-cans to 12-ounce sleek flat top cans and was priced in line with our regular 16-ounce drinks beginning September 2012. It will take some time for the effect of such repositioning to be realized. Sales of Worx were also substantially lower in the fourth quarter than in the same period last year. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment increased 1.9% to $20.5 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2012 due to increased sales of Hubert's Lemonades, but which was partially offset by reduced sales of apple juice. The Warehouse division experienced an operational loss of $320,000 in this quarter compared to an operating income of $750,000 for the same quarter last year, largely as a result of lower gross profit due to the impact of increased costs of apple juice concentrate and higher distribution and selling expenses. For the 3 months ended December 31, 2012, gross sales to retail, grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 3% of gross sales, down from 4% in the comparable period in 2011. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 9% of sales, the same as in the comparable period in 2011. Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 65% of sales, down from 66% in the comparable period in 2011. Gross sales internationally increased to 21% from 19% in the same period in 2011. Other sales were 2% for the period, which was the same as the comparable period last year. Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the fourth quarter of 2012 amounted to $115.2 million compared to $88.9 million in the same quarter in 2011. Included in such sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the fourth quarter of 2012, in dollars, were 27.1% higher than in the same period last year. Excluding the effect of the strengthening dollar, such sales would have been 31.7% higher. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and market share in Europe. In particular in the U.K., Spain, Germany, Benelux and South Africa, Monster achieved substantial sales gains, as well as substantially increased its market share. In the United Kingdom, according to Nielsen, Monster's market share is now approximately 10%. Overall, our Western European and African operations are now operating well, and we have generally made good strides in increasing distribution levels and sales. The Central and Eastern European region is still incurring operating losses, although we are continuing to see improving benefits from the strategic changes we began to implement last year. The launch of Monster Zero Ultra in 16-ounce cans in the third quarter of 2012 was very successful. We continue to believe in our growth strategy, particularly internationally, including entering new markets in which the company's products are not yet being sold. We launched Monster Energy in Slovenia, Peru, Chile, Korea and Singapore in the fourth quarter of 2012 and beginning of 2013, and are continuing with our plans to launch Monster in India, Romania, Albania and Croatia and in additional countries in Central and Eastern Europe later in 2013. We are reevaluating if and when to launch Monster Energy in Argentina in light of the low value chain available in that country for energy drinks. Additional positive news is that the sales in Japan in the fourth quarter of 2012 continue to exceed our expectations. Although damages and resulting product losses in relation to the production and shipping of products for Korea and Japan were substantially reduced in the fourth quarter, such losses still negatively affected our gross margins during the quarter. Our strategy to secure local production in certain of our international markets will help us improve gross margins, mitigate the effects of exchange rate fluctuations, as well as reduce damages. Sales of Peace Tea ready-to-drink iced tea continue to progress well. In the fourth quarter of 2012, gross sales of Peace Tea increased 10.8% over the same period in 2011. We are continuing with our plan to introduce additional packages and container sizes for the Peace Tea brand during the first half of 2013, and in fact, introduced new take-home multipacks of Peace Tea containing 8.4-ounce cans during the first quarter of 2013. We are continuing to sell and market Worx Energy shots, although we have continued to experience a substantial drop-off in sales in this product line. Although we still have a long way to go, we achieved reduced operating losses in Australia in the fourth quarter as compared to the same quarter last year. We have entered into a distribution agreement with Ambev for the distribution of Monster Energy drinks in Brazil. Ambev commenced selling our products at the end of January 2013. We recorded a distributor termination expense of $0.9 million in the quarter following the termination of our previous distributor in Brazil. Gross profit margins achieved in the fourth quarter of 2012 were 51.7% versus 52.3% in the comparable quarter in 2011. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to geographic mix, product and production variances and product damages, primarily in Europe and Asia, including production cost increases passed on to us by our co-factory in the United Kingdom during the first half of 2012 and increased promotional and other allowances as a percentage of net sales. Gross profit margins achieved in North America overall were higher than in the comparable quarter last year. Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales were 4.7% and 4.4% in the fourth quarters of 2012 and 2011, respectively. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.5% for both the 2012 and 2011 fourth quarters. For the fourth quarter of 2012, selling expenses included increases in sponsorship and endorsements, trade development programs, marketing fees and merchandise displays. These increases were partially offset by decreases in commissions and royalty payments paid to noncustomers, premiums and advertising in the fourth quarter of 2012 as compared to the same quarter in 2011. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2012, selling expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 11.9% from 12.9% in 2011. Sponsorship and endorsement costs and allocated trade development programs were higher than in 2011. Selling expenses were also higher due to increased marketing fees and merchandise display costs. The increase in selling expenses was partially offset by reduced selling expenses for advertising, commissions and royalty payments paid to noncustomers. General and administrative expenses increased 17.6% in the quarter. The increase in general and administrative cost was partially attributable to increased professional services, including legal and payroll expenses, which includes stock-based compensation expense. Stock-based compensation expense were $6.8 million for the quarter compared to $6.6 million for the same period last year, and $28.4 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2012, compared to $19.4 million for the 12-month period last year. In 2012, cost of goods in Western Europe were higher on a per case basis, while selling, general and administrative expenses were lower on a per case basis in local currencies than in 2011. We invested extensively in Central and Eastern Europe in 2012, particularly in newer markets throughout the region. Selling, general and administrative expenses in that region were lower on a per case basis in local currencies. We have successfully concluded agreements with our principal distributor in Central and Eastern Europe, which will result in a more equitable allocation of the value chain between us. As a result, we reduced our operating losses in Central and Eastern Europe in 2012, and we intend to build on those arrangements to continue to reduce operating cost and improve our operating results in 2013. We are continuing to work with our Australian distributor to increase their contribution towards promotional costs going forward and have also reduced our overall cost of goods and operating costs in local currency in that market. We will continue to work towards achieving improved results in Australia in 2013. Operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, from our operations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, South America and Asia. Following the strength of the U.S. dollar, we recorded a foreign-currency loss of $2.7 million for the quarter. Our effective tax rate in the 2012 fourth quarter was 39.1% compared to 38.3% in the 2011 fourth quarter. The increase in the 2012 fourth quarter effective tax rate was primarily the result of increased losses in certain foreign subsidiaries for which there is no tax benefit. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2012, was 38.1% compared to 37.4% for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in effective tax rate for the year was also primarily the result of increased losses in certain foreign subsidiaries for which there is no tax benefit, the establishment of full valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries, as well as a higher effective combined state tax rate. During the 2012 fourth quarter, the company purchased 6.7 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $50.86 per share for a total amount of $339.6 million, this excludes broker commissions. Over the full 2012 year, the company purchased a total of 13.5 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $54.47 per share for a total amount of $737.1 million, also excluding broker commissions. Subsequent to December 31, 2012, the company purchased an additional 300,000 shares of its stock at an average purchase price of $51.99 per share, which exhausted the availability under the current repurchase plan. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $222.5 million compared to $359.3 million at December 31, 2011. Short-term investments were $97 million compared to $411 million at December 31, 2011. Long-term investments decreased from $23.2 million at December 31, 2011 to $21.4 million. Included in short and long-term investments are auction rate securities of $23.2 million. Days outstanding for trade accounts receivables were 39.2 days at December 31, 2012, and 42.4 days at December 31, 2011, compared to 38.7 days at December 30, 2011. Inventories increased to $203.1 million from $155.6 million at December 31, 2011. Average days of inventory was 80 days, which was higher than the 72 days of inventory at December 31, 2011. Following the positive response that we received from consumers to the launch of Zero Ultra, we have decided to launch a new Ultra Blue line extension in the first half of 2013 and to defer the launch of the proposed Ultra Pink line extension for now. We are continuing with our plans to introduce Kona Cappuccino in the first half of this year, as well as a new line of 3, 15-ounce energy shakes called Muscle Monster that will contain 25 grams of protein per can. The Monster mini take-home multipacks containing 8-ounce cans were launched in the first quarter of 2013. Initial reception to those products, as well as the Peace Tea multipacks from both retailers and consumers has been positive. We will be launching an additional Monster Rehab line extension, Pink Lemonade + Tea + Energy during the first quarter of 2013. Gross sales in January 2013 were approximately 9.5% higher than in January 2012. We caution again that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as for example selling days, days in the week in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or be regarded as indicative of results in the full quarter or any future period. In regard to January, we do want to point out that January faced a more difficult prior year comp, which was plus 34% last year. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. North American gross margins remain healthy. Our 2012 fourth quarter gross margins for North America were actually higher than in the comparable 2011 fourth quarter. U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that Monster Energy's growth is still outpacing the growth of the category as a whole. We have entered into a distribution agreement with Big Geyser effective April 1, 2013, for distribution of Monster products in the Greater New York area, which is the second-largest energy drink market in the U.S. We plan to launch exciting new additions to the Monster family. Turning to international markets, we are satisfied with the performance of our international expansion and investment. Our market share continues to increase in almost all of our international markets. International gross sales for 2012 topped $0.5 billion. In 2012, our European business achieved improved operating results. Net sales in euros were up 56% for the year. It is noteworthy that even though the energy drink category has been in existence in Europe for over 25 years, our EMEA markets on average are still experiencing double-digit growth. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended December 29, 2012, our market share in the United Kingdom increased to approximately 10% from 6.8% the previous year. And in the 4 weeks ended December 31, 2012, in Spain, we more than doubled our market share and are now the #2 brand with 18% market share, and in South Africa nearly tripled our market share to 15.2%. According to Nielsen, Monster Energy has the leading market share in value in Mexico. We are excited about our expansion into Asia-Pacific. Monster sales in Japan remain encouraging and are exceeding our expectations. The brand has already achieved an estimated 27% value share of the energy drink market in the modern convenience trade channel, according to internal estimates by our distribution partner. The shipping issues we experienced in 2012 have been significantly reduced. We have launched Monster Energy in Korea, having overcome the product approval and labeling issues we had experienced, and we have achieved authorizations in 3 of the 4 largest modern convenience chains in Korea. We also commenced distribution in Brazil at the end of January with Ambev, our new distribution partner. I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala of UBS.
Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I know you're happy with the successes of Zero Ultra, can you talk a little bit about the incrementality of the product? And maybe how much is cannibalizing Lo-Carb or Absolute Zero or maybe even green can?
Rodney C. Sacks: I think that -- we don't think that it's cannibalizing the green can, let's start off with that. That is still up nicely. And that is the largest product, so that is up quite nicely. We have seen some cannibalization against basically the Lo-Carb and our Absolute Zero. We are seeing some cannibalization against those 2 products, that is to be expected. They're all basically playing in that 0 or low-carb category. The actual sales we saw, we reached about 72% distribution in convenience. We still have some distribution to gain, and we think also quality of distribution. In some cases, it's been squeezed onto shelves, so we think that there is some room for expansion in both numbers and quality. And it is already pretty much our second best-selling SKU on a per point basis in the stores it's in. So it has been very, very successful.
Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And just quickly to make sure I understood, you said green can was up. Did you give a number? Did you say it was up strongly? I don't have that number.
Rodney C. Sacks: Let me give a number, it's up 4.4% in the 13 weeks.
Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, got it. And then the last thing on shots, this is your second go-around on the shots business. Sounds like it's down substantially. It also seems like it's a very different consumer that drinks -- that uses shots versus the energy drink consumers. Is it a category that maybe just doesn't fit the profile of your playbook or is it something that you feel that over time has a place...
Rodney C. Sacks: We don't know. We know that there is a category there. We know that it has slowed. But there definitely is -- a category exists. It is a category, in which the basically the only player is still earning very good margins. We believe it is a slightly different consumer, but it does -- a demographic, but it does -- it is related. We're in the beverage category. We believe there still is business. We believe there is room for a competitor, but so far nobody's been able to really crack the code. But it doesn't mean we shouldn't continue trying whether it's in -- with Worx in its present form, its present flavors, its present size, its present pricing. I think we're going to continue to look at and evaluate, but we do believe there is still some opportunity that as a beverage company, we shouldn't walk away from and take off the table. But it does have an effect obviously in looking at comps, and that's why we break it out and deal with it. But we still haven't made final decisions on what to do exactly with Worx or what direction to take in that category.
Operator: Our next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Rodney and Hilton, first just in international market, so fourth quarter slowed down a little bit if I look at your sales growth x currency. So maybe can you talk about some of the markets where you saw a little bit of a softness or is this just really more of a shipment versus kind of a consumer takeaway volatility issue? And from a profitability perspective, it sounds like you are pretty much breakeven in the fourth quarter in your international market. So do you think we're close to now at an inflection point where all of your international markets collectively start to turn profitable?
Rodney C. Sacks: I think that one of the things that did negatively effect our sales in Europe was that CCE in particular went through a realignment of some of their inventories, which decreased, I think, purchases that would ordinarily have been expected from them. And I think -- we think that had a little bit of a dampening effect. I don't want to go into each of the countries. I don't have them handy as to what we did in each of them. We did highlight the major countries, in which we did experience good growth, and those are the main markets in Europe, which is, I think, just about everywhere I think we've grown. I mean, there may be 1 or 2 anomalies, but some of them are -- we still grew. We may not have grown in sell-in, but we did grow in sell-through, but those are the small markets, and they sort of just -- it's just a question of timing. So basically, the main markets, we continue to grow quite nicely, which is the U.K., Germany, Spain, South Africa, Benelux, were good markets this year as well.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Then just in terms of profitability, 2-part question, one, can you talk about Brazil and how the launch in Brazil could impact your profitability in your international markets? Presumably, those are a more profitable market than perhaps some of your other markets. And I believe you said 9.5% in January sales, but you started to ship into Brazil at the end of January. So can you broadly talk about kind of Brazil and how you think that, that market will contribute to your international business in 2013?
Rodney C. Sacks: I'm not sure -- while we began to ship to Ambev, also there was transfer of existing inventories, I think, from our existing distributor to Ambev, so I'm not sure what the net incremental sales were. But the initial response from Ambev has been positive. We're positive. They are a powerful organization. They have extensive distribution. It is rolling out on a sort of a gradual basis, in a region by region basis. It wasn't an immediate hit right through Brazil. But we do believe that there is good growth potential in Brazil. We also believe that while we are continuing to pack our product at an independent third-party packer, we are -- we don't get the benefit of a number of tax breaks and other things. Some of those benefits we believe we will be able to achieve and improve our margins as we realign our packaging with Ambev and take other steps to improve our margins. So we are quite happy. The value chain is acceptable. The value chain, particularly in some of the -- most of the other South American countries we've gone into has also -- has also been quite positive for us. And we will basically -- we will anticipate some costs of trade, MDF slotting, et cetera, as we continue to list product in basically chains in Brazil. We really didn't have very extensive distribution before. So we do look at some upside coming from the South American region. Once we get some of the costs in local production going in Japan and Korea particularly, we do believe those countries will also start contributing profitably. So I think that overall, we were slightly negative on international. But we are looking forward this year to turning the corner. But again, there's a big mix of international that goes into that whole pot, and I can't be more definite than that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Caroline Levy of CLSA.
Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Just I was wondering if you could help us understand proportionately the makeup of the international sales. I mean, Mexico and Canada both in there if I'm not mistaken. Are they the lion's share or is the U.K., Europe, just helping us really understand that.
Rodney C. Sacks: I can try and get some of those sort of totals. Europe is -- overall is clearly far bigger. But I don't -- I'll try and get some of the information to give you some idea of that breakup, while I'm talking and come back to that.
Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: That sounds great. In that context, I was just wondering if the margins in Mexico and Canada are much closer to the U.S. And that it's the all other dragging it down or was Europe getting toward -- just to understand how the time in each market leads to margin expansion over time.
Rodney C. Sacks: We think the margins in Canada are certainly more closely aligned to the U.S. and Mexico's a little lower. But also still reasonably aligned to the U.S. Europe has sort of pretty decent margins. Asia-Pacific is where we are suffering from low margins at this point in time, and we believe that will be -- start being corrected as we go forward operationally. And in South America sort of in between, but again, we hope that we'll be able to improve margins in South America as in when we start producing with Ambev in Brazil and also in other regions in South America. In the dollars, while -- if you look at the U.K., as an individual country the U.K. is our biggest country after the U.S. It's larger than Canada or Mexico. And Spain, basically in the quarter, Spain, Japan, South Africa, Australia and Germany are the next largest, and they are reasonably close to each other after that.
Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Oh, interesting.
Rodney C. Sacks: Just to give you a sort of order of how it goes.
Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Sorry?
Rodney C. Sacks: To give you an order of how they're sort of coming in dollar terms sales.
Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: May I also just clarify, you said sales were up 9.5% lapping 32%. What were you referring to in that number in January?
Rodney C. Sacks: I was referring to the increase last year, January over the January the year before.
Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Is this U.S. Nielsen data?
Hilton H. Schlosberg: It's our sales.
Rodney C. Sacks: No. It's our sales.
Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: And does it include international?
Hilton H. Schlosberg: Yes.
Rodney C. Sacks: Yes. This is growth.
Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Growth, yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Chappell of SunTrust.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Looking at the U.S. market over the, I guess, the past few months, it's not that you've been losing a ton of share, but it seems like Red Bull has been gaining more than most. And just trying to see if you look at that, is that coming the Red Bull, from space jump and better marketing or do you think they haven't been quite as tainted by some of the negative press as you have? And was that something you think that will continue or is it just more of a short term?
Rodney C. Sacks: I think what happened was, you saw initially I think the negative press seemed to have been directed sort of focused more on our brand as opposed to the category. And then more recent times, it's becoming a whole category issue. So we think that was probably one factor. We also think if you look at the individual sales, what has happened in Red Bull is they've really -- what has happened, the one package that has grown for them has been their 12-ounce package, which has become their leading package, and that's where they've seen quite a big bump and basically based on not so much -- not on units, but on value because they really were trading up from a 8-ounce size at $2 to a 12-ounce size at $2.49 or whatever it is, or $2.90 or whatever the price is. The average price of their -- I'll give you the 2, the pricing from $2.17 up to the average price of $2.89. So that's largely where they have picked up and continued to pick up market share in dollar terms. That's accounted for that. They've also we think -- what we've seen is substantially a substantial pick up in marketing, not only in the U.S., but around the world. And that clearly also has probably had some effect on their sales.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: And is that something you need to react to or you feel very comfortable with...
Rodney C. Sacks: A lot of that is -- a lot of it is when you time your marketing programs. We're looking at the markets, they've executed very well in the markets. That's an issue which I think we need to get our distribution partners to perhaps step up their distribution capabilities and the presence on shelf. They are executing very well in store, which is important. And then I think if you do look at the last 4 weeks, we've sort of tended to catch up and we've now -- we're actually slightly ahead of them in convenience. I think it's going to be growth in convenience and gas. So it will take -- it will start catching up and then I think as we sort of start to get into our promotional cycle, we think things will improve. They did introduce some line extensions also during the period through one of their -- they had exclusive I think on some line extensions with 7-Eleven, but what our experience has been overseas that those line extensions ultimately haven't been particularly incremental. But we don't know how they will ultimately pan out in the U.S. Again, we think that, that won't be a driver going forward for them, but they overall have improved their share.
Operator: Our last question will come from Mark Astrachan of Stifel.
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: A couple of housekeeping questions. What were Rehab sales in the quarter? Japan, Korea cost in the quarter? How does that compare to the magnitude of the cost that you incurred there in the second and third quarter?
Rodney C. Sacks: Rehab was a little bit difficult. We've seen some softness in some of the Rehab SKUs. We haven't been able to really get fully under the numbers because last year, we did have the line extensions, which went into -- were listed in the fourth quarter. So there was clearly some sell-in and then -- it's really just been difficult to really compare them. There has been a mixed bag of up and down and that effect. We also think there is possibly some seasonality that is starting to show up more in the Rehab line more than perhaps our other lines because of the fact that it is a tea and it's a non-carbonated tea product. So we think that there also has been some seasonality impact. Can you repeat your second question to us?
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Yes, the second question one is the cost incurred for the rollout in Japan and Korea in the fourth quarter, were they of similar magnitude to what you incurred in the second and third quarter? And then just a follow-up to the Rehab, do you have a net sales number overall? Were Rehab sales up in the fourth quarter on your the reported numbers, not the scanner data?
Rodney C. Sacks: Retail sales on gross dollars are not up in the fourth quarter of '12 versus '11. They are down somewhat. But again, we've not really been able to tell with any real certainty how we've taken out the effect -- to back out the effect of the sell-in. We believe that if you'd back out the effect for sell-in, there's not much difference. But again, that's something we just haven't been able to get fully into. On the costs, I'm not sure I'm able to give you an answer on the phone on the costs in Asia, fourth quarter versus the third at this point. I think it's just -- I just don't have them handy.
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: All right, fine. Just lastly then on share repurchase, so is this something that we need to wait for the board to convene to re-up another authorization or is there something you want to talk about regarding that?
Rodney C. Sacks: This is -- we really have no -- we cannot give you any update. This is something that we're going to -- we'll put on the agenda. We have a board meeting on Friday. We'll put it on -- have it on the agenda. But we're not sure what we want to at this point in time. And just really hard for me to speculate now as to whether we'll introduce an additional program, certainly immediately we've just spent a lot of money expanding, so we may relook at it. But we will evaluate at the board meeting on Friday.
Operator: And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back to management for any further remarks.
Rodney C. Sacks: On behalf of Monster I would like to thank each of you for your continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in our growth strategy, and we remain committed to developing and differentiating our brands and to expanding the company at home and abroad. We reiterate that our products are safe, are properly labeled, and that the caffeine content in a Monster Energy drink at approximately 10 milligrams per ounce is less than half the milligrams per ounce of caffeine contained in Starbucks and other coffeehouse brewed coffee. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's presentation. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2012 Q3  (2012-11-08 17:00:00) =====
Executives:  Hilton H. Schlosberg – Vice Chairman, President, COO, CFO and Secretary Rodney C. Sacks - CEO

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Corporation Third Quarter 2012 Financial Results Call. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.  I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Rodney Sacks. You may begin, sir.
Rodney C. Sacks: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President is with me today as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed on February 29, 2012, and our most recent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, including the sections contained therein entitled, Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated August 8, 2012. A copy of this information is also available on our website, at www.monsterbevcorp.com, in the Financial Information section. I’m sure that you’re aware that our company as a result of certain litigation, regulatory requests and media reports, has been the subject of discussion recently. I want to take this opportunity to briefly address this. First and foremost, we reiterate that our products are safe. More than 8 billion cans of Monster Energy drinks have been sold and safely consumed in the United States and around the world since 2002. Additionally, 10 of billions of energy drinks manufactured and distributed not only by us, but by other companies, have been sold and safely consumed worldwide for 25 years.  We believe that consumers are justified based on that long track record in having confidence in the safety of our products. A principal area of attention relates to caffeine. Unfortunately, there has been some misinformation published recently regarding the caffeine content of Monster. So let me give you the facts. Monster energy drinks generally contain approximately 10mg of caffeine per ounce from all sources. By comparison, the leading brands of coffee house brewed coffee, for example Starbucks, contain on average in excess of 20mg of caffeine per ounce. In other words, a 16 ounce can of Monster Energy contains about half the caffeine of a 16 ounce cup of coffeehouse brewed coffee. Even a 24 ounce can of Monster Energy, which contains about 240mg of caffeine from all sources, has about 30% less caffeine than an average medium sized 16 ounce cup of coffeehouse brewed coffee. So again our products are just as safe for consumers as a cup of coffee purchased at your favorite coffee house. Even an extra large size single serving of a Mountain Dew fountain drink which is readily available throughout America contains about 234mg of caffeine. In addition, the amount of caffeine per ounce in other major energy drinks on the market is comparable to or higher than the amount in Monster. There is absolutely no basis for singling out Monster in this regard. Another area of recent media focus has been on the fact that Monster Energy drinks are labeled as dietary supplements rather than as foods. In the case of Monster Energy drinks, this is a red herring. Our products could be labeled and sold as foods if we chose to do so. As previously indicated, Monster Energy drinks, including their ingredients and labeling, comply fully with all laws and regulations in the United States and in each of the more than 70 countries in which they are sold. All of the ingredients contained in our products at current levels are either FDA approved food additives or are GRAS, which stands for Generally Recognized as Safe and are therefore permissible for inclusion in and labeling as foods, As a result, with the Monster Energy drinks are classified as dietary supplements or as a food is a distinction without a difference. Either way, the current ingredients, none of which are secret or hidden, are fully permissible as a food and a supplement. In other words, we are confident that if we chose to do so, we could re-categorize Monster Energy drinks as a food. Apart from minor changes in form, the labels of Monster Energy as a food would be almost precisely the same and contain the same details as currently appear on our cans. In fact, all of our main competitor’s energy drinks with the labeled as foods or supplements, contain similar, if not substantially higher levels of caffeine than do our products. Furthermore, from the time Monster was launched more than 10 years ago, the labels on all Monster Energy drinks have expressly stated that the product should be consumed responsibly and are not recommended for children, people sensitive to caffeine or pregnant women. Finally, there’s also been recent focus on so-called adverse event reports that are filed with the FDA. The FDA itself has stated quite clearly that adverse event reports about a product are not reports issued by the FDA and do not themselves establish any cause or link between a product and the reported event. More specifically, the fact is that the FDA has made it clear that it has not established any cause or link between Monster Energy drinks and any of the handful of events reported in adverse event reports. These reports were received by the FDA over an eight year period between 2004 and 2012 so there are no new or sudden issues. The FDA has long been aware of these reports. It was aware of them, including the report relating to the 14 year old girl whose family brought the lawsuit against Monster when the agency stated publicly in August of this year that it monitors the products it regulates, specifically including energy drinks by examining current scientific data, monitoring new ingredients added to products and investigating reports of adverse effects. The FDA stated its conclusion that the available evidence and I quote, does not indicate any new previously unknown risks associated with caffeine consumption. In short, there is not a shred of information which cause of links Monster to these adverse events and the Fournier lawsuit is the first the company has received alleging a fatality caused by Monster. Nor are we aware of a single instance anywhere in the world in which Monster Energy drinks have cause anyone’s death.  While of course we are saddened by the death of the 14 year old girl whose family brought the lawsuit against the company, the allegations in that lawsuit claiming to the contrary are false and totally baseless and are not supported by either the science or the facts. The autopsy report reveals that a caffeine blood level was not performed and that her death was natural and associated with a preexisting heart condition which by itself increased her risk of cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death. We will defend vigorously the lawsuit.  I hope this clarifies some points that have been made that have been the subject of recent media reports and makes clear our complete confidence in our products. We will of course provide an appropriate response to any regulatory or similar inquiry that we receive. The company can document and support the legal basis by which its products are properly labeled as dietary supplements and also produces adequate third party scientific documentation to substantiate their safety. However, given the current litigation and pending regulatory recourse, I hope you understand that we will refrain from answering questions or commenting further on these specific subjects. We are happy of course to answer questions you may have about our products in general or about third quarter results as best we can after we have concluded our discussion on the business which I will turn to now. While the beverage industry in general continued to experience softness in the third quarter, sales volumes, the energy category in our principal market, the United States, continued to grow in the teens in the third quarter, although slightly lower than the growth rates of the energy category in the US in the second quarter. overall, the company had a good third quarter with record third quarter growth sales, up 15.4% to $632.3 million. Net sales up 14.2% to $541.9 million and operating income up 6.5% to $140.7 million. Our tax rate was higher this quarter at 39% versus 37.2% in the same quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share increased 6.1% from $0.44 per share in the third quarter of 2011 to $0.47 per share.  While we are pleased with the results we achieved this quarter, this can be described as the quarter of the proverbial thousand paper cuffs with less robust growth for the quarter being due in part to less robust growth for the energy category as a whole in the US together with less robust growth for Monster Energy in our US market, particularly in the latter half of the quarter. lower sales in Canada in the quarter largely due to a realignment by Coca Cola Canada of their inventory levels, the strength of the US dollar against certain currencies in our international markets, lower sales of Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology Energy drinks. This product line has been repositioned from 12 ounce cap cans to 12 ounce SLEEK flap top cans and effective September we lowered pricing for the extra strength line in line with our regular 16 ounce Monster Energy drinks, lower sales of Worx Energy Shots and also lower sales in our warehouse division.  Nielsen recently commenced reporting sales information for the United States market based on an expanded sample of outlets, which now includes Wal-Mart, dollar stores such as Family Dollar, Dollar General and Fred’s, DeCA Military Stores and club stores namely Sam’s and BJs, but excluding Costco. On this call and in the future, well at least for the remainder of this year, when we discuss the Nielsen reports for the United States for all outlets combined and the reported information contained in it, will be based on this expanded sample. This will not affect the reported information governing sales in the convenience and gas channel, grocery and or drug channels which might from time to time be referred to individually. We will provide figures on both basis as we only begun referring to reports based on the expanded sample earlier this year. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through October 20, 2012 for all outlets combined, then the convenience grocery, drug and mass merchandisers on the expanded basis I just described, including Wal-Mart, dollar stores, DeCA Military Stores and club stores, but excluding Costco. Sales in dollars in the energy drink category including shops increased 13.3% versus the same period a year ago.  Sales of Monster grew 19.5% in the 13 week period while sales of Red Bull increased by 16.6%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 10.8% and sales of 5-Hour decreased by 1.8%. Sales of Amp were down 8.9%, NOS increased 13.2% off a low base and sales of Full Throttle increased 9.1% For comparative purposes, according to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through October 20, 2012, on the previously reported basis for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, excluding Wal-Mart, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including shots increased 13% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 18.7% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 16.9%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 11.4% and sales of 5-Hour decreased by 1.8%. Sales of Amp were down 10.4%. NOS increased 11.1% off a low base, and sales of Full Throttle increased 6.9%. According to the Nielsen report, for the four weeks ended October 20, 2012, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel in dollars, increased by 10% over the comparable four week period in 2011. Sales of Monster increased by 19% over the comparable period last year, almost twice the growth of the energy drink category in convenience and gas, while sales of Red Bull increased by 12.6% over the same period. Rockstar was up 6.2% while 5-Hour was down 8.4%.  According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended October 20, 2012, Monster’s market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased by 2.5 points over the comparable period a year ago to 33.5%, against Red Bull share of 33%, Rockstar share of 8% and 5-Hour share of 10.5%. According to Nielsen, in the 13 weeks ended October 20, 2012, for all outlets combined, sales of energy plus coffee drinks, in dollars, increased 19% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 23.3% higher than in the comparable period last year and Starbucks Double Shot energy was up 18%. Sales of our noncarbonated Monster Rehab tea plus energy line, according to Nielsen for the 13 weeks ended October 20, 2012, represented approximately 13% of the sales of all Monster beverages sold in the convenience and gas channel. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended September 22, 2012, the energy drink category grew 5%, Monster sales increased 8% and our market share at 26% increased 0.7 points over the comparable period last year, while Red Bull sales increased 7% and its market share increased 0.9 points to 39.6%. Rockstar sales increased 4% and its market share decreased 0.1 point to 34.4%. According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended September 22, 2012, sales of energy drinks in Canada for the convenience and gas channel grew 5%. Over this period, sales of Red Bull increased 8% and sales of Monster increased 9%, while sales of Rockstar increased by 1%. Sales of Monster through our distributor in México in the third quarter of 2012 were 46% higher than in the comparable period last year. Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 15.5% to $516.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2012, from $447.1 million in the same period in 2011. And contribution margin increased 11.1% from $153.1 million to $170.1 million. Net sales for the company's warehouse segment decreased 7% to $25.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2012, compared with $27.6 million for the same period in 2011. And contribution margin decreased to $0.4 million in this quarter versus $2.5 million for the same quarter last year, largely as a result of lower sales – sorry misquoted. It’s $0.04 million in this quarter the contribution margin which is $40,000 versus $2.5 million for the same quarter last year, largely as a result of lower sales and the impact of increased costs of Apple juice concentrate. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately 2% for the three months ended September 30, 2012, which was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain local currencies in which we conduct certain of our international business. This had a negative impact of approximately $12 million on net sales. Sales were also negatively affected by lower sales to Coca Cola refreshments Canada Ltd, our Canadian distributor largely due to the realignment of inventory levels, lower sales of Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology line which we repositioned from 12 ounce cap cans to 12 ounce Sleek flat top cans as I indicated earlier in which effective September 1 were part in line with our regular 16 ounce drinks. Sales of Worx were also lower and net sales of the warehouse division were 7% lower in the quarter than the comparable period last year, primarily due to lower sales of sodas and apple juice which was partially offset by increased sales of Hubert's Lemonades.  For the three months ended September 30, 2012, gross sales through retail, grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 3% of gross sales, down from 4% in the comparable period in 2011. Gross sales through club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 10% of sales, down from 11% in the comparable period in 2011. Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 62% of sales, the same as in the comparable period in 2011. Gross sales internationally increased to 23% from 21% in the same period in 2011. Other sales were 2% for the period, the same as in the comparable period in 2011. Gross sales to customers outside of the United States in the third quarter of 2012 amounted to $144.7 million, compared to $116.8 million in the same quarter in 2011. Included in such sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the third quarter of 2012, in dollars, were 42.6% higher than in the same period last year. Excluding the effect of the strengthening dollar, such net sales would have been 65.4% higher. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and market share in Europe. In particular in the UK, Spain, Germany and the Benelux, Monster achieved substantial sales gains as well as substantially increased its market share. In the United Kingdom, according to Nielsen, Monster’s market share now exceeds 10%. Our European and Africa operations overall, are now operating profitably, particularly South Africa where we have made good strides in increasing distribution levels and sales. The Central and Eastern European region is still incurring operating losses, although we are starting to see the benefits from certain strategic changes which we are implementing. During the quarter we launched Monster Ultra Zero and Cuba Lima in 16 ounce cans and are in the process of launching two new DUB products called Baller’s Blend and Mad Dog in 16 ounce cans. Baller’s Blend was previously positioned as DUB edition in a 550ml size resealable can.  We are continuing with our expansion strategy into new international markets. We launched Monster Energy in the Philippines and Turkey in the third quarter of 2012 and in conjunction with a new distributor, participated in an expanded launch in the Ukraine. We are continuing with our plans to launch Monster in Chile, Peru and Singapore in the next few months and in Argentina and Taiwan in 2013. We’re also planning to launch Monster in additional countries in Central and Eastern Europe in 2013. We believe that we’ve largely overcome product approval and label issues in Korea and anticipate commencing sales there within the few months. Additional positive news is that sales in Japan in the third quarter continued to exceed our expectations. However, we incurred damages of product losses in relation to the production and shipping of products for Korea and Japan which negatively affected our gross margins during the quarter. We are hopeful that the damages in product losses experienced will be materially reduced in the future and are working towards local production. Sales of Peace Tea, ready-to-drink iced teas continue to exceed our expectations. In the third quarter of 2012, gross sales of Peace Tea increased 44.1% over the same period in 2011. We are continuing with our plan to introduce additional packages and container sizes for the Peace Tea brand during the first quarter of 2013. We are continuing to sell in market Worx Energy shots, although we have experienced a substantial drop-off in sales. We have agreed to more favorable terms with our principle distribution partner in central and eastern Europe, Coca Cola Hellenic and are in the process of executing final sign distribution agreements with them to give effected too. Although we still have a long way to go, we achieved improved results in Australia in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2012 through a significant reduction in losses. We are in the midst of reevaluating our strategy in Brazil as we have not been satisfied with Monster’s results achieved there this year and have reached an advanced stage of negotiations with an alternative distributor. Gross profit margins achieved in the third quarter of 2012 were 50.5% versus 52.7% in the comparable quarter in 2011. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to geographic mix, production variances and product damages primarily in Europe and Asia, including production cost increases forced onto us by our partner in the United Kingdom, an increased promotional and other allowances as a percentage of net sales. Gross profit margins achieved in North America overall were marginally lower than in the comparable quarter last year. Although in the United States, they were slightly higher.  Distribution expenses, as a percentage of net sales in the second quarter, were comparable with the same period in 2011. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 11.6% from 12.6% in the same period in 2011. The decrease in selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, was primarily attributable to decreases in advertising, primarily Worx and lower royalties in sales commissions paid to third parties other than customers. The decrease was partially offset by increases in sponsorships, trade development programs and other marketing costs in the third quarter of 2012 as compared to the same quarter in 2011.  As previously reported, we are continuing to invest in the Monster brand internationally, in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, Asia and South America, particularly through trade development programs to supplement our distribution partners' respective sales forces and to service and merchandise the small independent store channel. The cost of product sampling teams and trade development personnel are included as part of our selling expenses and do not form part of our payroll costs. These costs were substantially higher in Europe in the quarter as compared to the US and last year. As distribution improves and the European markets mature, we envisage a reduction in these costs, particularly as a percentage of sales. However, as we continue to enter new markets in Asia and South America, we intend to fund similar trade development programs to establish the Monster brand in those countries. General and administrative expenses increased 23.6% in the quarter. The increase in general and administrative costs was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses and in particular, increased stock-based compensation expense, which was $7.9 million for the quarter compared to $4.9 million last year, and $21.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 compared to $12.9 million for the nine months period last year. For the quarter ended September 30, 2012, operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $2.5 million from our operations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, South America and Asia. This figure was however lower than the $4.5 million losses incurred for the same period last year.  Our effective tax rate in the 2012 third quarter was 59% compared to 37.2% in the 2011 third quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of lower than expected tax benefits from the 2011 domestic production deduction as well as an increase in non-deductible equity compensation.  During the 2012 third quarter the company purchased 6.9 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $57.99 per share for a total amount of $397.5 million, which excludes brokers’ commissions. Subsequent to September 30, 2012 the company purchased an additional 1.9 million shares of its stock at an average purchase price of $54.99 per share which exhausted the availability under the repurchase plan.  Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalence amounted to $283.1 million compared to $359.3 million at December 31, 2011. Short term investments were $307.7 million compared to $411.3 million at December 31, 2011. Long term investments comprised entirely of auction rate securities decreased from $23.2 million at December 31 to $19.9 million.  Days outstanding for credit accounts receivables were 41.3 days at September 30, 2012 and 42.4 days at December 31, 2011 compared to 38.7 days at September 30, 2011.  Our sales outside of the United States continued to increase as a proportion of our overall sales we expect that days outstanding for receivables will increase due to the different terms generally granted to customers internationally in accordance with local practices in their respective countries. Inventories increased to $193.9 million from $155.6 million at December 31, 2011. Average days of inventory were 65 days at September 30, 2012 which was lower than the 71.6 days of inventory at December 31, 2011.  At September 30, 2012 the company held auction rate securities with a face value of $28 million, $44.8 million at December 31, 2011with an amortized cost basis of $20.8 million.  Growth sales in October 2012 were approximately 28% higher than in October 2011. We are encouraged by the strong sales that have been experienced by the company in North America, Western Europe and Japan. We caution again that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors and according to each are not imputed to be or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period.  In conclusion, I’d like to summarize the numerous positive points that occurred during the quarter. The United States gross margins are healthy and are up. 2012 third quarter gross margins for North America were only nominally lower than in the comparable 2011 third quarter. We are satisfied with the performance of our international expansion and investment. Our European business is profitable and the losses we sustained internationally were reduced in the quarter compared to the third quarter of last year.  The U.S. deals and market statistic shows Monster Energy is outpacing the category. Our market share in the important convenience and gas channel in both units and dollars now exceeds that of Red Bull. According to Nielsen, our market share in the United Kingdom has exceeded 10% for the first time. We have reached agreements with Coca Cola Hellenic for a more favorable terms for distribution of our Monster line in certain countries in Central and Eastern Europe. Monster sales in Japan are very encouraging and are exceeding our expectations. We are planning to launch Monster Energy in Korea within the next few months and as we have largely overcome the product approval and label issues that we experienced with our Korean products earlier this year.  Gross sales in 2012, in October 2012 were approximately 28% higher than in October 2011, and we have demonstrated that our products off site are properly labeled and that the caffeine content in the Monster Energy drink at approximately 10 milligrams per ounce is less than half the milligram per ounce of caffeine contained in the Starbuck brewed coffee. I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, (operator instructions). Our first question comes from Judy Hong, with Goldman Sachs.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc: So just in terms of your sales trends. So Rodney, you’ve cited some of the headwinds that you faced in the third quarter, the realignment by CCR in Canada and the Nitro sales being impacted. Could you quantify how much those were a drag in terms of your top line growth in the third quarter?
Rodney C. Sacks: We – at this point I think we haven’t broken those out. Just trying to find something for you. I think the extra strength generally both in the North America were down about $4 million and works about $1.7 million. Just over – so perhaps $6 million for those two and the impact on sales in Canada – trying to find that figure for you Judy. I think was somewhere in the region of about $12 million. 
Hilton H. Schlosberg: We also spoke about the impact of the currency, which was also about $12 million in the quarter. 
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc: Right. I guess the better question is if I sort of look at the Nielsen trends and then just kind of back in and just look at the third quarter. It looks like U.S. was up by 13%, international up kind of 24% and the U.S. trends if I adjust for some of these factors do you think the 18%, 19% trends that you are seeing in Nielsen is pretty much representative of kind of what’s going on in the underlying level in terms of the U.S. sales trends. 
Rodney C. Sacks: I can’t speak – the Nielsen numbers attract sales going up from retail outlets to consumers. So this is a time actually I just don’t have, we don’t have an analysis on what that time line gives and how it affects us in different channels. What we are saying is that basically gross sales in the U.S. were up at about – North America was up at about 14% and we’ve sort of – we can only give you obviously our sales numbers. They are choppy from month-to-month depending on ordering patterns and they vary for a number of factors. And so – but obviously you are just got to try and marry those as best you can, the same way as we do with the Nielsen numbers. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with Sun Trust.
William Chappell – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Hi, good afternoon. Can you talk a little bit more about the gross margin you hit in the quarter and just anything you’ve done in terms of finding the distributor or finding I guess local manufacturing for Japan and maybe Korea to help that out?
Rodney C. Sacks: We are working towards the -- challenge in Japan and Korea is finding the right size Cans for those markets and plants that are able to produce our type of products and we are working towards that at the moment. We’ve launched in Japan in a Sleek can a 55 malt sleek Can and there isn’t – we haven’t been able to find a Sleek can available in Japan. So we’ve been working with Can companies to have them manufacture more to actually be able to supply us with a Sleek Can because the alternatives will go to – which will go to something like a 400 but it was a very stubby Can and we just didn’t feel that was right for the brand.  Getting the right product to be used in the right Cans in those two countries has been a challenge but we are actively working on doing so because we obviously we appreciate that it will remove the shipping damages and risks inherent in shipping as well as the shipping cost. And with the market -- but obviously what happens is when you start a market to make the investments and we’ll require some capital investments from us to do so as well with the Can companies and to some of the packing companies in Japan. But until we saw the sales velocities and the viability of packing locally, it just didn’t make sense to have those costs incurred upfront and then try and launch and then work, found out later whether your product was or wasn’t viable and it’s velocity. Based on the velocity we see -- it’s been very positive but the problem is there’s been higher costs or higher damages with that higher velocity. But it has accelerated our plan to go to local production and we are working on it.  We also just had some price increases in the U.K. from our packer and we had some price variances and some damages there again. We had some losses. There were a number of changes that took place in some countries for regulatory reasons and we ended up with some inventory excesses which we are obviously trying to work through to sell elsewhere. But we think we will be able to work through that as it will normalize more going forward as we continue to establish the brand and the company internationally. 
William Chappell – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: And just a follow up on the October sales…
Rodney C. Sacks: I just want to point out again. In talking about Japan and Korea, the modulates were quite substantially affected by these losses, the cost of shipping. With the result was that the business achieved, they had very low margins. Going forward we believe we will be able to obviously improve on those margins both by getting better at exporting and shipping Cans and also through local production and obviously increase sales. So those gross margins were very low in those areas because of that. Gross margins were also lower in Europe largely because of the production, and co-parking increased production losses as well. 
William Chappell – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Thanks for the color and just on the October sales I know one month doesn’t make a quarter but that’s all for I think 31% growth in October of last year. Is that sign that some of the issues are behind you or just a timing of shipment. How should we look at that October number?
Rodney C. Sacks: I think it’s a timing issue, they ship when they orders, we ship when products are ordered, whenever we can and it just falls where it falls. So going forward we’ve obviously – we are encouraged by that factor. We did see a little bit of a fall off towards the end of the quarter. Again, it was what is was and we’ve seen it pick up both – we deal with it as it comes. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan, with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co: Hi, guys. I guess one follow up to the last question. So monthly volatility has certainly increased from a sales standpoint. If you go to April and May it was up in the lower 30 if you had in June deceleration, July was up 25% August, September then worse in October back up. I realize when you get the orders and when you ship the products that you can’t fully control but is there something that you’ve thought about or is there some way that we can sort of rationalize how the selling and sell through sort of work here. So there’s a bit of an explanation for the increased volatility because obviously the underlying sales per the scanner date are good but they ship way too much volatility here month-to-month. I guess any color there. And then the second question -- so you exhausted the share repurchase authorization. How you are thinking about the roughly $600 million in cash on the balance sheet right now?
Rodney C. Sacks: First, going to the first question Mark. The best measure of the sales which gives you a smoother feel for – you need to follow the Nielsen’s, because the Nielsen’s are obviously a broad sample of different channels and if you look at the Nielsen’s going through from the July Nielsen’s, it’s pretty steady. Monster four weeks for the end of July was 20.2% up, in the convenience channels was 18.1%, in August 19.5%, in September and 19% for 20th October. That gives you a pretty smooth channel and that’s all sales are basically going year-on-year, that’s the increase in the channel. Ordering patterns from our customers are what they are. It depends on timing of promotions, timing of orders and so I can’t show any more color on that other than to say that you look at the sales going through and you got to look at – I know that everybody works off and looks at quarters but at the end of the day you also have to look an annual base in which I think gives everybody a fairer and a more balanced view of the direction of the company, the brand, the sales etcetera. Our quarters are just all choppy, that’s the only patterns have come in and that’s how we take it as it comes. 
Hilton H. Schlosberg: We sell to distributors. You know what I mean.
Rodney C. Sacks: On the stock repurchase issue. As we’ve stated in the past stock repurchases are determine by our board of directors. The board continues to review many factors affecting the company’s stock plan as well as the strength of the overall market and will at the appropriate time review whether to authorize a further stock repurchase plan. In light of the fact that we have now used up the existing plan. 
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co: Thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala, with UBS.
Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank: Also on the margin question and to make sure I understand it. How much was the actual product damages versus just the additional cost related to shipping product out to Korea and Japan. Were there pallets that needed to get resent and more one-time damages that were…
Rodney C. Sacks: There were a number of issues that we faced. Products – sometimes the specs are very tight for Japan and they really are much tighter than the U.S. project were perfectly capable in the U.S. We were being inspected and we are being rejected for minor things, the blemishes and scratches and there’s a whole host of things and dense – they have some pressure issues on cap rates and defective cap issues. So were a whole lot of issues there and again just continued to face us in shipping these large distances. And it’s something that is just difficult to ship full Cans under pressure from the U.S. to Japan. We believe that we will be able to get this more under control as we continue to regain more experience in shipping and understanding Japanese requirements. But it got to a point where literally every case had to be disassembled, examined Can-by-Can and then repacked and that’s where the costs became very high, and as a result our margins were very little but we were there, we were pregnant, we were launching and we needed to continue and the result is we’ve been able to establish our brand very strong, very solidly in the Japanese market but it certainly has been very costly for us, for all these different regions, but as we go forward we hope that we will avoid the damages, we hope we will avoid having to continue these very costly labor and meddling inspections to satisfy our Japanese customers and then retailers in Japan for our quality standards which are just very exerting because compared to the standards normally acceptable in the U.S. 
Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank: Okay. Got it. And then it sounded like from the very beginning of your opening remarks that the slowdown started about half way through the quarter and then obviously there’s bounce back in October. Was there anything specific you was feel was behind that? And then also was it timing related with selling days or anything like that?
Rodney C. Sacks: We really didn’t see anything specific. We obviously did look and try to understand and there really wasn’t anything specific other than the matters we sort of mentioned and then you’ve seen the pickup in October. We just haven’t seen it and – basically for us it was obviously we initially looked at it and said – looked at directionally but basically once we saw the numbers coming back in October, that obviously gave us a lot more comfort. But basically we think that you go back and you take into account the chemical issue which was an unexpected issue and the currency where it is. I mean the business is doing much better as I indicated, the sales are up and the numbers are up in local currencies, up over 60%. So again, it’s as if the factor -- all these factors at the time just really shaved the top.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan
John Faucher – JPMorgan : Thank you very much. A couple of questions here. It sounds like with all the extra -- you talked about the improved profitability on the international business. It sounds like with all the extra costs with Japan and everything that Europe might have seen a relatively significant increase in profitability. Is that a fair analysis to make coming out of your comments?
Rodney C. Sacks: I wouldn’t say significant, I think it had a nice increase in bottom line and they are all continuing to improve the effectiveness in Europe but we are still got a lot of individual countries where we are at the very early stages of developing the brand as a result we continue to divest quite heavily in trade development personnel, South personnel, sampling in order to make sure the product, the companies established in each of these countries. Although the – Europe again is not one country like America, each country has to be dealt with individually, different languages, different sales team, different support in order to get your brand. And even though the countries are small, you really have to support your brand and that becomes costly until you get to a sort of at least a minimum level of sales in that country and then things will start kicking in. Because we’ve got some really good shares in small countries but it’s costly. In countries like Lithuania, and last year we were up to 15% market share but when you look at it in actual case terms its very small.  So to support that get the product established there has been expensive but it is starting to kick in on its own. We’ve got very nice shares in certain of the markets like Greece, Bulgaria, some of those smaller markets in the east and then there were others that also sort of we just are still trying to get out of the blocks. So while we are all continuing to see some good change from losses to profits in those areas they will continue to improve. We are also obviously looking at trying to be a little more strict with your marketing spend to support the brand. A lot of the international properties that we started with in order to give the brand international credibility. We are trying to avoid obviously increasing that spend so that we actually end up with a spend per case lower. It is going the right way. It’s happened for the last two years and so now we believe we are going forward. We will be able to start showing better bottom line coming out of Europe.
John Faucher – JPMorgan : Great. And that’s great. And then one point of clarification here you talked about the board making a decision on the share repurchase authorization. Is it safe to say that none of the sort of noise going around that you talked about at the beginning of the call impacts your ability to repurchase stock or to authorize another repurchase program?
Rodney C. Sacks: We don’t believe so. But obviously we need to be advised by our lawyers but we don’t think so. 
John Faucher – JPMorgan : Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alec Patterson, with RCM. 
Alec Patterson – RCM Capital: Hi Rodney. First just on the October numbers I just wanted to be sort of clear, with the launches of the new products you mentioned the Cuba Lima or Lima. Sorry, I forgot the names. Was there any impact from that in those numbers?
Rodney C. Sacks: I think the loss was very light in the quarter. It was almost missed the quarter. So you had some launch numbers in the October numbers more from the sort of zero ultra then from Cuba Lima. Because that’s been a bit slow at giving out and we are still trying to get some of our distributor network to take Cuba Lima. Zero Ultra has been taken across the whole network. So that has got out net get impact to buy it, but again I am not sure of the amount of brand as you know started to do very well. But it does take time to get these brands out into the market. So it’s not as though day one you press a button you have a fortune of sales. It’s – these things do rollout over a period of months. But I don’t know the actual effect of the sales of Cuba Lima in October. If I can get that figure before the end of the call I’ll give it to you guys but I just don’t have it with me. 
Alec Patterson – RCM Capital: Okay. Fair enough. And just in terms of the December meeting. Is that still on and also just quickly, should we anticipate any surprises in the Q filing?
Rodney C. Sacks: The December meeting is going ahead of schedule. I think the 11 December. I wouldn’t think they are any surprises. I think the 10-Q will be very similar to – we’ve gone into the detail pretty extensively of the business in the quarter and the issues. So I don’t think there should be a need. But again I can’t anticipate what you might think is surprising or material, but we don’t think so.
Operator: Thank you. I am not showing any further questions at this time. I’d like turn the conference back to our host for closing remarks.
Rodney C. Sacks: I am probably not going to be able to get the information on Zero Ultra in time for the close – before the close. I apologize. But on behalf of Monster I’d like to thank each of you for your continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in our growth strategy and remain committed to developing and differentiating our brands and to expanding the company at home and abroad. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today’s presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.

===== 2012 Q2  (2012-08-08 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Member of Executive Committee and Chairman of Hansen Beverage Company
Analysts: Philip Terpolilli - Longbow Research LLC Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Alec Patterson
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monster Beverage Corporation Second Quarter 2012 Financial Results Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Rodney C. Sacks: Thanks. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President is with me today. As is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company, that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed on February 29, 2012, and our most recent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, including the sections contained therein entitled, Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated August 8, 2012. A copy of this information is also available on our website, at www.monsterbevcorp.com, in the Financial Information section. While the beverage industry, in general, experienced softness in second quarter sales volumes in North America and Europe, the energy category in our principal markets in the United States grew in the high teens in the second quarter, slightly lower than the growth rate of the energy category in the United States in the first quarter. Overall, the company had a good second quarter with record gross sales up 28.7% to $678.9 million. Net sales up 28.2% to $592.6 million and operating income up 28.1% to $169.8 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 31% from $0.45 per share in the second quarter of 2011 to $0.59 per share. We also recently commenced reporting sales information for the United States market based on an expanded sample of outlets, which now includes Walmart; dollar stores, such as Family Dollar, Dollar General and Fred's; DeCA military stores and club stores namely Sam's and BJ's, but excluding Costco. On this call and in the future, when we discuss the Nielsen reports for the United States for all outlets combined, the reports and information contained therein will be based on this expanded sample. This will not affect the reports and information covering sales in the convenience and gas channel, the grocery and or drug channels which may, from time to time, be referred to individually. As this will be the first time that we referred to reports based on the expanded sample, we will provide figures on both basis. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through July 21, 2012, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, on an expanded basis I just described, including Wal-Mart, dollar stores, DeCA military stores and club stores, but excluding Costco, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including shots, increased 16.5% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 24.9% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 19.3%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 7.2%, and sales of 5-Hour increased by 4.2%. Sales of Amp put down 2.4%, NOS increased 13.8% off a low base and sales of Full Throttle increased 6.5%. For comparative purposes, according to the Nielsen reports, for the 13-week through July 21, 2012, on the previously reported basis for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, excluding Walmart, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including shots increased 16.4% versus the same period a year ago. Sales in Monster grew 23.6% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 19.8%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 7.6% and sales of 5-Hour increased by 6.2%. Sales of Amp were down 2.2%, NOS increased 13.2% off a low base, and sales of Full Throttle increased 6%. According to the Nielsen reports for the 4 weeks ended July 21, 2012, sales of energy drink in the convenience and gas channel in dollars increased by 12.5% over the comparable 4-week period in 2011. Sales of Monster increased by 20.2% over the comparable period last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 16.2% over the comparable period last year. Rockstar was up 5.9%, while 5-Hour was up 0.7%. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 21, 2012, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 2 points over the comparable period a year ago to 31.1% against Red Bull's share of 34.5%. Rockstar's share of 8.9% and 5-Hour share was 11.5%. According to Nielsen, in the 13 weeks ended July 21, 2012, for all outlets combined, sales of energy plus coffee drinks, in dollars, increased to 21.7% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 20.2% higher than in the comparable period last year and Starbucks Double Shot energy was up 20.9%. Sales of our noncarbonated Monster Rehab tea plus energy line, according to Nielsen for the 13 weeks ended July 21, 2012, represented approximately 13% of the sales of all Monster beverages sold in the convenience and gas channel. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended June 30, 2012, the energy drink category grew 11%, Monster sales increased 11% and our market share was at 24.9% versus the same as in the comparable period last year. While Red Bull sales increased 7%, its market share decreased 1.3 points to 36.6%. Rockstar sales increased 47% and its market share increased 3.9 points to 16%. Rockstar's numbers continue to be skewed by the inclusion of sales of its Rockstar Recovery line this year, which is already in last year's numbers, or fourth in a period, as well as continued ongoing deep price promotions implemented by Rockstar in 2012. According to Nielsen, the 4 weeks ended June 30, 2012, sales of energy drinks in Canada for the convenience and gas channel grew 8%. Over this period, sales of Red Bull increased 9% and Monster increased 9%, while sales of Rockstar increased 14%. We believe that the Nielsen reports for sales of energy drink category including sales of Monster in Mexico are incomplete and are also inconsistent with our own sales of Monster to our distributor in Mexico in 2012. Sales of Monster through our distributor in México in the second quarter of 2012 were 45.6% higher than in the comparable period last year. And for the 6 months to June 30, 2012, were 32% higher. Once we are satisfied that the Nielsen reports for Mexico are reliable and complete, we will resume reporting that information to you. Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 30.1% to 600 -- sorry, $568 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, from $436.7 million in the same period in 2011. And contribution margin increased 30.1% from $150.5 million to $195.8 million. Net sales for the company's warehouse segment decreased 3.4% to $24.6 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, compared with $25.5 million for the same period in 2011. The contribution margin increased 15.5% to $1.6 million in this quarter versus $1.4 million for the same quarter last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately 1% for the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, which was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain local currencies in which we conduct certain of our international business. We estimate that our net sales for the 3 months ended June 30, 2012 were positively impacted by approximately 1% due to initial inventory purchase by a distributor in Japan for the launch of the Monster energy brand in Japan during the second quarter of 2012. For the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, gross sales to retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 4% of gross sales, the same as in the comparable period in 2011. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 9% of sales, down from 10% in the comparable period in 2011. Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 62% of sales, down from 64% in the comparable period in 2011. Gross sales internationally increased to 23% from 19% in the same period in 2011. Other sales were 2% for the period compared to 3% in the comparable period in 2011. Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the second quarter of 2012 amounted to $153.4 million compared to $102.6 million in the same quarter in 2011. Included in such sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the second quarter of 2012, in dollars, were 51.6% higher than in the same period last year. Excluding the effect of the strengthening dollar, such net sales would've been 65.4% higher. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and market share in Europe. Our European, Middle East and Africa operations, overall, are now operating profitably, although the Central and Eastern European region is still incurring operating losses. We are continuing with our expansion strategy into new international markets. We launched Monster Energy in Ecuador, Hong Kong, Japan, Macau and Slovenia in the second quarter of 2012. We are continuing with our plans to launch Monster in Chile, Peru, Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan as well additional countries overseas later in 2012 and in Argentina early in 2013. We're also planning to launch Monster in additional countries in Central and Eastern Europe later this year. Our planned launch of Monster in Korea continues to be delayed due to product approval and label issues, which have been ongoing and which we are continuing to address. Although the resolution of such issues is taking longer than we had initially anticipated, we believe that they will be resolved, and we are continuing with preparations for the launch of Monster in Korea in due course. Sales in Japan in the second quarter exceeded our expectations. Sales of Peace Tea, ready-to-drink iced teas continue to meet and indeed exceed our expectations. In the second quarter of 2012, gross sales of Peace Tea increased 62.3% over the same period in 2011. We are continuing with our plan to introduce additional packages and container sizes for the Peace Tea brand during the second half of 2012. We are continuing to sell in market Worx Energy. Gross profit margins achieved in the second quarter of 2012 were 51.8% versus 52.8% in the comparable quarter in 2011. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to geographic mix, increased promotional and other allowances as a percentage of net sales, production variances and product damages, primarily in connection with Japan and Korea. Gross profit margins achieved in North America overall were, in fact, slightly higher than in the comparable quarter in the prior year. Although, we had already covered a large portion of our anticipated requirements for aluminum cans in 2012 as well as apple juice and sugar, we increased the portion covered. Consequently, we do not believe that at current levels, any increases in the cost of raw materials will have a material effect on our margins for the remainder of 2012. Distribution expenses, as a percentage of net sales in the second quarter, were comparable with the same period in 2011. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 11.6% from 12.9% in the same period in 2011. The decrease in selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, was primarily attributable to decreases in advertising, which is primarily Worx, and point-of-sale, and was partially offset by increases in sponsorships, trade development programs and the cost of merchandise displays in the second quarter of 2012 as compared to the same quarter in 2011. As previously reported, we are continuing to invest in the Monster brand internationally, in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, Asia and South America, particularly through trade development programs to supplement our distribution partners' respective sales forces and to service and merchandise the small independent store channel. The cost of product sampling teams and trade development personnel are included as part of our selling expenses and do not form part of our payroll costs. General and administrative expenses increased 33.5% in the quarter. The increase in general and administrative costs was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses and in particular, increased stock-based compensation expense, which was $7.1 million for the quarter compared to $4.1 million last year, and $13.6 million for the 6 months ended June 30, 2012 compared to $7.9 million for the 6 months period last year. As previously reported, we have continued to hold discussions with our distribution partner in Central and Eastern Europe to more equitably allocate the value chains in various countries between us. We have moved closer towards arriving at an agreement in this regard. While we are in the process of reducing our operating and promotional costs in Australia, certain promotional costs were previously committed, and we expect that the effect of such dips will not start to result until the third quarter. We continue to hope that we will be able to achieve improved results in Australia in the second half of the year, although following such measures sales were lower in Australia during the second quarter of 2012. Sales were also low in Brazil in the quarter, primarily due to delays incurred in obtaining customs clearance for certain ingredients needed to produce our products and issues with our distributor, which we are addressing. For the quarter ended June 30, 2012, operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $2.6 million from our operations in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Australia and South America and Asia. This figure was, however, lower than the $5.8 million losses incurred for the same period last year. Our effective tax rate in the 2012 second quarter was 35.3% compared to 36.5% in the 2011 second quarter. The decrease in the 2012 second quarter effective tax rate was primarily the result of recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the completion of an IRS audit for earlier periods. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $419.2 million compared to $359.3 million at December 31, 2011. Short-term investments were $451.1 million compared to $411.3 million at December 31, 2011. Long-term investments comprised entirely of auction rate securities decreased from $23 million -- $23.2 million at December 31, 2011, to $20.9 million. Days outstanding for trade accounts receivables were 40.7 days at June 30, 2012, and 42.4 days at December 31, 2011, compared to 43.3 days at June 30 2011. Despite such reduction, as sales outside the United States continued to increase as a proportion of our overall sales, we expect that days outstanding for receivables will increase due to the different terms generally granted to customers internationally in accordance of local practices in their respective countries. Inventories increased to $199.1 million from $155.6 million at December 31, 2011. Average days of inventory was 62.7 days at June 30, 2012, which was lower than the 71.6 days of inventory at December 31, 2011. At June 30, 2012, the company held auction-rate securities with a face value of $28.3 million, was $44.8 million at December 31, 2011, with an amortized cost basis of $20.9 million. During the 2012 second quarter, the company did not repurchase any of its shares. Gross sales in July 2012 were approximately 25.3% higher than in July 2011. We are encouraged by the continuing strong sales that have been experienced by the company in North America, Western Europe and Japan. We caution again sales in the single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to, or regarded as indicative of, results for the full quarter or any future period. I'd like to open the floor to questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alton Stump with Longbow Research.
Philip Terpolilli - Longbow Research LLC: This is actually Phil Terpolilli calling in for Alton. Just a couple of quick questions. First off, with the July results. I think you said they're up 25%. Any sense of what's driving that growth, if it's more the new products you've launched over the last few years like Rehab, or if it's more of the traditional lines?
Rodney C. Sacks: Generally, we're continuing to see growth in our original market and our original product. For example, our green product, which is the original 16-ounce Monster Energy, grew as an individual SKU grew 24.9% in the 13 weeks in convenience -- in 13 weeks to July 21. So we are continuing to see growth in our original SKUs, but obviously, we are also getting benefits from the line extensions. One of the things we need to obviously, factor in on the numbers is that the [indiscernible] division although a small proportion is flat, and that does tend to take down that number slightly.
Philip Terpolilli - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Then just, I think you mentioned the gross sales number for international. So do you have a net number by chance for 2Q?
Rodney C. Sacks: I don't think we have a net number available. Sorry.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: One housekeeping question. So you called out the damages in Japan and Korea, how much was that?
Rodney C. Sacks: I don't think we are going to break that out, but we have had some challenges in shipping there. We have had different types of damage. There have some damages that are potentially reclaimable back from some of our can companies where you've had defects in cans. We've had some leakers, we've had some tab issues. We just had some general, some production issues. We also had some issues regarding just, which haven't been attributable to suppliers, but basically, just shipping -- damages during shipping, leakage which has had secondary damages. So there's just been numbers of issues and challenges in the product in going into Japan where we've launched, but we've had some high product costs. And those are the things we're obviously, learning and addressing. And with -- what we've experienced is that the obviously, the tolerance of the Japanese distributors and retailers is at a very different level to the U.S. And whilst we did appreciate that when we went in, but I mean, literally every can is inspected one by one. And if you have 3 cans which have leakers, out of 1 million cans in America, the local stores throws them away. I mean, here, there is an investigation with 200 people involved from all over the world in trying to get to the bottom of that -- very, very analytical and very precise. And that has just caused some issues. And that is one of the large issues for the slight drop in the gross margin variance. If you look at the 6-month numbers, that difference is very much smaller. And then in the case of Korea, there were some issues where we had produced products and sent in to Korea, and we believe they actually analyzed it incorrectly because they believed there was 1 of the ingredients -- we have in energy drink around the world, it's not permitted in Korea. We took it out. They reported -- they came back to say on a test they felt that they found this ingredient. We said it's not possible. We took it out. We actually had mass spec tests done in the U.S. and as well as in Korea. We've established, without any doubt that there wasn't any of that ingredient in the product. But the issue is it disrupted everything for 6 months. And so, you've had product damages because product got shipped to Korea, and some of them got shipped back and some has been stored. So there'd be a number of these issues. I mean, one of the issues we had obviously, often anticipated, commencing selling in Korea and the revenues from that anticipated launch were also obviously not realized in the quarter. But those were the main issues regarding product and product damages and's issues relating to production.
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. Well, I guess all of that being said, if you could help us, at least, directionally with what the impact was to gross margins in the second quarter, and that would be helpful. And then second question, so if you do the math on what your gross sales were April and May, it implies a bit of a deceleration in June. Obviously, you talked about what you did on gross sales in July. So what explains the deceleration in June? Was it comparison -- I mean, what else is there, and can you talk a bit about how you think about the July number rebounding?
Rodney C. Sacks: Mark, just going back to the original question, and the amount. I mean, the amount makes up a large portion of the 1% change in the mix, and that is the geographic mix there's -- there were high costs of shipping and inspection cost relating to Japan, so our margins on the Japanese business that we launched were very much lower. We think some of those will be ongoing, there will be some recoupment. And then ultimately, the idea is obviously for us, the intention is to produce locally, which will change that whole business model. But geographic mix, with the main portion. The damages and costs that we've talked about, there was also some allowance or some of it was reclassification of certain commissions because some of our distributors, as we're paying some commissions to, for example, Anheuser-Busch, once they take over ownership of a particular branch, they then become our customer. That particular commission is then, basically, instead of being below the line, deduction really goes into lowering gross sales to net. So those things have all had an impact on that 1% change in the gross profit. But many of them are not -- we hope, we don't think they will be ongoing and they will be rectified. As we go forward, will be more of sort of normalized more. Then, with regard to other part of your question, I think there was a deceleration, but a lot of that again, is a single month. It depends on the day in which -- the Fourth of July fell and then you're selling or to the Fourth of July, there is, I think, a day shorter in the month and measures like that. But there has been a little deceleration in the category. But the numbers are still very healthy as you can see from the numbers that we just discussed.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
Rodney C. Sacks: Judy, before we finish go on with the question, one of the previous callers had asked for net sales. I have managed to get the information. Net sales figure to customers outside the United States amounted to $124.4 million, as compared to $78.1 million in the same period last year.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. My first question is really just in terms of your balance sheet, and I know you talked about this at the last conference call, and you talked about this at the shareholder meeting, but just in terms of how you guys are thinking about the use of cash and why is it taking so long to really make the decision in terms of just returning some of that cash to shareholders.
Rodney C. Sacks: That's a question I really am not in a position to answer. It's a board issue. There are other matters that -- and factors that come into that position. Obviously, we are aware of it, and we will take action when we believe it is in the best interest of the company. Bearing in mind, other discussions and other matters that are ongoing at the moment. And it is possibly likely to change in the near future. It will take some different decision, but really, I'm just not in a position to discuss that further.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I mean, is that thought process sort of any different today than 3 months ago, just given that your stock price obviously, has come down more recently? And you talked about this being a Board decision, but you guys are on the Board. So what are some of the things that you guys are kind of looking at and are there any timeline, or are there any milestones that you have to sort of achieve before you make the decision or this isn't about the...
Rodney C. Sacks: It's nothing of that nature. It is a Board issue. Sure, we are on the Board. But we're looking at the company and the share price is higher, or it's lower. Like any individual, we make a decision to buy or sell shares, we make a decision to buy or sell the company shares or not to sell, but in this case to buy. There are many factors that we look at, and we will review the company's position [indiscernible] in the light of some other factors that we have been engaged in with the board as well as the share price, which is just another factor. But there's no hard fast rule that we have to make or will make a decision by any particular date. We'll see how -- well, depending on how the share price reacts, we may change our position. It's something that we just retain the right to be reasonably flexible on.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just in terms of the broader category trends. So just looking at some of the Nielsen numbers that you cited for the 4 weeks, a bit of a deceleration. If you can just maybe talk to us about sort of what's driving that -- some deceleration for the category. And then, it looks like maybe the promotional activity has heated up a little bit recently, would you agree with that view? And if so, kind of what's happening in terms of the promotional activity?
Rodney C. Sacks: I don't really think there is a lot of heat in the promotional activity. It is summer. There's been little -- a small drop in our average unit price over the quarter. But we don't believe that is out of the ordinary. It's on that side, Judy. As regards to the category, the category -- on the one hand, there has been a little deceleration, on the other hand, when you look at the category, the category's growth now, it's not very different to what it was last year around about this time. And what happened was the category decelerated from July to September last year. And then, started to sort of level the [indiscernible] and started to pick up again, and then been in the high teens and then sort of really peaked in May. And then, it's sort of back to those levels. But I mean, they're very respectable mid-teens growth in the category. And so, we're also creating more bigger numbers as the category continues to grow. It's continuing to create bigger numbers, and so we still thing that it's a very healthy category. We don't believe that we can read into it too much at this stage from any trends. And if you look at our own numbers going forward for July comments, it's still up, a very healthy number.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with UBS.
Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I guess the first question is, that I'm following up on, what Judy was asking -- but between cash and marketable securities are pushing very close to almost $1 billion now. We think buyback, we think dividend. Outside of that, it's maybe M&A. But can give some more context on what other factors you're referring to?
Rodney C. Sacks: Obviously, we look and keep our eyes open for any potential acquisition that we may believe, would be beneficial over the long term, and when and if it comes along, we will do that. We have the resources to make that certain acquisition, but they haven't, and therefore we have not done it. There's been no bar to doing it or no impediment other than that. We look at the use of cash, and it's there, and we realize that cash could be used for either dividend purposes or repurchase, and that we've got to make out decisions as we go along and there are various factors that -- I think that we obviously favor the repurchase, that's pretty much more would be now modus operandi for many years. But we look at it conservatively and sometimes, the share price rises and gets away, and for whatever the reason, we've decided at that point in time not to go into the market. That will change on a daily basis, just as we look at the market and the company and look at that we are acutely conscious of the size of the cash and the fact that it is returning low income back to shareholders. But again, we've been able to make sure that we been able to finance the growth of the company without any restrictions and again, we will relook at the share -- at the buyback program and once we see where the share price goes after -- into the open period. Until now we've not been able to do anything.
Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Got it. So it would be fair for us to infer, or at least, assume that if there was weakness in the stock price, it would be a lot more likely to buy back shares versus your last open period during the second quarter, where you didn't buy back any?
Rodney C. Sacks: You're putting words in his mouth.
Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I just asked to infer. But, let's move to Japan. Some of the things you talked about relating to Japan and in particular, to the rollout. Does it sound like those are onetime items during the launch or is Japan one of those markets that perhaps costs a little bit more to service?
Rodney C. Sacks: I think that, while we continue to export product from here to Japan, it will probably cost a little more than other markets to service because of the precision in which they operate businesses. Right from our distributor partner, right through to the retail chains. They are very conscious of any damage issues or defect issues and they literally simply do not have the same level of tolerance as we normally have when we conduct business in the United States. And but that being said, there's a learning curve both for us, and our canners and packers and how to ship products and how to make sure that it gets there less damaged, and how to, in certain cases, to use certain packers who are a little more precise in the way they actually pack the product and their measurements. But there were a number of things that happened at the same time. And some of them where in fact actual can issues as opposed to production issues. Some were shipping issues. We believe that it will go down as we continue to get -- and this is going down already, as we get more experience in this and as we fine tune our ability to trade in those areas. The Korea issues was just not a not of a making of generally, of production as much. It was some issues just with labeling issues in Korea. We've been going through, basically, a new category, that the category only opened for energy drinks that contained taurine and the normal ingredients. And sort of even there we have to have a different source, you can't use regular caffeine. And so we're sort of, even the officials there [indiscernible] as to what their regulations are, and how do they categorize our products and how do they categorize different products of ours. And so, that's been stop/start and that was the experience of some of the competitive products that have been launched there that aren't manufactured in the country, have also got in and then ended up being taken off the shelves and having to be reimported and remanufactured. The big problem there was we actually, unfortunately, ended up with an analysis of -- a mistaken analysis of something that was in our product that wasn't there. We established that with absolutely conclusively. But it takes a lot of time, and so we're sort of re-gearing now because we're dealing with a product that's been sitting on the docks there and places for months and with having to reinspect, and there are leakers, so we're incurring certain costs and pretty much dealt with those are the issues that we are going through at the moment. Again once we get going in Korea we don't believe that these problems will be ongoing. We are slowly starting to get different SKUs approved now through the authorities that are now retesting them and agreeing that they don't contain any ingredients that shouldn't be in there. And so we are starting to reship and starting to re-prepare for our launch in Korea. So we believe it will settle down. But those have been really the issues -- the challenges we have actually faced in this quarter. But the market -- the receptions, if I could just add too, the sales in Japan have really been very, very positive and that is -- that trend is continuing.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Alec Patterson with RCM.
Alec Patterson: Two things. First question just you went through the gross margins, puts and takes, but I just sort of wondering, what you were referring to on the raw material trend and the hedging position if we sort of backed out the geographic mix, and the damages and all those other things. Would you say that your cost of goods per case is trending flat to down this year?
Rodney C. Sacks: It's trending flat to down in the U.S. In Europe it's been a little bit higher largely because of production issues in Europe and in our export business, because of production issues. A lot of shipping to Japan, a lot of extra inspection costs until everybody gets comfortable from the Japanese side, gets comfortable with our products, et cetera.
Alec Patterson: Okay. All right. But the underlying seems fairly favorable.
Rodney C. Sacks: Yes. And that's why I did refer to the fact in the overall, in the North American market, which is our principal market, our actual margins are actually slightly up.
Alec Patterson: Got it. Yes, it makes sense. So, just looking into the back half of this year, you've been talking about Brazil and Korea for some time, and obviously, Japan gets in the mix here about things sort a being put on a bit of a delayed mode on the international markets. Is that affecting the way you're thinking about how things are ramping up in the expansion markets into the back half, or should we think of these things as a little deferred or not as much of an issue?
Rodney C. Sacks: I think it's probably -- it's just a little bit deferred. In the case of Brazil, we have a small distributor, and they just have struggled to get the resources in line to basically take advantage of the market to the extent that we believe we should be able to achieve as our fair share. And so, we are addressing that issue and that is taking some time, because it's a big country, Brazil, and we obviously want to make sure that however we address it with staff, with people, with a whole different ways. Obviously we're looking to that as being a potentially large market in the future, and we are still confident we will be able to achieve that. In the case of Korea, that's just really got deferred revenue. We think Korea is an exciting market. We think it will be very positive for Monster. We think that our margins will be -- hopefully, we think will be a little better there than we are in Japan, where it's just been a lot of cost of goods shipping to Japan, inspecting products, before they get released has been very costly. And we were hoping that just as we continue to settle down, those costs will reduce. What we are all trying to achieve, and we are having some issues about trying to find the right size cans and the right production plants, but once we get that, we can overcome that. Our plan is to produce in Korea and in Japan, as much of our requirements there as possible. And that will remove a lot of these issues. So that's not really a change. It's a question of -- it's timing, we'll get there. It's going to take a bit longer. But we will get there. The expansion plans into Europe, and everywhere else are ongoing along fine and they're continuing as planned. And those are the major markets, particularly, the U.K., Spain, Germany, they're all doing very well.
Operator: That does conclude our Q&A session. I'd like to turn back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks for closing remarks.
Rodney C. Sacks: Thanks very much. Just in closing, I'd like to sort of just relate back to the numbers where, I know we've had some issues, or looking at the issues on the growth and the category. But often, I think we get a little bit spoiled and carried away by some of the increased growth numbers that happen from time to time. But like everything else, this is a young and evolving category. And so, some of the growth rates are -- you see spikes in it and you see some drop-offs, but generally, the growth rates that we're seeing and the carry over, the past 12 to 15 months are much higher than the growth rates we saw probably the previous 15 to 24 months. So the category is still growing well. When you look at the volumes in North America in CSDs and other products, which are flat to negative, the product, the category is healthy and the brand is basically continuing to take share even though we really have a large share. So it continues to all do well for the company and the brand and this is our main markets, so we're very encouraged by that. As we've indicated, the European markets are really starting to get to a sort of level where they're actually starting to really kick in at a much better pace. The sort of -- the acceleration of sales we are seeing in the U.K. and Spain and even Germany now is really starting to show. And so we are pretty positive about our prospects going forward for those markets. And we are dealing with the operational issues and challenges we have. But in the long term, we are very, very encouraged by the fact that the Asian markets are very receptive to our brand, to the taste. So we again, believe that it is a journey but there's a good end game insight. And thank you for your support. And we are just going to continue to put our heads down and continue to hopefully, continue to deliver what we believe to be very good results as we head on in this quarter. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2012 Q1  (2012-05-09 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to your Monster Beverage Corporation First Quarter 2012 Financial Results Conference. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. And now I would like to introduce your host for today, Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO.

 The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Other Information attached to the earnings release dated May 9, 2012. A copy of this information is also available at our website, www.monsterbevcorp.com, in the Financial Information section.
 The beverage industry generally appears to have improved in the first quarter of 2012, as evidenced by the positive results recently reported on by the major beverage companies. The consensus appears to be that the macroeconomic environment in the United States is improving, which is consistent with our experience in the first quarter. 
 We are pleased to report yet again another record first quarter with gross sales up 26.9% to $517.3 million. Net sales up 27.5% to $454.6 million and operating income up 42.8% to $126.3 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 39.7% from $0.29 per share in the first quarter of 2011 to $0.41 per share. 
 According to the Nielsen report, for the 13 weeks through April 21, 2012, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, excluding Wal-Mart, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including shots, increased 17.6% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 26.2% in the 13-week period while sales of Red Bull increased by 20%, sales of Rockstar increased by 17.2% and sales of 5-Hour increased by 6.9%. Sales of Amp decreased 0.1 of a percent. Sales of NOS increased 10.2% off a low base and sales of Full Throttle decreased 0.9%. 
 According to the Nielsen reports, for the 4 weeks ended April 21, 2012, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel, in dollars, increased by 19% over the comparable 4-week period in 2011. Sales of Monster increased by 24.9% over last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 23.1% over last year. Rockstar was up 14.2% while 5-Hour was up 10%. 
 According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April 21, 2012, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 1.4 points over a year ago to 30.5% against Red Bull's share of 32.4%, Rockstar's share of 9.4% and 5-Hour's share of 10.7%.
 According to Nielsen, in the 13 weeks ended April 21, 2012 for all outlets combined, sales of energy plus coffee drinks, in dollars, increased 22.7% over the same period last year. Java Monster was up 23% higher than last year and Starbucks Double Shot Energy was up 27.2%. Sales of our new non-carbonated Monster Rehab tea + energy line, the first SKU of which was launched back in the first quarter of 2011, continues to accelerate. 
 In the first quarter of 2012, we launched our first SKU in the Monster Rehab line namely tea + orangeade + energy, as well as our Übermonster energy drinks in glass bottles. 
 Monster's market share and sales in Canada continued to improve. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended March 10, 2012, the energy drink category grew 11%. Monster sales increased 12% and our market share increased 0.1 points to 24.5%, while Red Bull sales increased 8% and its market share decreased 1.1 points to 36%. 
 Rockstar sales increased 43% and its market share increased 3.7 points to 16.6%. We believe that Rockstar's numbers in this period in Canada was skewed due to the inclusion of sales of its Rockstar Recovery line this year, which were not in last year's numbers and as well as due to deep price promotions implemented by Rockstar in the first quarter of 2012.
 According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended March 31, 2012, sales of energy drinks in Canada across all market channels grew 12.5%. Over this period, sales of Red Bull increased 13.9%. Sales of Monster increased 17.4% and sales of Rockstar increased 20.2%.
 According to Nielsen, sales of the energy drink category in Mexico, in March 2012, were 5.6% lower than in the same period last year. Monster's market share in Mexico, in March 2012, increased by 1.2 points to 35.7% over the same period last year, which includes Java Monster, compared to Red Bull's share at 36.7%, although sales of Monster in Mexico were 2.2% lower than last year versus sales of Red Bull, which were 22.9% lower. 
 Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 28.8% to $431.2 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2012, from $334.7 million in the same period in 2011. And contribution margin increased 35.4% from $110.1 million to $149.1 million. 
 Net sales for the company's warehouse segment increased 8% to $23.4 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2012, compared with $21.7 million for the same period in 2011. And contribution margin increased $2.2 million this quarter versus a loss of $0.3 million for the same quarter last year.
 For the 3 months ended March 31, 2012, gross sales to retail groceries, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 4% of gross sales, down from 5% in 2011. Gross sales through club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 10% of sales, the same as in 2011. Gross sales to full-service distributors represents 65% of sales, also the same as in 2011. Gross sales internationally increased to 19% from 18% in the same period of 2011. Other sales were 2% for the period, the same as 2011.
 Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the first quarter of 2012 amounted to $100.6 million compared to $72.8 million in the same quarter in 2011. Included in such sales were sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. 
 Net sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa in the first quarter of 2012, in dollars, were 53.3% higher than in the same period last year. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and market share in Europe. Western Europe continues to operate profitably and operating income improved over the same period last year. We are continuing with our expansion strategy into new international markets. We launched Monster Energy in Poland in the first quarter of 2012, and retail sales of Monster Energy commenced in Hong Kong and Macau in April 2012 and in Japan and Ecuador earlier this week. 
 We are planning to launch Monster in Chile, Peru, Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan, as well as additional countries overseas later in 2012 and in Argentina early in 2013. We're also planning to launch Monster in additional countries in Central and Eastern Europe later this year. 
 Our planned launch of Monster in Korea in April was delayed due to product approval issues, which we are addressing. We believe that these issues will be resolved shortly and we will be able to proceed with the launch of Monster in Korea, early in the second half of 2012. 
 Sales of Peace Tea, ready-to-drink iced teas, continue to meet and, indeed, exceed our expectations. In the first quarter of 2012, gross sales of Peace Tea increased 86.4% over the same period in 2011. We recently launched 3 new line extensions, namely, Cranberry Iced Tea, Pink Lemonade + Tea and Texas Style Sweet Tea to replace certain SKUs that were soft. 
 We are continuing to build distribution and sales for Worx Energy. 
 Gross profit margins achieved in the first quarter of 2012 were 53.1% versus 52.1% in the comparable quarter in 2011. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially attributable to increased operating efficiencies, product mix and the decrease in certain product costs. Gross margins achieved for international sales, other than those sold from the United States, were lower in the first quarter of 2012 than in the comparable quarter in 2011. 
 Although we have covered a large portion of our anticipated requirements for aluminum cans in 2012 and a portion of our anticipated requirements for apple juice and sugar, we did experience some increases in raw material cost in the first quarter of 2012 and expect to continue to experience limited increases during the remainder of the year. However, we do not believe that if current levels increases in cost of raw materials will have a material negative effect on our margins. 
 Distribution expense as a percentage of net sales in the first quarter were slightly higher than the same period in 2011. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 12.3% from 13.7% in the same period in 2011. The decrease in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to decreases in advertising, primarily for Worx, and commissions, which was partially offset by increases in sponsorships, the cost of premiums and GDMs in the first quarter of 2012 as compared to the same quarter in 2011. 
 As previously reported, we are continuing to invest in the Monster brand internationally, in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Australia and South America, particularly, through trade development programs to support our distribution partners' respective sales forces, to service and merchandise the small independent store channel. The cost of product sampling teams and training development personnel are included as part of our selling expenses and do not form part of our payroll costs.
 General and administrative expenses, although higher in dollars, decreased marginally as a percentage of net sales in the quarter. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses and, in particular, increased cost of stock-based compensation. 
 As previously reported, we are continuing to hold discussions with our distribution partner in Central and Eastern Europe to more equitably allocate the value chains in various countries between us. We believe that successful discussions combined with reduced operating cost per case should enable us to achieve improved operating results in 2012, in Central and Eastern Europe. However, we have to date not been able to arrive at an acceptable agreement with this distribution partner. 
 Beginning the 2012 second quarter, we have managed to reduce certain operating costs in Australia and have limited our spend on commercial costs with our Australian distributor. As a result, we are hopeful that we will be able to achieve improved results in Australia in 2012 and beyond.
 Operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $4.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, from our operations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australasia and South America, as compared to $3.2 million for the same period last year. The increase in which was attributable to Australia, Eastern Europe and our expansion markets. 
 Our effective tax rate in the 2012 first quarter was 39.9% compared with 38% in the 2011 first quarter. The increase in the 2012 first quarter effective tax rate was primarily the result of establishing a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary during the 3 months ended March 31, 2012, and tax rate differences between the different jurisdictions on certain intercompany charges. 
 Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $391.4 million compared to $359.3 million at December 31, 2011. Short-term investments were $419.6 million compared to $411.3 million at December 31, 2011. Long-term investments comprise the entirety of auction rate securities decreased from $23.2 million at December 31, 2011 to $21.9 million. Trade accounts receivables are now presented on a gross basis as our promotional allowances owed to those customers, that the company does not allow net settlement, such as our full-service distributors. 
 We continue to present that portion of the promotional allowances owed to those customers that the company allows net settlement on a net basis. On such basis, trade account receivables increased to $255.7 million from $218.1 million at December 31, 2011. 
 Days outstanding for receivables, consistent with the above treatment, were 44.8 days at March 31, 2012 and 42.4 days at December 31, 2011 compared to 48.4 days at March 31, 2011. 
 As sales outside United States continue to increase as a proportion of our overall sales, days outstanding for receivables are expected to increase due to the different terms generally granted to customers internationally in accordance with local practices in their respective countries. 
 Inventories increased to $179.1 million from $155.6 million at December 31, 2011. Average days of inventory was 75.5 days at March 31, 2012, which is higher than the 71.6 days of inventory at December 31, 2011. 
 At March 31, 2012, the company held auction rate securities with a face value of $29.1 million, $44.8 million at December 31, 2011 with an amortized cost basis of $21.9 million. 
 Gross sales in April 2012 were approximately 39% higher than in April 2011. This includes opening shipments, through established inventory, in Japan. Excluding Japan, sales are approximately 53% above last year. We're encouraged by the continuing a strong sales that have been experienced by the company. 
 We caution, again, that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week for which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. 
 During the 2012 first quarter, the company did not repurchase any of its shares. I'd like to open the floor to questions. Thank you. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Alec Patterson from RCM. 
Alec Patterson: Just a couple of quick ones. One, when you were referencing the $4.3 million loss. I just want to make sure, we're talking about essentially all geographies outside of North America and Mexico? 
Rodney Sacks: Not Mexico. It's all the other geographies -- it excludes Canada and Mexico. 
Alec Patterson: Okay. And do you by chance, by now, have any market share data for at least Western Europe? 
Rodney Sacks: We do. I don't have it handy at the moment, the most current information. It hasn't come through to me. I'm expecting it later this week. 
Alec Patterson: And then just lastly, Rodney, the cash keeps kind of piling up. I know you've been in the market on occasion for the stock. Have you given any further thought to other uses of cash, in terms of returns to shareholders or other uses at this point? What's kind of the thinking, dividend, et cetera, in terms of the mix of thoughts? 
Hilton Schlosberg: Alec, this is Hilton. We have been considering various options and we will proceed with our discussions in that regard. 
Alec Patterson: More to come, is what you mean? 
Hilton Schlosberg: Yes. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll open up our next question from Alton Stump from Longbow Research. 
Alton Stump: Did you say, Rodney, that uncontrolled sales were up 53%, is that what you said for April? 
Rodney Sacks: That is true -- no, no. 53% is international sales and the sales for April was $39 million, including the sales to Japan and $33 million, if you exclude the sales to Japan. 
Alton Stump: Okay. As an overall company, what were sales up, sorry, in April? 
Rodney Sacks: Sorry? 
Alton Stump: As an overall company sales number, what were they up in April? 
Rodney Sacks: It was 39%. 
Alton Stump: Okay, 39%. With that number, obviously, that's a pretty big acceleration from the growth that you saw in the first quarter. I know you mentioned that after one month can also differ, after various factors, but is there any single factor or 2 that you can point to that drove that acceleration in April? 
Rodney Sacks: I think again you need to take the opening sales to Japan out, and then the number is $33 million, which is a little higher than the average in the first quarter. But again, all I can really point to, all the quantifications that I gave in my remarks earlier, that it is one month and it has to be taken as one month. Really, one month doesn't make a summer. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Marcus Astrachan of Stifel, Nicolaus. 
Mark Astrachan: Housekeeping. Rehab and Java Monster sales in the quarter, what were they? 
Rodney Sacks: I will try and get indication of those figures for you. I will come back to that. 
Mark Astrachan: All right. Yes, I guess, just on an overall basis, you look at across the country and it seems like you guys, the category maybe has been focusing a bit more on promotions in terms of 2 for $4. I guess, I'm just curious, how much of that do you think has contributed to this surge in overall category growth and obviously, within your business, in particular, but are you concerned that the consumer gets overly reliant on that, do you think it's actually a good thing for the category? 
Rodney Sacks: I don't believe it is that prevalent. There is -- there are promotions, I just don't have a feeling that it has been so extraordinarily, that's it's really even something I am been really conscious of. I'm really not in the position to quite -- really haven't really featured on our radar screen as positive, negative or anything of importance to be really looking at, and we haven't done. So I really am not in a position to really talk without speculating. 
Hilton Schlosberg: We have always done promotions, Mark. I don't see it as being more prevalent than in the past. 
Mark Astrachan: So you guys haven't stepped up any sort of promotions and the categories are just doing better. 
Rodney Sacks: I can't give you an analysis, an exact -- it's not an exact science but when I look at our average pricing, for example, in convenience of the general Monster, it's $0.02 lower, which to me it doesn't indicate any sort of major change or over-promotion at all. Going back to the -- just looking at our off-invoice numbers as well, just trying to get a better handle on that, again, comparing to the last quarter of last year, it's really very much in -- almost similar in numbers and it's lower than the third quarter of last year, which was summer. But they are lower. So there's nothing that's extraordinary. Just going back to the Rehab, your questions on Rehab and Java. These are gross numbers, I don't have net at the moment, but the gross numbers were approximately $28 million in the quarter for Java and $45 million for Rehab. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from John Faucher of JPMorgan. 
John Faucher: Two questions here. First up and I realize this is an inexact science so, using the international numbers and the total company numbers, I backed out to sort of U.S. growth in the 30% plus range for April, does that seem correct? And then you kind of snuck in the very last sentence in the prepared remarks that you didn't buy back stock in the first quarter. Can you give us an indication in terms of why that was? 
Rodney Sacks: It wasn't snuck in, it was... 
John Faucher: There was no elaboration on it. It was the very last comment and then, okay, let's go to questions. 
Rodney Sacks: We just didn't. And I don't think that there's anything that I really would care to discuss, but there's nothing to discuss. We just looked at it, we looked at the shape, the performance of the company and other things we are occupied with. And we just didn't -- decided to not to buy back stock in that period and didn't do so. We're sort of evaluating a number of alternatives about, with regard to what use we want to make of that cash and so we just didn't buy back stock. So there's really nothing more I can really elaborate on that. 
John Faucher: Okay. So nothing in terms of whether there was legal issue or a valuation issue or anything like that? 
Rodney Sacks: No. 
John Faucher: Okay. And then the first question was sort of U.S. 30% plus in April, does that sound about right? 
Rodney Sacks: It's probably in that region but that is a very -- just I'm sitting here without all the facts in front of me that's probably [indiscernible] that region. 
John Faucher: Understandable. Okay, great. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. 
Judy Hong: Rodney, on Rehab, so you're going to start to lap the launch last year, so I just curious what you're kind of seeing on that brand, first, from ACB perspective. It looks like it's running around 84%, 85% based on our data versus the core Monster Green kind of 95% plus. So when do you think you can sort of get to the core Monster ACB for Rehab and do you sense that you are actually attracting new users into the category and with other new SKUs that you've launched more recently? What sort of traction are you getting from additional shelf spaces, additional doors and some of the stores? 
Rodney Sacks: Judy, the Rehab numbers, our distribution that I got for Rehab in convenience is up to about 81%. It's sort of been sticking at that level for the last quarter. Absolutely Zero, which we introduced before Rehab is about the 78% mark. So there is opportunity to expand it but, again, it's not the core so it actually becomes a little harder to, for whatever reason, to get it above those levels. So that's really where we are. So we do have an opportunity to, obviously, still increase but it may -- I'm looking at the graph and it sort of is flattening a little bit. So it is probably just a little harder to get that sort of 90% distribution level for your third and fourth and fifth SKU, when you do have quite have a selection. So obviously, it depends on sometimes there just isn't enough shelf space allocated. In the biggest stores, you've got 3 shelves or 4 shelves, I'm sure you can get a lot of -- in it. It's a lot easier. In some small stores, we they -- 1 or 2 shelves, the guys are going to make a choice because we have a big, basically, portfolio in the Monster range and I'm just seeing that it's sort of at that 80%, 81% level in the 3 months. Obviously, we're going to look to try and increase it. But that is where it is at. 
Judy Hong: Okay and then, internationally, so in April you said Japan's expansion added about 6 points to your sales growth. It sounds like that's a pretty big number for one market. So can you kind of frame for us, I mean, is Japan, just given the size of category of a pretty big market that you needed to see that sort of step up in terms of expansion? Can you just give us some flavor of why that number was pretty big? 
Rodney Sacks: I think the reason is that the distribution partner and as in line with traditional -- Japanese tradition, they are very precise in their analyses of the market, what is the potential. There is -- we're producing the products here so there's a long lead time to produce and ship it and have it examined, and checked and inspected and they're very, very -- it's a very pedantic, very slow exercise. So there was a large opening order placed in order to ensure that sufficient inventory was on hand in Japan and available, with back-up inventory, et cetera. The other thing is that, in Japan, they are very efficient. Literally we sold, yesterday, for the first day, and we literally have 90% distribution in almost all of the convenience chains there, literally within the first day. That's something that, in the most efficient markets otherwise, we don't achieve in even 6 months. And so they really had a large opening inventory. Obviously, so the issue is how far till it'll turn to repeat orders and go forward. So the market here is a -- not a large market, but it is a nice market and we believe that it's capable of growing into a large market. And obviously we are excited about the Japanese market and the launch. But that is especially why we refer to these figures because it's an unusual position for us to have this level of opening orders, even in a market that size. The opening was very much larger that we would've ordinarily put into a similar-sized market. 
Judy Hong: And lastly, I missed your answer to Tom's question about the buyback, so did you say that you didn't buy back in the quarter, was there any legal constraints in terms of your -- the ability to buy back... 
Rodney Sacks: No. we don't have any legal or other constraints. It was simply a question of us evaluating, looking at a number of other alternatives, evaluating -- we really just end up -- make the decision to actually go ahead with the buyback. 
Operator: And we'll go with our next question from Kaumil Gajrawala from UBS. 
Kaumil Gajrawala: If I can also ask about the cash balance for a minute, you got about over $800 million on your balance sheet, you are generating about $350 million a year. I know you're not ready to make an announcement but in the past you said that the dividends were -- in the past being about 3 years ago, dividends were out of the question. Given where you are now and how you see the next couple of years putting themselves out, and also a reluctance maybe to do a buyback, can you talk about how you're thinking about dividends? 
Hilton Schlosberg: I mentioned earlier, Kaumil, that the board is considering a number of alternatives and those discussions are progressing. 
Rodney Sacks: I think that there have been no change in our basic philosophy. It doesn't mean we would rule out a dividend forever but certainly it's not on our radar at the moment. I think what's more likely is, ultimately, is to use that cash to buy back shares or for other purposes which we are. We're just looking at other options before we commit to a buyback -- a new buyback program. 
Kaumil Gajrawala: Okay, got it. And then you talked a bit about some new efficiencies, some streamlining. Can you talk maybe specifically about the U.S. and where profitability has been trending in the U.S. because with the big rollout is international, it's been a little harder to see how things have been progressing in the United States so could you maybe give some context on that? 
Rodney Sacks: The U.S. has been pretty constant. Our margins have been reasonably stable and we've been able to generally keep ourselves within a pretty close range. We've continued to obviously invest in the brand as we continue to increase and roll out new products so some of the new product investments may have possibly gone to offset some of the savings and efficiencies we would have on some of the older brands. I'm not sure how else to answer your question other than to really say it's been consistent, it's remained profitable and I don't see much of a change in either the gross margins or operating margins. There are differences in quarters because of timing and because of particular programs when we sometimes front load a promotion or higher as a percentage in a first quarter where your sales are lower and lower in the summer. But other than those there are no major swings that have really been -- have had any real significance -- the swings have really come from, obviously, the investments and the launches, from time to time overseas, and issues we've had with that and so we've been -- and those are continuing, starting to settle down and starting to get in more into a growth mode and a profitable mode, as I indicated for -- with regard for the Western Europe, which is our main area outside of the U.S. arm, excluding Canada and Mexico, they have been -- we've had business there for some time and they're both been profitable for a number of years. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Bill Chappell from SunTrust. 
William Chappell: Just a little color on a couple of things, one, and maybe I missed it, you talked about the Mexican market being down year-over-year, can you maybe give us a full color on that? 
Rodney Sacks: The actual energy drink market in Mexico, again, on the Mexican numbers, we get our Nielsen and compare it, really it's one month, month-to-month. So this month, it was March this year versus March last year. And again, those numbers tend to jump around a little bit depending on whether there are promotions by either the largest player and competitor to us, which is either Red Bull or ourselves. The market is very largely influenced by the OXXO chain. They have a very significant percentage share of the market and, again, by just doing a promotion whether it's Red Bull or us, in OXXO really skews that market, literally can push it up or down. And they did have some tax issues. They introduce a tax on energy drinks that have a little bit of a dampening effect as to how you deal with it, we sort of reformulated our product and that was last year and we sort of did see sort of a reasonably good increase in our sales. So this was just -- the category is just sort of it's been up and down like this in the last few months. So it's down 5%, roughly, and we have actually increased share although our actual sales levels are marginally down. But again I think it can change from month-to-month quite dramatically depending on whether we implement a promotional program with OXXO. It has a very big influence on those numbers. So the key for us is really more of the market share-ish information and we think that the category will ultimately start to grow or show growth again later in the year. 
William Chappell: And since we're talking about other countries such as Japan, is there a way now as you're getting into the quantified -- what the potential is, I mean, is it bigger than Mexico, is it more like a Canada, I mean, how should we look at that in terms of the opportunities? 
Rodney Sacks: You really can't compare it. Apples and pears, in other parts of the world, with a whole different buying philosophy, and a different sortie [ph]. The category at the moment is thought to be about 2.5 million cases, maybe a little bigger, maybe 3 million cases, and it has been growing. But that's what I would define as the Western or modern energy category. There has always been an energy type category in Japan, a traditional energy, for many, many decades. They're usually little vials, 2.5 ounces, small glass bottles or other containers, flat containers and that's been around for a long time. That category is probably as big as a 50 million case category. The question is how long will it take for the Japanese consumer to be partially converted from traditional energy to modern energy, and then how many new consumers, who are not in the traditional energy category. Now can you actually -- by having different products, different flavors, we believe that will help stimulate attention to the category and bring in new consumers in Japan. And then there is a big market and we believe that can grow but we're in the area of guessing at the moment because we -- we only have those facts, roughly but we think that there is a lot of potential but it's going to take time to grow into that potential and then see what we can do. But those are the 2 sources we would hope to draw from in order to increase the base energy category and we hope to obviously then participate in that quite -- at a high sort of share. So we're hopeful for it, but if we really don't have statistics that I can give you that are reliable. It's absolutely different to Canada and Mexico. Just the -- those markets are very much closer to the U.S. there. The beverage consumption patterns are closer to the U.S. whereas in Japan, I think is a much more traditional and a very different market. 
William Chappell: And Hilton, did you give a tax rate for the full year? 
Hilton Schlosberg: We gave the tax rate for the quarter. 
William Chappell: Can you give us an idea for the full year? 
Hilton Schlosberg: We're going to take that question under advisement. We -- this quarter was affected by the establishment of the full federation allowance against the fair taxation of foreign subsidiary. At this time, we expect that the tax rate probably will be comparable to the previous year but I'll have to take that under advisement. 
Operator: And that does allow all the time we have for questions today. I would now like to turn the conference back to Rodney for any concluding remarks. Please go ahead. 
Rodney Sacks: Thanks, once again. We all are pretty gratified by the performance of the category and our company, particularly, the Monster brand in this first quarter. We've given you the indication of our sales in April, so we're positive going forward. And we're also very excited about the Rehab line. Again just to repeat, even the Peace Tea line has really started to come into its own and we think that also  can develop into a very nice brand for the company going forward. 
 So just keep our heads down, we carry on trading, we're also hopeful for Europe, also starting to perform very nicely and, hopefully, we'll be in a position to report continuing good results when we report on the next quarter. Thank you very much for your attendance and speak to you soon. 
Operator: Okay, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

===== 2011 Q4  (2012-02-23 00:00:00) =====

 We are pleased to report, yet again, another record fourth quarter with record gross sales up 28.4% to $467.3 million. Record net sales up 28.7% to $410 million and diluted earnings per share increasing 32.6% to $0.35 per share from $0.26 a share in the same quarter of 2010. For the year, we also report gross -- record gross sales up 31% to $1,950,500,000. Record net sales up 30.6% to $1,703,200,000 and diluted earnings per share increasing 34.5% to $1.53 per share from $1.14 in the year ended December 31, 2010. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through January 21, 2012, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, excluding Wal-Mart, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including Shots, increased 16.4% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 23.6% in the 13-week period while sales of Red Bull increased by 18.7%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 19.1% and sales of 5-Hour increased by 14.3%. Sales of Amp decreased 7.2%. Sales of NOS increased 7%, but they're off a small base, and sales of Full Throttle decreased 4.5%.
 According to Nielsen reports for the 4 weeks ended January 21, 2012, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel, in dollars, increased by 16.8% over the comparable 4-week period in 2011. Sales of Monster increased by 26.9% over last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 18.1% over last year. Rockstar was up 18.6% while 5-Hour was up 9.9%. Amp was down 7%. NOS was up 8.3%, again off a small base, and Full Throttle was up 0.9%. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended January 21, 2012, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel including energy shots, in dollars, improved to 30.3% against Red Bull's share of 32.3%, Rockstar's share of 9.7% and 5-Hour's share of 10.6%. Based on the Nielsen reports, Monster is continuing to close the gap with Red Bull in dollars, while in units, Monster is continuing to increase its lead over Red Bull.
 According to Nielsen, in the 13 weeks ended January 21, 2012, all outlets combined, sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars increased 15.2% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 17% higher than last year and Starbucks Double Shot energy was up 21.3%. Java Monster sales and market share continues to show improvement and Java Monster is still the market leader in this space. We are pleased to report that sales of our new noncarbonated Monster Rehab Tea plus lemonade energy drink with electrolytes, which we launched in the first quarter of 2011 continues to accelerate, and this SKU continues to be one of our top-selling Monster products. Based on Nielsen data for the convenience and gas channel, in the 13 weeks ended January 21, 2012, sales of Rehab are now more than double the sales of the main competitive noncarbonated energy drink. 
 During the fourth quarter, we launched 3 line extensions through our successful Monster Rehab energy drink, namely Rojo Tea + Energy, Green Tea + Energy and ProTEAn + Energy. We're in the process of launching a further line extension in the Monster Rehab line namely Tea + Orangeades + Energy and also proceeding with our planned launch of Uber Monster Energy drinks in glass bottles during the first half of 2012. Monster is performing well in Canada. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended January 14, 2012, the energy drink category grew 11%. Monster sales increased 23% and our market share grew 2.3 points to 24.6% over the same period last year. Red Bull sales increased 11% and its market share decreased 0.2 points to 37.4% as compared to the same period last year over 2010. Rockstar sales increased 19%. Its market share increased by 0.9 points to 15%. 
 According to Nielsen, sales in the energy drink category in Mexico grew 11.4% in December 2011 over December 2010. Sales of Monster Energy in Mexico, in December 2011, grew 21.1% over the same month in 2010, while sales of Red Bull were 12.1% lower. Monster's market share in Mexico, December 2011, increased by 2.8 points to 34.2% over the same period in 2010. This excludes Java Monster, bringing it closer to Red Bull's market share in Mexico, which dropped to 9.8 points to 36.8% over the same period. Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 31.1% to $389.8 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2011, from $297.5 million in the same period in 2010. And contribution margin increased 24.9% from $103.7 million to $129.6 million. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment decreased 5.1% to $20.1 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2011, compared with $21.2 million for the same period in 2010. However, the company achieved a positive contribution of approximately $750,000 in the 3 months ended December 31, 2011, for the Warehouse segment, as compared to a negative contribution of almost $1 million in the comparable period in 2010. 
 Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 32.6% to $1,608,300,000 for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, from $1,212,600,000 in the same period in 2010, and contribution margin increased 24.4% from $436.7 million to $543.2 million. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment increased 4% to $94.9 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, compared with $91.3 million for the same period in 2010. And the Warehouse segment achieved a positive contribution margin of $4.3 million in the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, compared to a negative contribution of almost $0.8 million in 2010. 
 For the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, gross sales to retail groceries, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 4% of gross sales, down from 6% in 2010. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 10% of sales, down from 12% in 2010. Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 64% of sales, the same as in 2010. And gross sales, internationally, increased to 20% from 16% in the same period in 2010. Other sales were 2% for the period, the same as in 2010.
 Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the fourth quarter of 2011 amounted to $88.9 million compared to $66.4 million in the same quarter in 2010, and $116.8 million in the third quarter of 2011. Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, amounted to $381 million compared to $240.6 million in 2010. Included in such sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to their customers overseas. Sales continued to progress well in Europe. Gross sales in EMEA, which is Europe, Middle East and South Africa, were 46.1% higher in the fourth quarter than in the comparable period in 2010. And for the full year, gross sales in Europe were 87.5% higher than in 2010. Sales in Western Europe and in the United Kingdom, in particular, grew faster than in Central and Eastern Europe. And Western Europe is now operating profitably.
 In South Africa, we made a change to our distribution partner, and in the last quarter of 2011, sales improved substantially. We are continuing with our expansion strategy into new international markets. We launch Monster Energy in Poland in February and are planning new additional launches in Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan in the first half of 2012. We are also planning additional launches in Central and Eastern Europe, Turkey, the Middle East, Africa, South America, and Asia during the remainder of 2012. Both gross and net sales for the comparable 12-month period ended December 31, 2010 were negatively impacted by advanced purchases made by customers in the 2009 fourth quarter. If the sales attributable to the 2009 fourth quarter buy were being included in the 2010 first quarter in which the company previously estimated 4% to 6% of the 2009 fourth quarter growth sales, such sales would have had the effect of increasing the sales achieved in the 12 months ended December 31, 2010 by approximately 1%. The buying had no effect on 2011 sales in which we are now reporting.
 Sales of Peace Tea ready-to-drink iced tea continue to meet our expectations. In 2011, gross sales of Peace Tea increased 37.1% over 2010. We're in the process of launching 3 new line extensions, namely Cranberry Tea, Pink Lemonade + Tea and Texas Style Sweet Tea, which will replace the Ceylon Tea, Unsweetened Tea and Green Tea variants -- Dark Green Tea variants, sorry. We are continuing to build distribution for Worx Energy. In 2012, we intend to bring our advertising expenditure for Worx Energy into line with Worx sales levels. We plan to introduce an additional extra strength version later 2012.
 Gross profit margins achieved in the fourth quarter of 2011 was 52.3% versus 51.6% in the comparable quarter in 2010. The increase in our overall gross margin percentage was largely due to a higher proportion of sales within the DSD segment of products in North America, which have a higher gross profit margin; increased sales of DSD products as compared to Warehouse products; product mix, which was partially offset by international sales where we achieved lower gross margin than in North America; and to a lesser extent to lower off-invoice and promotional allowances. We have covered a large portion of our anticipated requirements for aluminum cans in 2012, as well as a portion of our anticipated requirements for apple juice and sugar. In the light of the volatility of both commodities in world markets, we anticipate some increase in raw material costs in 2012. We do not believe that, at current levels, raw material cost increases will have a material negative effect on our margins.
 Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales in the fourth quarter was a slightly higher than the same period in 2010. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 12.5% from 12.2% in the same period in 2010. The increase in selling expenses was primarily attributable to increases in commissions and royalty payments, premiums, advertising, and sponsorship and endorsement costs in the fourth quarter as compared to the same quarter in 2010. The increased cost for sampling teams, as well as trade development personnel, particularly in Europe, also contributed to the increase in selling expenses.
 We are continuing to invest in the Monster brand internationally, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, Australia and South America. Such trade development programs supplement our distribution partners respective sales forces to service and merchandise small independent stores. We believe that such activities play an important role in the establishment and development of our brand overseas. The cost of product sampling teams and trade development personnel are included as part of our selling expenses and do not form part of our payroll cost.
 General and administrative costs, although higher in dollars, decreased marginally as a percentage of net sales in the quarter. The increase in general and administrative cost was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses, and in particular, increased costs of stock-based compensation. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 12.9% from 11.5% in 2010. Sponsorship and endorsement costs were approximately $13.6 million higher than in 2010, but were lower as a percentage of net sales. Selling expenses for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011 was also higher than in 2010 primarily due to increased expenditures for advertising, which was largely for the Worx Energy Shots, trade development costs, commissions and royalties, premiums and merchandise displays which was mainly coolers. 
 In 2011, cost of goods as well as selling, general and administrative expenses in Western Europe were lower on a per case basis in local currencies than in 2010. In 2011, we invested extensively in Central and Eastern Europe, and more particularly, in newer markets in that region. Selling, general and administrative expenses in that region were higher on a per case basis in local currency in part due to lower case sales than planned. We are holding discussions with our distributor in Central Eastern Europe to more equitably allocate the value chain between us. We believe that such discussions, combined with reduced operating costs per case, will enable us to achieve improved operating results in 2012, in Central and Eastern Europe. We incurred higher promotional and marketing costs on a per case basis in Australia, in 2011, implementing our strategy to increase market share, which was achieved. We are working with our distributor in Australia to increase their contribution towards promotional costs going forward and have also taken steps to reduce our cost of goods and overall operating cost in Australia. We believe that these measures will enable us to achieve improved results in Australia in 2012.
 Operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, from our operations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australasia and, South America. These operating losses negatively affected our reported income for the 2011 year, and obviously, should be bore in mind in our evaluating results.
 Our effective tax rate in the 2011 fourth quarter was 38.3% compared to 38.7% in the 2010 fourth quarter. The decrease in the 2011 fourth quarter effective tax rate was primarily the result of a lower effective combined state tax rate, which was partially offset by an increase in the reserve for certain, uncertain tax benefits. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2011, was 37.4% compared to 39.3% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the year was primarily the result of a lower effective combined state tax rate this year and the establishment, in 2010, of a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary. The decrease in the annual effective tax rate was also partially offset by the increase in the reserve for certain, uncertain tax benefits.
 Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $359.3 million compared to $354.8 million at December 31, 2010. Short-term investments were $411.3 million compared to $244.6 million at December 31, 2010. Long-term investments decreased from $44.2 million at December 31, 2010 to $23.2 million. Included in short and long-term investments are auction rate securities of $35.9 million. Trade account receivables are now presented on a gross basis, as our promotional allowances owed to those customers that the company does not allow net settlement, such as our full-service distributors. We continue to present that portion of the promotional allowances owed to those customers that the company allows net settlement on a net basis. On such basis, trade account receivables increased to $218.1 million from $166 million at December 31, 2010. Days outstanding for receivables, consistent with the above treatment, were 42.4 days at December 31, 2011, compared to 41.3 days at December 31, 2010. If trade account receivables had been presented on a net basis, days outstanding would have been 26.2 days at December 31, 2011, compared to 27.7 days at December 31, 2010. In the future, the company will only report days outstanding for receivables calculated on a basis consistent with the above new treatment. As sales outside the United States continue to increase as a proportion of our overall sales, days outstanding for receivables are expected to increase due to the different terms generally granted to customers internationally in accordance with local practices in their respective countries.
 Inventories increased to $155.6 million from $153.2 million at December 31, 2010. Average days of inventory was 72 days at December 31, 2011, which is lower than the 89 days of inventory at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, the company held auction rate securities with a face value of $44.8 million, originally it was $79.6 million at December 31, 2010, with an amortized cost basis of $35.9 million. During the 2011 fourth quarter, the company purchased approximately 0.7 million shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $39.78 per share, pursuant to the share repurchase program previously authorized by the Board of Directors in March 2010. These purchases exhausted the availability under the 2010 share repurchase program. In the fourth quarter, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase plan for the repurchase of up to $250 million out of the company's shares. No shares have been purchased, as yet, under this authorization.
 Gross sales in January 2012 were approximately 34% higher than in January 2011. While we are encouraged by the continuing strong sales that have been experienced by the company, we caution, again, that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days of the week in which holidays fall at the timing of promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. I would like to open the floor to questions. 
 Thank you. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Kaumil Gajrawala with UBS. 
Kaumil Gajrawala: One quick clarification. When you were going through the numbers at the beginning, did you say that it was Central and Eastern Europe that went to profitability or were you talking about total Europe? 
Rodney Sacks: No. Western Europe, which includes the U.K., are more established markets, and by further bulk in that area, was profitable. It's the newer markets, and a lot of them are smaller countries in Central and Eastern Europe, that aren't profitable. A lot of that, as I indicated, and also just been more difficult because of startup costs in different countries, different languages. And just have overhead structures in each of those countries, which we have to establish and that Central and Eastern Europe has been the issue. 
Kaumil Gajrawala: Okay, got it. And then was there anything timing related? Sounds like in January you were up 54, that's significantly different with how the quarter was going. Anything that we should know about timing wise, that would explain that? 
Rodney Sacks: I'm not sure I follow that. I mean, the sales were up. The Nielsens, which were indicated with, for the last 4 weeks, were up in the high 20s. Our sales and ourselves as a company, which includes international is up 34% in January. So I'm not sure where that was... 
Kaumil Gajrawala: Okay. I just misheard you towards the end of that one. 
Rodney Sacks: To clarify, 3 4. 
Kaumil Gajrawala: 3 4, got it. 
Rodney Sacks: Yes. 
Kaumil Gajrawala: And then the final thing is how far along are you in some of the international markets where you're close to profitability? Is there a certain size in terms of revenues, a certain area all of a sudden scale starts to kick in? 
Rodney Sacks: I think there is a clear correlation between the size of the market and our profitability. In most of the Western European countries, we're already at a size where we are profitable in each of those countries, individually, as well as in aggregate for the region. In Central and Eastern Europe, there are certain countries in that region where we have reached a level of profitability already, even though those are much newer markets, and those are the markets that are bigger. It's just much harder to get going in small market where you may have 100,000 cases or 120,000 cases in your second year to be profitable. Where you've got a country manager, you have a sampling team, a truck and marketing people. You do need to get up to a certain scale and be -- it's just been harder in Central and Eastern Europe because the energy category in those countries is smaller and it's just taking a little longer to get up to that mass. But it is going in the right direction. 
Kaumil Gajrawala: Okay. And then just my final question is with very impressive growth despite the fact that the economy had not turned around, maybe at the pace which we would have preferred. Do you feel that maybe you're starting to see a bit of a cyclical benefit, that maybe the macro-environment is getting a little bit better for your core consumer? 
Rodney Sacks: I think it's been very much, much less -- I mean, a lot of our core consumers are still struggling. And for example, in California, where the housing market hasn't come back yet. So we've not seen a big change that sort been -- materially, in anyway. I mean, the results of just the been -- continue to be good. The category is still growing and a lot of that we ascribe to the broadening demographic. And we've been fortunate to see growth even though we've -- obviously, we're having tough economic times, generally, in the U.S. and elsewhere. But we don't see a big change. 
Operator: Your next question is from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. 
Judy Hong: Rodney, I think I missed your answer to Kaumil's question. But the January sales, you said up 54 or 34? 
Rodney Sacks: No, 34. 3 4, 34%. 
Judy Hong: 34%. Okay, got it. And then maybe just -- if you can help us understand the Rehab performance. How big is that brand now as a percent of your business? And as you build out traditional SKUs, I think you were hoping that you can get into tea doors and how successful are you in that endeavor? 
Rodney Sacks: Rehab in -- this is January, I'm trying to get you some figures. In January, Rehab is -- January and February, Rehab has been about between 5% and 6%, that's just the original Rehab. Between 5% and 6% of our sales. And we're rolling off the Red and the Green Tea Rehab and the others, and so that is a little bit distorted in January and February because a lot of that is part 4. But in the quarter, the fourth quarter, Rehab's sales were about -- gross sales, I don't have a net number, Judy, gross sales were about $47 million. So that, you can see is quite a big number, it's -- of our total net sales, were about -- I'm sorry, that's gross. Our total gross sales in the quarter was about -- adjusted, it was about -- in that division was about $467 million. So the company is $467 million. So you can see -- which is 10% of our sales. And if you go to the -- and in the convenience and gas -- basically in the convenience and gas channel, if you take our leading Green product, which is the main product, our sales that were -- the retail sales, $118 million for the 13 weeks ending January 21. Rehab, it -- growing up to about $23.5 million. If you bear that in mind Absolutely Zero is off to another year -- being in the market for 1 3/4 year, that's $27.4 million and our low carb is about $39 million. So those are the -- sort of the -- that's sort of positioning of it our mix. 
Judy Hong: And your success in terms of getting additional -- in your entry into tea door, which we have now [ without ] additional SKUs. Are you able to get more shelf spaces and get into tea door now? 
Rodney Sacks: Get into? We're right in the middle of getting sets, resets, and not able to -- we're getting immediate acceptance for all of our additional SKUs. But I'm not aware of exactly how, what proportion of our sales are going into the energy door or actually being successful in transitioning into the tea door. It's premature for me, both. 
Judy Hong: Okay. And then just in terms of your G&A expenses in the quarter, just to the sequential step up. I think in Q3, if you take out the options expense, it's just up by about $3 million just quarter-to-quarter. So is that just adding more people in some of the international markets? What drove that sequential pickup in terms of the actual dollar increase in G&A? 
Rodney Sacks: I think one of the things that was up was stock-based compensation. And then we are also up with additional people. I mean, as we've continued to expand the rollout into -- and planning for -- our launches took place earlier this month. The launch that is coming up quite quickly in Korea. In Japan, we've led to take on additional staff, and so we are gearing to do the same thing in South America. So we certainly have had an increase in staffing and we have taken on a new Senior Vice President, Don Blaustein, who was previously President of Heineken to head up our international operations in Asia and South America regions, and Lat-Am regions. He's come on board. But he won't have affected these figures because he's come on board only in the last few weeks. But we are obviously, looking to step up our personnel to basically be able to handle the increased expansion, the bigger volume that we're now dealing with as we continue to move forward. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. 
William Chappell: Just a couple of quick questions around gross margin, kind of looking at a pretty strong gross margin in the fourth quarter. Trying to understand if that's more mix or if that's the benefit of the hedges and how we should look at that if that's kind of the base we should look at going forward into 2012? 
Rodney Sacks: I think that's more of a mix issue. I think the Rehab is continuing to increase as a proportion and the margins on the Rehab brand are better than some of the juice products, the coffee product, some of the bigger can sizes. So I think that is primarily a mix result. 
William Chappell: Okay. And then looking to 2012. I know you said that commodities shouldn't be a negative for gross margin, how about the entry into a lot of the Asian, Eastern Europe countries in the first half. Should they have any material impact on that gross margin or should be at least flat look ahead? 
Rodney Sacks: I think that, as we've indicated, the overseas business, generally, gross margins are not as good as we've been achieving in the North American markets. So as we continue to grow sales in those markets, we're obviously trying to improve our efficiencies and our cost. But the gross margins are, as a general rule, not -- there are some exceptions, but as a general rule, will be less. But again, the impact that those additional markets will have on the company, we believe will be small. The issue, which we don't know a lot about is as we continue to expand, again, is what will happen to cost like the bigger cost that we have, our apple juice and sugar, which are quite big components, as we've indicated -- as indicated earlier. We've largely covered our aluminum can side. But we do have -- we've got a reasonable proportion of our juice and sugar cost all uncovered. So those may go up as we see the year. But we don't think that the increase -- there'll be an increase but we don't think it'll be material. 
Operator: And our next question is from Caroline Levy with CLSA. 
Michael Lavery: This is a Michael Lavery on behalf of Caroline. Just looking at the International business. Could you talk a little bit about how, where you are now compared to where you hope to be, and I know you mentioned expanding into Poland. But you've had a lot of quarters with a long list of countries that you've started into. And so what's left? I know you've got some moves in Asia coming, but are you getting a good read just compared to where you expect to be? Is it just a question of those markets maturing more now and developing or -- what's the right way to think about the trajectory there? 
Rodney Sacks: So if we take Europe -- generally, Western Europe, we pretty much have full distribution. We think that we're looking at making, relooking at the Italian market. We think there's lot of opportunity. I think we're underrepresented in the Italian market. We have opportunity there. Some of the markets are starting to grow very nicely. We think we have a lot of growth left in markets like Spain, Germany and the U.K. where the brand is doing very, very nicely and in France, for that matter. Those are pretty big markets. In Central and Eastern Europe, we are looking at some additional markets which are quite large. Poland is probably the second largest market in Central and Eastern Europe. And in fact if you exclude Russia, it's the largest market, but certainly just after Russia. And that is a very big market in relation to some of the other smaller markets that we have gone into. Hungary was a nice market but they imposed a tax on energy drinks and anything with sugar. And that really has completely disrupted that market. So that is part of the sort of challenges we had this year. And the fall off in the fourth quarter was largely attributable to -- in sales in that area was attributable to that issue. But the Czech market is doing very nicely. So there are markets that are doing very nicely and will continue to grow. We think that we do have some expansion there. The Asian markets, we are looking at some pretty nice sized market in Korea and Japan. There are a couple of the smaller ones, that I indicated, which will be our smaller markets. And we're continuing to expand.
 We believe, that we have a lot of upside and the Brazilian market, particularly in the other markets in South America where we're at -- we're pretty far advanced in having our products approved through -- meeting the regulatory requirements and in having planning -- launches planned. We've already started trade in Colombia very nicely and we're looking at Peru, Ecuador, Chile, and Argentina. So we believe those will also come on stream in the foreseeable future. And each of these markets just basically have their own maturity as you get to a certain size in the market, you're able to actually profitably support the infrastructure we need in these markets. The way we do business going into markets with a lot of support for sampling and for those sort of local marketing activities. And so once we get over the initial hump, the markets start becoming more profitable quite quickly and you know we've just paid our dues in a lot of the Central and Eastern European  markets and we are hopeful that we will continue to get better results in those countries this year. 
Michael Lavery: Well, that's very helpful, thanks. And one last one, I'm sorry if I might have missed you say that, I just didn't catch it. But how are you tracking quarter-to-date on shipments so far? Because I know you've got a funny comparison with last year. What does that look like through the first few weeks, first half of the quarter? 
Rodney Sacks: Well, we have indicated the figure was, in January, was 34% higher. 
Michael Lavery: And that's on a shipment basis? 
Rodney Sacks: That's on a shipment basis, correct. And we're still in the middle of Feb. It's moving in the right and it's on a good trajectory but it's very early in the month. 
Operator: That's the Q&A portion for the conference. I'll like turn the call back over to Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO for closing comments. 
Rodney Sacks: Thank you very much. Thanks very much. I know that our conference call seems to have interfered with the CAGNY conference. But thanks very much for taking the time to attend the call. We're pretty excited by the results that we've continued to be able to achieve with the brand, the continued expansion of the brand, increase of sales and profitability in the U.S. and North American markets. And the overseas markets have taken a little bit of time to get going but they are starting to put into place now. We are seeing some really nice increases in market share and results coming out of Western Europe. And so we are pretty encouraged by that factor. You just got to have a bit of patience. Things don't happen in a day. But we really are excited, going forward, by the gross sales that we've achieved in January. And I'll repeat that we are very, very encouraged by our Rehab brand. The whole line is going very well. It's been very well received by buyers and customers, as well as the consumer feedback we've heard is very, very positive for that line. So we're looking forward to having a good year this year and thank you for your support. Thank you. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in the Monster Beverage Corporation Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2011 Financial Results Conference Call. This does conclude the program. And you may now disconnect. Thank you and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Hansen Natural Corporation Third Quarter 2011 Financial Results Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. And now, I'll turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Rodney Sacks. Please begin.
Rodney C. Sacks: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President is with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance, and trends. Management caution that these statements are based on management's current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made herein. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2011, and our most recent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, including the sections contained therein entitled, Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measures of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the consolidated -- Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Other Information attached to the earnings release dated November 3, 2011. A copy of this information is also available on our website, www.hansens.com, in the Investor Relations Section.  We are pleased to report yet again another record third quarter with record gross sales up 25% to $548.1 million, record net sales up 24.4% to $474.7 million and with diluted earnings per share increasing 23.3% to $0.88 per share from $0.72 in the same quarter of last year. Although the macro consumer environment in our major markets, particularly the United States and Europe, continues to remain under pressure, it is encouraging that both Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola Enterprises reported improved revenues for the third quarter in the United States and European markets.  Even more encouraging is the continued growth that we have seen in the Energy Drink category for the third quarter, which, according to Nielsen, continues to grow in the mid-teens with sales of Monster Energy continuing to outperform the growth of the category. We believe our ability to achieve continued growth this quarter demonstrates our ability to leverage the significant opportunities available to the Monster brand, including innovation, improved distribution and execution.  We continue to focus on innovation and introducing new products to the marketplace. Initial response to the introduction of Monster M3, which is a super-concentrated Monster Energy drink in 5-ounce glass bottles, has been positive, and we are encouraged about the future for this product. We are currently shipping out 3 new line extensions to Monster Rehab, which have been well received by consumers and distributors in the United States. These line extensions comprised of Rojo Tea + Energy, Green Tea + Energy and ProTEAn, a non-carbonated protein drink with 15 grams of protein per can.  At the recent -- the National Association of Convenience Stores show in Chicago, the Rehab line extensions received a positive reception from many retailers and distributors. At the next show, we also unveiled our new uber Monster Energy drink, which is an ultra-premium, nonalcoholic, brewed energy drink, crafted with a fermented malt base, which we are planning to launch in 2012 in 16.9-ounce glass bottles with a huge pry-off crown closure.  According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through September 24, 2011, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, excluding Wal-Mart, sales in dollars in the Energy Drink category, including Shots, increased 15.1% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 22.4% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 14.8%, sales of Rockstar increased by 20.6%, sales of 5-Hour increased by 18.5%, sales of Amp decreased 8.1%, sales of NOS increased 7.9% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 11.2%.  According to the Nielsen reports, for the 5 weeks ended September 24, 2011, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel, in dollars, increased by 14.1% over the comparable 5-week period in 2010. Sales of Monster increased by 24.1% over last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 13.3% over last year. Rockstar was up 18.6%, while 5-Hour was up 9.6%. Amp was down 3.9%. NOS was up 6.7%, and Full Throttle was down 9.2%.  According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended September 24, 2011, Monster's market share of the Energy Drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars improved to 30.4% against Red Bull share of 31.8%, Rockstar share of 9.9% and 5-Hour share of 10%. Based on the Nielsen reports, Monster is continuing to close the gap with Red Bull in dollars, while in units Monster is continuing to increase its lead over Red Bull.  According to Nielsen, in the 13 weeks ended September 24, 2011, all outlets combined, sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars increased 10.5% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 13.5% higher than last year, and Starbucks Double Shot Energy was up 16.2%. However, our net sales of the Java Monster line to our customers in the third quarter were approximately 23.3% higher than in the comparable quarter of 2010. Java Monster sales and market share continues to show improvement.  Sales of our new non-carbonated Monster Rehab energy drink with electrolytes and additional supplements, which we launched in the first quarter, continues to accelerate, and Rehab has become one of our top-selling Monster products. Based on Nielsen data for the 13 weeks ended September 24, 2011, it appears that sales of Rehab have increased, such that Rehab sales are nearly double those of the main competitive non-carbonated energy drink.  As indicated above, we are in the process of launching 3 line extensions to our Monster Rehab line, and we are also planning to introduce a fourth line extension to the Monster Rehab line in 2012. The company is continuing with its strategy to expand the Monster Energy brand into new international markets, with additional launches in South America, Central and Eastern Europe and Asia planned for the near future.  Monster continues to perform well in Canada. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended September 24, 2011, the Energy Drink category grew 6%. Monster sales increased 5%, but its market share decreased by 0.2 points from 25.5% in the same period last year, due primarily to an aggressive "buy 1 get 1 free" promotion and a sweepstakes promotion by certain major retailers in the comparable quarter last year, which were not repeated this quarter. Red Bull sales increased 9%, and its market share increased by 1.2 points to 38.7%, while Rockstar sales increased 3%. It's market share decreased by 0.4 points to 13.5%.  According to Nielsen, sales in the Energy Drink category in Mexico grew 14.6% in August 2011 over last year. Sales of Monster Energy in Mexico in August 2011 grew 37.4% over last year, while sales of Red Bull were 13.9% lower. Monster's market share in Mexico in August 2011 increased by 6.2 points to 37.3% over the same period last year, excluding Java Monster, resulting in Monster being the leading energy brand in Mexico. Red Bull's market share in Mexico dropped 11.8 points to 35.5% over the same period.  Sales continued to progress satisfactorily in the United Kingdom and continental Europe. Net sales in Europe in the third quarter of 2011, in dollars, were approximately 89.6% higher than in the same period last year. Both cost of goods and general and administrative expenses in Europe were lower in the third quarter than the comparable quarter of 2010, on a per-case basis in local currencies, while filling expenses were higher on a per-case basis.  While Western Europe is now operating profitably, we still incurred operating losses in Central and Eastern Europe, where our brand is continuing to get established in those markets. We have been satisfied with our recent launches at Monster Energy in Greece, Cyprus and the Baltic States, as well as in Colombia in South America.  As previously reported, both gross and net sales for the comparative first 9-month period of 2010 were negatively impacted by bonds purchases made by customers in the 2009 fourth quarter, due to our announcement of a new per-case marketing contribution program for Monster Energy distributors, which commenced on January 1, 2010, as well as to avoid potential interruptions in product supply due to our announcement to transition to the SAP enterprise resource planning system in January 2010.  If sales attributable to the 2009 fourth quarter buy-in had been included in the 2010 first quarter, with the company previously estimated at approximately 4% to 6% of 2009 fourth quarter sales, such sales would have moderated the percentage increase in net sales that we achieved in the first 9 months of 2011, from 31.3% to 28.8%. The buy-in had no effect on the results for the 2011 third quarter on which we are now reporting.  During the quarter, our distributor in Hungary purchased increased volumes of Monster in anticipation of the introduction of a new tax in Hungary. We estimate that the advanced buy-in at the end of the quarter was not material.  During the third quarter, on a consolidated basis, we incurred higher selling expenses as a percentage of net sales, primarily due to increased sponsorships, advertising, merchandise displays and premiums, as well as, largely in Europe, increased trade development costs and sampling programs.  During the third quarter of 2011, we continued to add TV advertising to promote our Worx Energy brand, but with a new TV advertisement. Such advertising increased selling expenses as a percentage of net sales by approximately 0.6% of a percent in the quarter. While we are seeing improved consumer response to our Worx Energy brand, sales are still not meeting our expectations. We've now received confirmation of listings for Worx in certain of the largest convenience store chains in the United States, which are anticipated to commence sales during the fourth quarter. While Worx distribution levels have improved, they remained at unacceptably low levels.  Gross sales in October 2011 are approximately 31.1% higher than in October 2010. We cautioned again that sales in a single month are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period.  For the 3 months ended September 30, 2011, sales to retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 4% of gross sales, down from 5% last year. Sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 11% of sales, down from 13% last year. Sales to full-service distributors represented 62% of sales, down from 63% last year. Sales outside the United States increased to 21% from 16% in the same period last year. Other sales were 2% compared with 3% last year.  Peace Tea ready-to-drink ice tea has continued to improve. Gross sales of Peace Tea increased 19.9% over the comparable quarter last year. Gross sales in the warehouse division were marginally lower by 1.3%, from $32 million to $31.5 million, but net sales in this division increased by 11.6%, from $24.7 million to $27.6 million.  Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the third quarter of 2011 amounted to $116.8 million compared to $69.8 million in the same quarter last year, increasing 67.4% over the same period last year. Included in such sales are sales for the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and then shipped to the military and their customers overseas. Gross profit margin achieved in the third quarter was 52.7% this quarter versus 51.9% in the same quarter last year. We managed to improve gross profit margin in the third quarter due primarily to product mix.  We do not believe that at current levels, raw material cost increases will have a material negative effect on our margins. As previously indicated, our sugar and apple juice concentrate costs have largely been covered for this year.  Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales in the third quarter were lower than the same period last year. We're continuing to benefit from increased efficiencies in this area. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 12.6% from 11% in the same quarter last year for the reasons described earlier.  We have increased the number of trade development sales personnel and sampling staff in Europe generally, and in Australia and elsewhere, to merchandise and call on small independent stores in countries in which our distribution partners do not operate complete full-service direct store delivery system. While we expect such activities to increase operating costs, primarily in Europe and Australia, we continue to believe that such programs, which contributed to our success in the United States, will enable us to reach small independent stores and increase awareness for the brand. As we continue to believe that these activities are an important component to the long-term development of the brand, the associated costs are allocated to selling expenses as opposed to payroll costs.  General and administrative cost for the third quarter, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 7.9% from 8.1% in the same period last year, primarily due to lower payroll costs as a percentage of net sales.  Operating losses in the third quarter of 2011 in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Australia and Brazil, combined, were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2010, primarily due to a substantial increased operating losses incurred by us in the newer launched markets in Central and Eastern Europe, specifically Austria and Switzerland, where sales were lower than had been anticipated, in large part, due to various operational issues on the part of our distributor and the introduction in Austria of a very cheap, private-label energy drinks. We are working together with our distributor to address the operational issues, but continued with planned expenditures during the quarter to build awareness for the Monster brand in those key countries. Operating results for Western Europe in the third quarter of 2011 improved moderately over the comparable quarter in 2010.  Our effective tax rate for the quarter ended September 30, 2011, was 37.2%, compared to 38.1% for the third quarter of 2010 and 39.3% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the third quarter 2011 compared to the third quarter of 2010 was primarily the result of a lower, effective, combined state tax rate. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2011 as compared to the year-end 2010 rate was attributable to an increase in the tax benefits from the establishment of a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary established during the second fiscal quarter of 2010.  Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $287.2 million, compared to $354.8 million at December 31, 2010. Short-term investments, however, were $412.3 million, compared to $244.6 million at December 31, 2010. Trade account receivable net increased to $139 million from $101.2 million at December 31, 2010.  Day sales outstanding for receivables were 25.6 days at September 30, 2011, compared to 29.7 days at September 30, 2010, and 27.7 days at December 31, 2010. As sales outside the United States continue to increase as a proportion of our overall sales, days outstanding for receivables are expected to increase due to the different terms generally granted to customers internationally, in accordance with local practices in their respective countries.  Inventories increased to $164.5 million from a $153.2 million at December 31, 2010. Average days of inventory were 66 days at September 30, 2011, which is lower than the 89.4 days of inventory at December 31, 2010.  At September 30, 2011, the company have auction rate securities with a face value of $48.6 million, with $79.6 million at December 31, 2010, with an amortized cost bases of $39.4 million. During the third quarter, the company exercised its put option to sell $13.6 million of its auction rate securities. For the 3 months ended September 30, 2011, the company had a net expense of approximately $0.8 million in respect to the company's auction rate securities and related put options.  During the 2011 third quarter, the company purchased 1.4 million shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $77.4 per share under the share purchase -- repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors in 2010. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the company purchased an additional 0.3 million shares at an average purchase price of $79.56 per share, which exhausted the availability under the 2010 share repurchase program. In October 2011, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program to purchase up to $250 million of the company's outstanding common stock.  I would like to open the floor to questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Bill Chappell of SunTrust.
Michael Swartz: This is actually Mike Swartz filling in for Bill. Yes, first question, I just wanted to touch on the selling expense, came in a lot higher than we expected and significant increase year-over-year. You touched on some of the drivers of that, but could you dig into that a little more? What was the largest driver on a year-to-year basis? And was there any kind of -- or anything pulled forward?
Rodney C. Sacks: I'm not sure what you mean by pulled forward. I mean, interests were incurred in the correct periods. But the largest -- it just depends on when we signed contracts. When the contracts are -- when they run in, we obviously expense the amount we incur under sponsorship agreements when the contracts are due to be performed. And sometimes the contracts run year round, sometimes the contracts run over shorter periods of time. The largest driver of the increase was the increase in sponsorships and endorsements. The next largest in dollar terms was advertising, which was attributable to basically to Worx, the advertising for Worx, which obviously, last year, was very low because it hadn't really kicked in and went up during this year. If you add the math program and trade development -- allocated trade development costs together, they will probably come in between the sponsorship and advertising. So it depends how you break it down. If you allocate them separately, therefore, lower down them. But if you allocate them as a joint thing -- and that was a -- primarily attributable to those costs, which were -- the increase in those cost were primarily incurred in Europe, wherein in developing markets we have basically increased our T.D.M. program and having -- and have met teams in each of these countries. And initially, the issue is that when you start up with a single MAT team, it's a truck, with a MAT leader and a number of stuff. And you go out in the country and in these -- some of the smaller countries, you really need some presence. So you have a MAT team and the cost of being incurred to run and operate that team. But for a while, until your sales start kicking in, the cost of that MAT team becomes obviously high per case, and then starts lowering as you go forward, as it's now starting to lower in many of the countries in Western Europe, where the sales are much higher. But you start off and then you have that, sort of that, out of balance cost. And then also because of the number of countries that we've launched in, in Europe, you have MAT teams -- because of distances that really has to be in each countries. So you'll have a MAT teams in Prague. You'll have a MAT team in Slovakia. You have a MAT team in Hungary. But because they can't keep driving these trucks, even if though couple of hundred miles every day or every week, to attend different events. So you've got 3 MAT teams, for example, in those basically 3 small -- reasonably small countries. So that was the next expense. And then other expenses that were higher were merchandise display premiums, merchandise displays -- those sort of costs that we incurred.
Michael Swartz: Yes, that's great. That helps a lot. And then second question. I mean, any kind of update on the Asian expansion? I think we had anticipated hearing something sooner rather than later on that front. And when should we actually...
Rodney C. Sacks: We are working towards launching. Probably the first market that we're going to be launching in is in Korea, and then we're planning to launch in Japan. Japan has been -- in South Korea. But Japan has been a -- was part of this -- we started planning a lot before Korea, but it's just taking a lot more planning with our distribution partner there. They're just very much more cautious about everything, about inspecting the -- every production site, every -- getting every ingredient analyzed, and say, it just -- it's a long process. But we will be getting -- moving, if we -- we're sort of moving these balls down the line again. Getting products improved, even in Korea, has been a challenge, because until now, they have not really permitted any energy drinks containing caffeine in Korea and South Korea. So we've had some relaxation on how to get products approved in Korea that still have efficacy, which we've done now and -- but there have been some hiccups. Red Bull just recently launched in Korea, got some shipments in, then had shipments placed on hold and had empty shelves and then had to have debates with the authorities about formulations and reformulations. And we have had an approval for our products, and we're now in the course of planning the actual launch. We're also looking at some other markets and are having some discussions with potential distribution partners. We did have discussions with one group, and that has eventually didn't move forward. And we are sort of making other plans and moving forward in Asia, but really, it'll be a much more visible in 2012.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeff Farmer of Jefferies.
Jeffrey D. Farmer - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: I was just looking for some more color on your domestic volumes. Are you driving growth for same-store sales or distribution gains still playing a big role for you?
Rodney C. Sacks: I think there have been some distribution gains, and particularly, in sort of some of the extended product, deeper product lines, but same-store sales have also -- and sales to a point, have also increased. For example are sales per point of our very original Green Monster energy drink in the convenience channel are up 10.7% year-on-year for the same product. So we are seeing some gains in distribution and some gains in the actual selling rates of the individual products.
Jeffrey D. Farmer - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: So that 10.7% number would include Monster Rehab, so it's sort of a brand extension of Monster...
Rodney C. Sacks: No, no. I'm just giving you one SKU, Monster Green 16-ounce.
Jeffrey D. Farmer - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Got you. Okay, that's helpful. And then just following up on the distribution point. As it relates to additional white space in the country, are there pockets of low STV [ph]? Is there still a lot of distribution opportunity out there for the brand?
Rodney C. Sacks: We think, there is. If you take the distribution metrics, we basically -- if you take it across the 3 main channels, which is convenience and gas, grocery and drug, the biggest one is convenience. But pretty much if you take all 3, our distribution level for Monster Green 16 ounce is 91%. It's 88% for local of Monster 16-ounce, then drops to 69% for Absolutely Zero, 58% for Rehab. Those are the 2 of the newer ones that have -- got production -- sorry, got distribution over the last year to 18 months. And then many of the other ones of our products are sort of -- are down at 50%. So we believe we -- if we improve our distribution as we continue to strive for that in many of the markets where distribution is obviously better than the others, we do have opportunity in the U.S. -- just continue to fill out. If you take the, basically, the convenience market, and you look at those numbers, it goes 97%, 90%, 76%, 73%. So there is a clear depth, which we believe we could improve on, on some of the supporting SKUs, which are still very good SKUs. And that's in 16 ounce. We still have a lot of, again, also distribution opportunities in products like our 24-ounce, which is pretty much the #2 or 3 best-selling product store. And the #2 -- that's at 71%, the 24-ounce Green Monster. SO we believe we do have a lot of opportunity still in the U.S.
Operator: Our next question is from Mark Astrachan of Stifel, Nicolaus.
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I guess, couple questions. One, on the share repurchase. So that was obviously a pretty big number. Is it fair to assume that there's a bit of a shift now in strategy in terms of your cash use? Meaning that you haven't done a whole lot with it over the years, and this may now be a better option on a going-forward basis to use that cash. I mean, I guess like -- give us a bit of color in terms of what you think you're going to do with the cash going forward. If this is basically it or if there's other opportunities.
Rodney C. Sacks: No. I mean, we just keep an open mind. We believe we've always kept an open mind and simply it’s been a factor of looking at opportunities, just considering our use of cash. We -- the amount of cash we have has continued to increase, and so we’ve just probably been highered to sort of the levels at which we've purchased shares. We may be -- may have been a little more conservative, just in the way we implemented the program historically, whereas now we probably gave more leeway to the buyers in implementing our programs. And they were able to obviously secure more. So in many cases, we did implement programs and perhaps were too tight in the way we manage them. And the amounts we bought were smaller and just -- we've just loosened it up a little bit. But I don't think there's been a fundamental change. All agree, we're still -- we'd look at opportunities, and we have the power to do so if the right opportunities came along or continue to buy shares. We’ve just felt that with the focus on Monster, and still seeing the growth we have been able to achieve, as you've seen for many years now. With Monster in the U.S., domestically and internationally, we just feel that probably we're comfortable just growing those brands. At the same time, we do look at other opportunities that we, ourselves, can develop without paying big -- premiums for them, like Peace Tea. We think that we've managed to successfully create a great brand in Peace Tea. It's not showing on the bottom line yet, but the fact is that the brand is selling nicely. It's up on last year. We are expanding the -- into a larger-size containers now, in plastic. And we believe that will continue to do well for us, both as an asset that we've created as a brand and also able to start contributing to profits, and we believe that's a more sensible way to go about creating value. And with the combination of the buybacks that has been our --- we are looking at that a little more focused now. But otherwise, it's pretty much the same theory.
Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And then just from a housekeeping standpoint. So G&A expenses continue to creep up, and I'm not talking the sampling merchandising, advertising piece of it. Is -- at some point, are these going to sort of normalize? I know there have been some legal expenses in there. I know they've got the option expenses in there. But like at some point, like do they stop growing, or do they start growing less than sales? And then sort of related to that, like from a Worx expense standpoint, I know that was a big number, the 0.6% of sales in the third quarter. Is that going to be a smaller number in the fourth quarter and into 2012, given that you have had limited success with the brand?
Rodney C. Sacks: I think that it's going to balance out. As a company, overall, our G&A really was lower as a percentage of sales than our -- than last year. So that did improve. Probably that was partially offset by some high-end G&A costs in Europe again, particularly Central and Eastern Europe where it got a little bit skewed, costs of travel and things of that nature, especially when we're establishing bands in so many small countries. We're disproportionately high. We've look at that, and there were things I can't -- obviously, I mentioned travel, because that is very high in Europe. It's hard to fly around from country to country. It's hard to travel. And those costs -- it was something we now just and took -- have obviously dealt with, with our guys out there. But those are costs that are incurring. We believe those will eventually normalize as we continue to basically fill in the European territory, and sales start growing in Central, Eastern Europe, just as they have done in Western Europe. And then it will become a smaller proportion of our G&A as we go to newer countries, obviously that once we've obviously, I think, normalize the Europe and America, because those are your 2 main basis, we think, for energy drinks.
Operator: Our next question is from Alton Stump of Longbow Research.
Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: If you could just talk about the profitability situation in overseas, in Europe mainly. As looking at the next year, have you any plans for the region, as a whole, as -- if we'll see any meaningful profitability show up?
Rodney C. Sacks: I just didn't -- I just couldn't hear the last part of your question. Sorry, you weren't very clear.
Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: Sure. If you think that the region of Europe will be profitable next year or not.
Rodney C. Sacks: If you take Europe, as a whole, I'd don't know. Because we aren’t -- they're really at very, very immature, early stages in some of these countries. We have a number of a reasonably large countries that we're about to launch, and we may well be able to pick up some volumes and leverage the overhead we have already established across those volumes. And hopefully, we -- the issues we face in Austria and Switzerland will start sort of disappearing as we continue to slowly get out, spending in line more and our sales go up. So I hope that Europe, as a whole, will possibly be positive and contribute. I think we're more comfortable with Western Europe continuing to improve their profitability and their contribution, but I'm not sure exactly what effect Eastern Europe will have. And one of those reasons is we're not sure exactly which country we'll be launching in and when that will affect those numbers ultimately. We are going through our planning now for launching in different countries, newer countries in Eastern Europe, and a lot of that will be taken once we finalized those results. I just can't give you a more definite answer on that.
Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: Okay, that's helpful. And then just one quick follow-up on the metal can cost front. Any ideas, at this point, as to whether we'll see any meaningful cost decline for cans next year?
Hilton H. Schlosberg: We may -- this is Hilton, Alton. We may -- we're evaluating the aluminum situation, and we'll decide when it will make sense to cover or not to cover this year. We've recovered a portion in the early part of the year and left ourselves open, which actually proved to be quite beneficial to the company. What happens in 2012, I don't know. But at current aluminum levels, we should show some improvement in 2012 on 2011, assuming we do decide to cover at these levels.
Operator: Our next question is from John Faucher of JPMorgan.
John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Coke and CCE, you talked a little bit about some trade down with an energy, I think more on Western Europe, particularly maybe volume moving out of the small can businesses into the larger can businesses, which obviously would help you guys. Can you talk a little bit about whether you're seeing any of that, and sort of what plans you have in place to take advantage if we continue to see some trade down like that in Europe?
Rodney C. Sacks: I'm not sure I understand the trade down term you're using, John. But one of the reasons you're seeing some switching in Europe to the larger can size is because we're actually selling more. We're becoming a more -- a larger portion of the energy drink business landscape. Now Red Bull has some -- some business have gone in countries to some of the larger sizes as well. Rockstar is doing some business there. There often are some local brands, where they may be in a mixture between 25 and 50. Most of the private-label products are -- or are in 25, 250 ml, 25 cc, where they are very, very cheap. The biggest challenge we have in Europe is the private-label brand, which are sort of taking the share of the bottom end part of the market. And the retailers there are pretty powerful, so they really do promote their own store brands. But the switch to larger sizes is really, I think, being fueled by our own products and the Rockstar there and a little bit in the U.K. by Relentless.
John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. So you don't see it as any sort of economic issue. You see it similar to what we saw in the U.S., let's say, 4 or 5 years ago, when consumers just simply started making that choice to go to brands that came in larger cans?
Rodney C. Sacks: Larger cans and -- there are 2 reasons for that. It's not just because there's a larger can. I think what we've done is, I think, what you do with a larger can is provide consumers with the -- with value, with premium products. So they don't necessarily go into the cheap products. So you're giving them a premium product, which makes them feels good about the purchase, but you're giving them better value, which is I -- we think, an advantage. But also, what we've been able to do is we are expanding our product line. It's not as broad, for example, in Europe as in the U.S. But we're also giving consumers a bigger choice, and that's something they really never had before. And that, I think, is also fueling some of the switch to our product and to the larger sized. So we just don't offer our product in a smaller size. So if somebody wants a juice-based energy drink, which they've really not had the opportunity to have until now, they have to buy the larger size because that's all that's really available.
Operator: Our next question is from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Rodney, I know the month-to-month sales trends can be pretty volatile. But just the 31% growth that you saw in October, if there's any color just in terms of U.S. versus international, or any timing factor that you could call out at this point?
Rodney C. Sacks: No. I think international is still continuing to perform pretty nicely, in line with the last quarter where they -- their results were -- we believe in sales were very good. We obviously had the cost issues in Eastern Europe, but on a sales level they’ve continuing -- we're continuing to see the same trends. And overall, the -- just the market was decent in the U.S. But again, either upwards or sometimes when it's a little lower, we caution it's a single month. It just depends on where -- when buying comes in, when deliveries are made, when holiday's fall. There are many factors, and we don't have that color. It's -- for us, the fact that it's 5% above or 6% above the average for the third quarter is not sufficiently noticeable to make -- to us, to really see that it's attributable to any one or more specific things that we can put our finger on. It's just generally across the board -- good volume. Things like Rehab are continuing to get traction. That part of the business, which I referred to in my earlier part on my call, is clearly getting a lot of good traction. And so we're very -- obviously, we're positive about the line extensions that we're going to start introducing into the fourth quarter and going forward.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then just in terms of Java Monster, you talked about the improvement that you're seeing on that brand. And if I look at the Nielsen, that I clearly show that the brands now back to growing, I don't know, 20%-plus kind of level. We've been -- the c-stores that we track. So can you maybe help us understand some of the things that you've sort of tweaked around with that's driving that improvement? Is there more ACB growth opportunities there? Maybe just a little bit more update on the Java trends?
Rodney C. Sacks: I think there actually is some distribution opportunities. It's a question of finding the right position for Java Monster. We think that some of our strategy going forward with regard to where we placed the Rehab line, which is really a key line, will perhaps give us some extra weight to put both the Java Monster line and the tea line maybe in the juice, tea, coffee door as opposed to the energy doors, which give us, we hope, increased shelf space. And -- but we know -- we just think that there'd be no -- for it has been a better focus on coffee. It's sort of probably lost a little bit of focus. We've introduced some new SKUs. We changed some flavors. We know we've struggled a little bit with our original one. We just -- we had sort of a -- originally it was named Big Black, and then we changed it to Original. And so it sort of didn't really have a real sexy appeal for our consumer, so we actually reformulated that and relaunched it and sort of replaced it with the Kona Blend. We changed the flavor, and we think we actually made quite a lot of improvement in the flavor for that one. We changed the flavor of our Light product. We also think that has made a big difference. In Vanilla, instead of just being Light, it's Vanilla Light. And we think that's -- and that started to do quite nicely when we look at some of the individual SKUs. So those are 2 of the main things on the flavor in the actual product side. And we've also sort of focused -- we have sort of appointed a separate brand manager, and she's really focused on this product line. This is now her baby. So we think that it's just getting a little more TLC from her, which is, again, motivating the individual, divisional teams and sales guys to obviously look after and not forget about the brand. And everybody gets excited with the main lines and the new launches, and sometimes you get lost in the wash. So we think that's really contributing to the brand, and we'll support her. We think it's a good niche, and we think it'll continue to grow and be a part of our -- the Monster lineup.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Q&A portion of today's conference. I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks.
Rodney C. Sacks: Thanks very much. As you can see from the results of my earlier remarks, we really think that the company is continuing to perform very nicely. The brand is continuing to grow. I mean, we've actually -- for the first time, actually achieved a 30% market share in the convenience channel, which is for Monster as a brand, which is the first time ever, we've got to the 30% level. So we're doing very nicely. Particularly, Great Britain is really doing very, very well in Europe. And so, all in all, we just are -- we're positive about the continued momentum for the brand.  As again, also, as I've indicated, as you must have heard number of times in my remarks, we are very happy with the results for Rehab. We think that's opening a whole new demographic fold and broadening the consumer demographic for Monster, being non-carbonated, being more of a chuggable, sort of drinkable product. And we -- so we're very hopeful for the line extensions, which we believe will bring a whole lot of key consumers into the energy category and continue to broaden our appeal.  So until the, probably the interim update, which we're going to have in mid-December, I'd like to thank you for your support. And we'll fill you in on any further updates at that meeting. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2011 Q2  (2011-08-04 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Rodney Sacks - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Member of Executive Committee and Chairman of Hansen Beverage Company Hilton Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Member of Executive Committee
Analysts: Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Imran Ali - Jefferies & Company, Inc.
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Hansen Natural Corporation Second Quarter 2011 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today, Thursday, August 4, 2011. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO of Hanson Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.
Rodney Sacks: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President is with me today, as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance, and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on management's current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made herein. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2011, and our most recent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, including the sections contained therein entitled, "Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements" for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measures of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated August 4, 2011. A copy of this information is also available on our website at www.hansens.com in the Investor Relations Section. Overall, the company had a good second quarter with record sales up 26.4% and with earnings per share increasing to $0.90 from $0.69 in the same quarter last year. In fact, we are pleased to report another memorable milestone for the company in the second quarter, namely the achievement of the company of gross sales in excess of $0.5 billion in a quarter.  Despite difficult economic environment in our major markets, the United States and Europe, the energy drink category has continued to show growth. This is quite remarkable in the face of general consumer weakness and higher gas prices, which appear to be driving reduced traffic in key retail channels, and speaks to the resilience of the energy drink category.  Not only is the energy drink category continuing to show growth, but sales of Monster Energy continue to show growth in excess of the category. Sales of Peace Tea also showed growth. According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through June 25, 2011, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandises, excluding Wal-Mart, sales in the energy drink category, including Shots, increased 15.8% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 22.3% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 14.6%. Sales of Rockstar increased 20.3%. Sales of 5-Hour increased 33.4%.  Based on Nielsen data in recent months, it appears that the growth rate for 5-Hour is continuing to slow. Sales of Amp decreased 5.3%, sales of NOS increased 10.7% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 14.2%. According to Nielsen reports for the 5 weeks ended June 25, 2011, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel increased by 16% over the comparable 5-week period in 2010. Sales of Monster increased by 21.4% over last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 15.3% over last year.  Rockstar was up 25.7% while 5-Hour was up 29%. Amp was down 4.7%, NOS was up by 10.2% and Full Throttle was down 11.7%. According to Nielsen for the 5 weeks ended June 25, 2011, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars was 29.2% against Red Bull share of 31.7%, and Rockstar's share of 10.3% and 5-Hour share of 11.1%.  According to Nielsen in the 13 weeks ended June 25, 2011, for all outlets combined, sales of energy plus coffee drinks increased 6.7% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 8.6% higher than last year and Starbucks Double Shot Energy was up 15.1%. However, our net sales over Java Monster line to our customers in the second quarter were approximately 11% higher than in the comparable quarter in 2010. Java Monster sales and market share continue to show improvement and Java Monster remains the leading brand in this category. On new non-carbonated Monster Rehab energy drink with electrolytes and additional supplements, which we launch in the first quarter, continues to do well and has already become one of our better-selling items in the convenience and gas channel. We are very pleased with consumer response to this product and we plan to introduce additional products in the Monster Rehab line later this year. We continue to see improvement in Monster's market share and sales numbers in Canada. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ending June 4, 2011, the energy drink category grew 8%. Monster sales increased 41% and its market share increased 5.7 points over the same period last year to 24.7%, while Red Bull sales increased 6% and its market share decreased by 0.7 points to 37.6%.  Rockstar's sales decreased 7% and its market share decreased by 2 points to 12.3%. According to Nielsen, sales in the energy drink category in Mexico grew 9.5% in May 2011 over last year. Sales of Monster Energy in Mexico in May 2011 grew 49% over last year, while sales of Red Bull were 10.7% lower. Monster's market share in Mexico in May 2011 increased by 9.3 points to 35.2% over the same period last year. This excludes Java Monster. Sales continue to progress satisfactorily in United Kingdom and Continental Europe. Net sales in Europe in the second quarter of 2011 in dollars were approximately 102% higher than in the same period last year. Monster continues to gain momentum in Europe. Both cost of goods and selling and general expense and administrative expenses in Europe were lower in the second quarter of 2010, on a per-case basis in local currencies, although higher when converted into U.S. dollars.  While the maturity of the countries in Western Europe are now operating profitably, we still incurred operating losses in the majority of the countries in our newer markets in Central and Eastern Europe in the second quarter, although we believe our brand is becoming more established in those countries. We are pleased to report that we launched Monster Energy in Greece, Cyprus, the Baltic States, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, Ukraine and Portugal during the first half of 2011. We also launched Monster Energy in Colombia, South America in July. We are planning launches in additional countries in Central and Eastern Europe, South America and Asia in the second half of 2011.  As previously reported, both gross and net sales for the comparative first 6-month period of 2010, were negatively impacted by advanced purchases made by customers in the 2009 fourth quarter. Due to our announcement of a new per-case marketing contribution program for Monster Energy distributors, which commenced on January 1, 2010, as well as to avoid potential interruptions in product supply due to our announcement to transition to the SAP enterprise resource planning system in January 2010. If sales attributable to the 2009 fourth quarter volume have been included in the 2010 first quarter, which the company previously estimated at approximately 4% to 6% of 2009 fourth quarter sales, such sales would have moderated the increase in net sales that we achieved in the first 6 months of 2011 from 35.6% to 31.3%. The volume had no effect on the results for the 2011 second quarter that we are now reporting on. During the second quarter of 2011, we continue to add TV advertising to promote our Worx Energy brand, which increased selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales by approximately 1% in the quarter. We continue to see improved response to our Worx Energy brand from consumers and remain confident for the brand.  As previously reported, we had a focus period with Coca-Cola refreshments with Worx Energy and achieved increased distribution levels, and consequently continued our TV advertising. We have created a new TV commercial, which we intend to continue to air, but it's slightly lower levels than in the second quarter of 2011. In addition to advertising during the second quarter, costs incurred by us for sponsorships, samples, premiums and merchandise displays were higher than last year, which contributed to higher selling expenses in the second quarter, as a percentage of net sales as compared to last year. We're continuing to monitor our expenditures in these areas. Our trade development costs and cost of our sampling programs in Europe also contributed to higher selling expenses in the second quarter as a percentage of net sales. As an operating update, gross sales in July 2011 are approximately 15% higher than in July 2010. We caution again that sales in the single month are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of, results for the fourth quarter. For example, many of our promotions this year are set for August and September, whereas many took place over May, June and July last year.  For the first 3 months ended June 30, 2011, sales to retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 4% of gross sales, down from 5% last year. Sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represent a 10% of sales, down from 13% last year. Sales to full-service distributors represented 64% of sales, which is the same as last year. Sales outside the United States increased to 19% from 16% in the same period last year, and other sales were approximately 3% compared with a 2% last year.  Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the second quarter of 2011 exceeded $100 million for the first time, $100 million is the first time, and amounted to $102.6 million compared to $66.6 million in the same quarter last year, increasing 54% over the same period last year.  Included in such sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and then tranship to the military and their customers overseas. Our PC line of ready-to-drink iced teas continues to be well received by consumers, and is gaining traction. Gross sales of Peace Tea were 33% higher in the quarter than in the comparable quarter last year. Gross profit margin achieved in the second quarter was 52.8% this quarter versus 52.9% in the same quarter last year. We continue to believe that cost of goods will remain higher throughout the remainder of 2011 than in 2010, primarily due to increased costs of aluminum cans, PET containers, freight and a number of our ingredients.  As previously indicated, our sugar and apple juice concentrated costs have largely been covered for this year. We do not believe that raw material cost increases at the current levels will have a material negative effect on our margins. Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales in the second quarter were lower than the same period last year. We continue to benefit from efficiencies in this area even though cost of freight and gas have continued to increase.  Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 12.9% in the quarter compared to 10.4% in the same period last year. We are continuing to invest in the Monster Energy brand internationally, including increasing the number of additional trade development sales personnel and sampling stock in Western, Central, and Eastern Europe and Australia, to merchandise and call on small independent stores in many of the countries in which our distribution partners do not offer a full-service, direct-store delivery system. We believe the increased staffing will enable us to reach small independent stores and also increase awareness of our Monster Energy product in international markets through extensive sampling activities. We also believe that these activities will play an important role in the long-term development of the Monster Energy brand and the associated costs are included in selling expenses as opposed to payroll costs. General and administrative costs for the second quarter, as a percentage of net sales decreased to 7.2% from 8.1% in the same period last year. Sucb expenses were reduced by $1.6 million related to a legal settlement and $1 million related to insurance reimbursements.  Although payroll was higher than last year, in part due to the appointment by us of additional sales and marketing staffs, as a percentage of sales, payroll was lower than last year. Operating losses in the second quarter of 2011 in Europe, including the Middle East and Africa, Australia and Brazil combined were higher than in the comparable quarter in 2010, primarily due to substantially increased operating losses incurred by us in the newer launched markets in Central and Eastern Europe. The operating results for Western Europe in the second quarter of 2011 improved over the comparable quarter of 2010. Our effective tax rate for the quarter in June 30, 2011, was 36.5% compared to 42% for the second quarter of 2010 and 39.3% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of a lower effective combined state tax rate, an increase in the tax benefits from the exercise of stock options and the establishment of a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary, established during the second fiscal quarter of 2010. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $418.2 million compared to $354.8 million at December 31, 2010. Short-term investments were $281.2 million compared to $244.6 million at December 31, 2010. Trade accounts receivables net increased to $161.6 million from $101.2 million at December 31, 2010. Days outstanding for receivables were 30.6 days at June 30, 2011, compared to 30 days at June 30, 2010, 27.7 days at December 31, 2010; and 36.3 days at March 31, 2011. Inventories increased to $156.8 million from $153.2 million at December 31, 2010. Average days of inventory was 64.7 days at June 30, 2011, which is lower than the 89.4 days of inventory at December 31, 2010. At June 30, 2011, the company have auction rate securities with a face value of $65 million, was $79.6 million at December 31, 2010, with unamortized cost basis of $55.6 million. During the second quarter, the company exercised its put option to sell $13.6 million of its auction rate securities. Also during the second quarter, the company entered into an agreement as a result of which, the company reclassified $24.5 million of auction rate securities from available for sale to trading, similar to the company's reclassification of $54.2 million of auction rate securities from available for sale to trading in the first quarter of 2010, following an earlier but separate agreement concluded in the quarter. Both of this agreements contain put option rights for applicable auction rate securities, in favor of the company at pre-agreed intervals in the future. For the 3 months ended June 30, 2011, the company had a net expense of approximately $350,000, in respect to the company's auction rate securities and related put options. During the second quarter, we did not repurchase any shares of the company. I would now like to open the floor to questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank: Good numbers, particularly, given the economy. Could you maybe give some context on why you haven't bought back shares, particularly given the size of your cash balance now?
Rodney Sacks: I think that's something that we wouldn't like to comment on. We have the program in place, and we are going -- we'll continue to review that, and we'll continue to review that going forward now. Share price moved up quite high, and we are sort of reviewing our own decisions on what we should do and when we should go into the market and particularly, with the last couple of days, we think that's something we are likely to go into, actively go into the market again shortly.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank: Got it. Would you consider a dividend given where you are now in terms of consistency of earnings?
Rodney Sacks: It's been our practice not to pay dividends. We are looking -- we have considered it. We will be considering it again at a board meeting. But I think that our preferred route at this stage is probably going to be to look at our buyback of shares, but it's something that we will continually keep under review.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank: Okay. Got it. And then looking at your top line, is there -- particularly for international, are you able to break out how much of it came from new markets and rollout some new markets versus like-for-like markets year-over-year?
Rodney Sacks: I think that at this stage, I don't think we'd like to break that out, because even in the results in -- we sort of generally look at sort of -- on our divisional basis but even in some of the divisions, we've got new market. So we haven't done the exercise to break it out. Obviously, what we know is that new markets, particularly Central and Eastern Europe are obviously negative on earnings and cash flow. But those are because that we are going into new markets. So as I indicated earlier, we're happy with our Western European operations now. Sales are still growing very nicely, and that is clearly the majority of our business in Europe. But the other markets are starting to get up to speed, and we just do have any risk then, so we really haven't done that analysis more accurately for the purpose of this discussion, I still want to go into it.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank: Got it. And then just a final question on ad expense. It picked up a bit as a percentage of sales. Obviously, rolling out into a lot of new markets and you had a lot of new products in the quarter. Is this a fair level in terms of the future markets you're rolling out in, and some of the other follow on products you're rolling out with in United States and outside?
Rodney Sacks: Again, United States is more sort of stable, we're sort of more mature in the United States. A lot of these costs are -- come out of the newer markets where you would invest disproportionately as you go into market. You have to prepare with point-of-sale, you have to do all of these things as a percentage, obviously gets thrown up wrong. And because of the fact that we have been entering into a lot of new markets, it is skewed for that reason. We think that we did -- as you are aware, we've really gone into a lot of new markets in Central and Eastern Europe from the middle of last year to the middle of this year. And so we think that there would likely to be a letting up of these costs as we go forward. But again, it all depends in some ways on where we go to in new markets and at what rate. And if we slow the rate of increase in new markets, and I think it will let up, but it's something we owe -- then that's why I mentioned earlier, we are monitoring it because we don't want to obviously, not have the right equipment and assets available to our staff to go into these markets. But at the same time, it does cause us to overspend. Similar things, for example, in sampling, where you go into a new market, you're going to have a whole sampling truck and team, but yet the sales haven't come yet, and you're sort of, sometimes in advance of the sales. So we'll try and obviously, we're trying to manage that carefully but it did go high this quarter, and we're hopeful we'll be able to get it to be reduced. But again, we don't have any sort of definite plans on how to deal with it. And similar, our trade marketing staff going out, we started to go out into Europe with more guys in the field to get to the smaller stores and markets where we believe it's necessary to build our brand. And again, there's also start becoming disproportionate and then they sort of start becoming -- they'll start leveling off. So we were at a sort of the high rate during this period.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Rodney, just first on the category trends and your market share performance. I guess July being up 15% gross sales, do have a U.S. versus international number?
Rodney Sacks: I have but we've not again, broken that up and I wouldn't like to do that at this point.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. And then that just a U.S. market because it looks like the last couple of months, your sales in convenience store channel's been slowing a little bit. So I'm just wondering if there is any indications as to whether some of the recent trends have shown a little bit of a slowness, and whether that's attributable to the macro slowdown. And related to that from a market share perspective, the latest months, it does look like your share gains slowed pretty considerably. So if you can give us perspective on kind of what you're seeing more recently from a category, your brand perspective and your market share perspective?
Rodney Sacks: The category seems to have probably slowed a couple of points from where it was in February, March. Our growth rate was probably pretty similar to what it was in February and March in the convenience category. It did pick a little bit in -- our growth picked up a little bit in April and May. But in our numbers on the Neilsen numbers that we have for the last 4 weeks in convenience, we were up 21.4%. So it is a little lower than we were up in the 2 previous, 4-week periods, but again, higher than what we were up in the previous 4 or 5 periods -- 4, 5 periods before that to the beginning of the year. So we are seeing the trends being very similar and but within a point or 2, a lot of that depends on -- we see, is promotions. As I indicated earlier, we sort of had some promotional cycles, which were I think more skewed to the second quarter or late in the second quarter in July. Last year, this year, some of the promotion will be done with a couple of our bigger customers, are taking place in August, September so it sort of moves it out of the June, July area. So that, I think, also has some effect on the numbers. But there is a slight slowing but we don't -- I think it's not at a point where we believe there's any trend indicative of that. But obviously, the economy itself is also going through a tough time at the moment. So we're seeing 16% increases in the category in the last 5 weeks in convenience. That's pretty exciting.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. And then on Worx, can you quantify how much it added to your second quarter sales, just in terms of any color to what you're seeing in the marketplace now that you've gotten the distribution, and then finally, you talked about the advertising spending behind Worx being about a point addition to your SG&A or selling expenses as a percent of sales. So it sounds like it's going to moderate a little bit. Is there any way to quantify how much going forward?
Rodney Sacks: This sales were -- gross sales, we're basically just under about $4 million in the quarter, which was up quite a bit on the first quarter. But it's not a high number in relation to where we are, but it's starting to become one of the -- obviously, one of the major players in that Shot category, although obviously, very, very far away from the 5-Hour numbers. But it's starting to gain some traction. Where we've got distribution and distribution has improved a little bit, and we are starting to see some bit of sales numbers coming back and repeat purchases. So we're going to continue with supporting the brand. We're going to continue with our TV advertising and change the type of adds to make it a little different. And continue to support it and merchandise it in stores, and we think that we still think that there is -- this brand has an opportunity of being a competitive brand, and being sustainable in that category.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. And what's the ACV right now on that brand?
Rodney Sacks: ACV on that brand? I will give you as we continue to talk, I'll find the numbers. The ACV at the moment for Worx is about 23, I'm showing in convenience and it's much, much less in grocery and drug. So it's very small. So the main positioning we've got is in the convenience channel.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. And then internationally, I mean, you guys done a really great job growing in markets like Canada and Mexico and Europe. I think you said it was up 102%. Are there any markets where you're seeing some weakness. Your total international sales were up 54%. So that implies maybe some of the markets aren't really seeing as strong a growth as Canada, Mexico and Europe. So are there any markets that are seeing some weakness? And if so, why is that happening?
Rodney Sacks: It's not so much markets, it's basically individual countries are up and down. There are odd countries with reasons and often, it's expandable due to the distributor or the partner or some economic conditions in the country itself, or sometimes, the actions of our competitors or sometimes in one case, one country store brand, a very, very powerful store introduced a private label at EUR 0.29. That's through the entire market into a -- out, because that's a 25% of what the cost of the main leading brands, which are Red Bull and ourselves are. So obviously, that's going to have a big effect on the whole of the marketing and the market generally in that -- in that country where it's a big player, and so, you got to deal with this. It takes time to obviously address this and then, things will stabilize and then move back up again. So we are seeing that in different markets. So -- but by and large, the markets are all responding pretty well to the brand. We have some operational issues in some countries, we've addressed them with our own staffing and basically, our partners. We had some issues in Brazil as I think I've alluded to on earlier, the summer production issues, and those are sort of starting to turn around. We're starting to get into it. But the results do follow. And sometimes, there's a lag time. So in some markets, it's taken some time to turn things around. And there are many markets, I mean, we're obviously -- or we sell this throughout the Caribbean, we sell throughout Central America, we sell into a number of other countries in South America. So Australia, so there are many markets. It's a very mixed bag, Julie, I just don't have it analyzed on a -- and I don't think it would be appropriate for me to go into it on a regional basis. They're still too new and still too volatile to really be looking in and taking any trends away from them. I think the main issue is that the brand is generally being relative to each, and pretty much, throughout all the markets as a brand. The take is accepted, the concept is accepted. We're very excited by South America, for example, we start going into places where we've never been. And we are finding guys who are competing in local races and events cause, having get-up their entire cars and Monster-sponsored car, but yet we don't even know who they are. We've never seen them or heard of them. It's a bigger issue for us. But I think what it shows is that there is an awareness for the brand, and an affinity for the brand and the claw. Even in markets we haven't got to yet, where maybe an independent guy may have brought in a container or something. But they're seeing it on the Internet, they're seeing it on our website and on TV, et cetera, and there isn't affinity on the brand as a general rule in all off the markets we're going into. So I think that is the better takeaway as a general rule, rather than looking at specific markets.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Imran Ali.
Imran Ali - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: This is Imran Ali for Jeff Farmer. I think most of my questions were addressed. But I just have a quick follow-ups. Just regarding your International sales, could you remind us what drove the $30 million or roughly $30 million sequential jump in international sales in the second quarter of 2010, and a similar $30 million jump this year?
Rodney Sacks: What you're getting in 2010, what you're getting there is just the -- is a lot of it's seasonal, which is more dramatic in Europe and then also in new markets that we launched going into spring and April because those are the better times to go into those markets. Also, again, you get a market like Canada, which is very cold in winter. So you do get quite a big, what we call, bell curve going into the summer, which is far greater than you would get in the tempered markets in the Western states in the U.S., et cetera.
Imran Ali - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Okay. I got you. And then sort seeing on the international expansion part. I think you mentioned earlier that you're planning on launching in Asia in the second half of this year. And I was just wondering, can you talk a little bit about which countries you're focusing on first as a priority and second to that -- I'm sorry go ahead.
Rodney Sacks: I think that it's probably premature for a number of reasons, including competitive ones for us to get into some of the markets. But we are looking, probably initially a little more in some of the Northern Asian countries. We're really are in pretty advanced negotiations, and with distribution partners in those countries. And it's just premature for me at this stage to actually go to disclose either the identities of the countries or the proposed partners. But hopefully I think that we're hopeful that by the next conference call, by the end of the third quarter, we would have already signed up some of those countries where we're very advanced with them and we'll be ready to launch. We're also in the process of going through the regulatory issues now to have our products approved and passed for sale in those countries. And some within there also takes quite a bit of time. So we're in the throes of all of that at the moment with planning. As I previously indicated, we have appointed a senior person to head up our Asia region, and who's based in Hong Kong. And he's been active full-time in securing these representations and distributors. So we are, we're pretty confident that we will be going ahead in Asia. We will be able to announce it hopefully on the next call.
Operator: And our last question comes from the line of Bill Chappell.
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: You talk a little bit about I think in your remarks that you saw, 5-hour Energy growth slowing, and I just didn't know what we should read into that? Do you see the Shot market kind of plateauing in the U.S. and has that kind of altered your plans for Worx or is it just the comment of -- you think you're gaining some market share and maybe that market share has peaked?
Rodney Sacks: No. I think that by and large -- there maybe many reasons. I think shots were perhaps tried by many of the traditional energy drink, consumers who had energy drinks for many, many years. And probably went to shots for a while, maybe that come back to the energy drinks. I think that -- but there is a slightly, we believe there is a different consumer that is the principal consumer of energy shots, as opposed to energy drinks. But I think there is, again, there is a sort of a limitation on how many people are going to try or be regular energy shot users, and I think there is a more finite universe. I think one of the other things is that as the category grows bigger, as 5-hour grows bigger, they are trading off bigger numbers. So obviously, just from the law of returns, they're going to see the very large increases they were experiencing this time last year, and it's going to reduce substantially, just by virtue of the share numbers. So while the dollars, the percentage increases are dropping off quite substantially, the dollar sales are probably still pretty healthy, and it's showing growth in that category. But I'm just trying to put it in perspective, because we're obviously putting it together. The category, we're looking at the percentage numbers, and I thought that it was appropriate to -- in looking at their number versus the more mature and established energy drink numbers to try and put it in perspective. Because their sales increases going from the end of last year, beginning of the year, were in the 70s and 60%. And what we've seen is a gradual drop off into the 50s, the 40s, the 30s and the last 5-week period, touched 29. But the market is a large-sized market. There is room for a good competitor, there is room at a size for a good competitor that would be, which we believe would be important to us, and would be contribute to healthy volume and sales and bottom line to us if we could establish ourselves as a credible competitor. And we believe there is a good opportunity to do so. There are -- the margins are good, and so we believe there is still good and valid reasons for us to persist in trying to find the formula that will work to be a credible competitor in that category, as we say, which is I think, is slightly different consumer to the mainstream energy consumer, and we believe that we'll obviously then, be accretive to us in the long-term. So we are going to persist with our brand in that category.
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And just switching gears. I think last quarter, and I forgot the exact number you gave but I mean, initial sales in the month of April were a little bit lower than what you ended up reporting for the full quarter. I can't remember if that was timing of promotions or just timing of shipments. And were your promotions more weighted towards June or May? I'm just trying to put that in perspective.
Rodney Sacks: As we've indicated, we're giving you the raw numbers as they come out. We always, and we always say this, you guys have got to understand that, that becomes, because people all ask for that update, but it's a 1-month number. That number is affected by the number of days you happen to be shipping and delivering that month. It's affected by public holidays in the dates on which they fall. Now with the Fourth of July, on what day. Where do you get the Memorial Day. Where did that fall? Those are where the people order for that. Those are important factors. Where you do promotions. If you're doing a promotion in May instead of April, April and May and as we said now July or August, those have quite a big impact when you do promotions with big customers. We have some very big convenience chains. We do promotions with you, we've got 7-Eleven, Gustav [ph] which is Circle K. They're all extensive chains, there's Wal-Mart, the club stores. And depending on your promotional calendar, these things do get swayed. So we always caution and we continue and I did say in this call to caution that the one month numbers are really very, very difficult to get a read on it and you should not read into that, into a one month. In the quarter, you're going to find very substantial jumps from month-to-month in where we come out at the end of the quarter, and there's no trend that one month is higher or lower, that's the second month in the quarter can be low, and then the third month higher or vice versa. There's just no pattern to it.
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then just final question on cost, I assume where you'd be running through your hedges on both apple juice and sugar as we near in -- gets close to year end. I mean kind of update on what you're looking at in 2012 in terms of are you starting to hedge or lacking cost there? Or do we need price increases to kind of offset that as we move into next year?
Hilton Schlosberg: We pull[ph] those results, and we are looking at our costs for 2012 as we would in the ordinary of course. It's quite interesting that apple contract prices seem to be coming off somewhat, but we still have significant inventories in our facilities. And the sugar, we are actually -- have already taken the position on sugar for the early part of 2012. Aluminum, we're watching and you've probably seen what's happened with aluminum, and will probably come off even more in the days and weeks ahead, and we'll evaluate what we should be doing with aluminum. But as we've always said on our calls, the extent of increases that we've seen, and some of the increases resulted in aluminum have been substantial in dollars per pound terms. But in our business, because of the high margins that we have on our energy products, the impact is not that significant, as it would be in an ordinary beverage company.
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: So just to clarify, I mean is there a chance going 2012 that your input cost could be flat to actually down year-over-year?
Rodney Sacks: I'm not prepared to speculate on that now. It's just too early even to comment, and we don't give guidance.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Sacks for any closing remarks. Please continue, sir.
Rodney Sacks: Thanks. In closing, I would just like to reiterate the fact that -- and point to the fact that the actual growth in the energy category in -- particularly in the convenience category, is still in the mid-to upper teens. So it still is very, very encouraging. Particularly, in the uncertain times where we're facing at the moment in the last few weeks as we've all -- have seen and become aware of. So we are fortunate to be in an industry that is continuing to grow, and we are even more fortunate in that we believe we're continuing to grow ahead of that industry. So the same applies in Europe. We are continuing to grow, and we are continuing to establish a strong beachhead for our brand in Europe. It's starting to gain traction and establish itself, and so we are very positive for the rest of the year, for the company and for the category. And thank you for your support. We have to see what happens. We had a very rocky day today on the stock market, everybody, so we'll have to see what -- and we all go forward as the economy and the world economies actually do. I mean we're in very uncharted waters now, but we are positive that we're in a good position financially from a cash flow point of view and we're strong. So obviously, we're going to manage ourselves through this. Thank you very much for your support and we'll report back to you at the end of the next quarter. Thanks very much.

Positive news is that the growth in the energy drink category inclusive of energy shots that we saw in the 2010, fourth quarter has continued through the first quarter of 2011 and appears to have a solid base. According to Nielsen, for the 13 weeks through April 23, 2011, all outlets combined in the convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, excluding Wal-Mart, sales in the energy drink category, including shots, increased 16.4% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 21.7% in the 13-week period concerned while sales of Red Bull increased by 16.2%. Sales of Rockstar increased 10.9%, 5-Hour sales increased 46.4%, sales of Amp decreased 1.1%. Sales of NOS increased 12.1% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 19.5%.  According to the Nielsen reports, for the 4 weeks ended April 23, 2011, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel increased by 15.9% over the comparable four-week period in 2010. Sales of Monster increased by 23.3% over last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 15.6% over last year. Rockstar was up 8% while 5-Hour was up 38.4%. Amp was down 3.5%, Full Throttle was down 14.3% and NOS was up by 13.6%.  According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April 23, 2011, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars was 29.3% against Red Bull share of 31.7% and Rockstar share of 9%. According to Nielsen, in the 13 weeks ended April 23, 2011, for all outlets combined, sales of energy plus coffee drinks increased 6% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 1.1% higher than last year and Starbucks Double Shot Energy was up 20%.  However, our net sales to our customers on the Java Monster line in the first quarter were approximately 15.6% higher than in the comparable quarter of 2010. Java Monster sales and market share remain the leader in this category. Sales of Monster Rehab, our new non-carbonated rehydration energy drink that we introduced during the first quarter, appeared to be progressing well. We are continuing to see improvement in Monster's market share and sales numbers in Canada.  According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended March 12, 2011, the energy drink category grew 12%. Monster sales increased 39% and its market share increased 4.9 points over the same period last year to 24.4%, while Red Bull sales increased 9% and its market share decreased 1.1 points to 37.1%. Rockstar sales increased 17% and its market share increased by 0.6 of a point to 12.9%.  According to Nielsen, sales in the energy drink category in Mexico grew 12.7% in March 2011 over last year. Sales of Monster Energy in Mexico in March 2011 grew 37.9% over last year while sales of Red Bull were 1.2% lower. Monster's market share in Mexico in March 2011 increased by 5.8 points to 31.5% over the same period last year, and these figures exclude a little business in Java Monster that we do in Mexico.  Sales continue to progress satisfactorily in the United Kingdom and continental Europe. Net sales in Europe in the first quarter of 2011 in dollars were approximately 157% higher than in the same period last year. We believe that Monster is, overall, continuing to gain momentum in Europe. Both cost of goods and selling expenses in Europe were lower than in the first quarter of 2010 on a per case basis. We are launching Monster Energy in Portugal, Greece, Cyprus and the Baltic states, that's Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, during the first half of 2011 and are planning launches in additional countries in Central and Eastern Europe, South America and Asia in the second half of 2011.  And as previously reported, both gross and net sales comparative first quarter of 2010 were negatively impacted by bulk [ph] purchases made by customers in the 2009 fourth quarter due to our announcement of a new per case marketing contribution program for Monster Energy distributors, which commenced on January 1, 2010, as well as to avoid potential interruptions in product supply due to our announcement to transition the SAP enterprise resource training system in January 2010.  Its sales attributable to the 2009 fourth quarter buy-in had been included in the 2010 first quarter which the company has previously estimated at approximately 4% to 6% of 2009 fourth quarter sales. Such sales would've moderated the increase in net sales that we achieved in the current quarter of 49.7%.  During the quarter, we commenced TV advertising to promote our Worx Energy brand. Initial consumer response appears to be positive. However, as distribution levels achieved for Worx were lower than expected, we reduced our plan to spend on TV advertising during the quarter. We are in a focus period with Coca-Cola refreshments for Worx Energy and depending on distribution levels achieved, we intend to increase the level of our TV advertising spend.  As a trading update, gross sales in April 2011 are approximately 15% higher than in April 2010. The lower percentage increase in sales in April 2011 over April last year is partly due to the relatively higher level of sales that was achieved by us in April 2010. We caution again that sales in a single month are often disproportionately impacted by various factors and should not necessarily be imputed to the fourth quarter.  For the 3 months ended March 31, 2011, sales to retail groceries, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 5% of gross sales, down from 7% last year. Sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 10% of sales, down from 12% last year. Sales to full-service distributors represented 65% of sales, up from 64% in the same period last year. Sales outside of the United States increased to 18% from 14% in the same period last year. Other sales were 2% down from 3% last year.  Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the first quarter of 2011 amounted to $72.8 million compared to $37.8 million in the same quarter last year, increasing 93% over the same period last year. Included in such sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and then transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. Gross profit margin achieved in the first quarter was 52.1% this quarter versus 52.3% in the same quarter last year.  At this time, we anticipate that cost of goods will be higher throughout the remainder of 2011 primarily due to increased costs of aluminum, cans, PET containers, freights and a number of other ingredients. You'll recall that sugar and apple juice costs have been largely covered by us at anticipated levels. But if sales continue to be higher, we will have to buy in the open market, although we do not anticipate that such increase will have a material effect on our margins.  Distribution expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were lower than in the same period last year. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 13.7% in the quarter compared to 13% in the same period last year. Sponsorship and endorsement costs incurred by us in the first quarter were approximately $3.2 million higher than in the comparable quarter last year but were lower as a percentage of net sales.  Advertising, commissions and cost of merchandise displays, samples and premiums were also higher in the quarter than in the comparable quarter last year. Increased cost of our sampling teams, as well as our trade development sales personnel, particularly in Europe, also contributed to the increase in such costs. We believe we have a unique opportunity to establish and develop the Monster Energy brand internationally and that it is necessary for us to continue to invest in the brand internationally.  In the United Kingdom and certain overseas countries, our distribution partners do not operate a full-service direct store delivery system to stores in all channels, particularly small independent stores like our full-service distribution partners due in the United States. Consequently, to maximize the opportunity in the independent channel, we need to supplement our distribution partners' sales forces with our own TV and sales personnel to call on service and merchandise more independent stores, even though this results in increased cost to us.  In fact, we are extending the program in the United Kingdom as well as to select countries in Europe and elsewhere. Additionally, to increase awareness of our Monster products in new international markets, we're undertaking extensive sampling activities. We believe that these activities will play an important role in the development and establishment of our Monster brand in those countries. Such costs are included in selling expenses but do not for part on our payroll cost. General and administrative costs, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 9.4% from 13.1% in the same period last year as federal costs were only marginally higher than last year, partly due to the benefit of lower stock-based compensation expense, which was approximately $3.8 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared to $5 million in the same quarter last year.  Operating losses in the first quarter in Europe, including the Middle East and Africa, Australia and Brazil combined, were lower than in the comparable quarter in 2010. Our effective tax rate for the quarter ended March 31, 2011, was 38% compared to 37.1% for the first quarter of 2010 and 39.3% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of the continuation of a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary established during the second fiscal quarter of 2010. The increase in tax rates was partially offset by lower effective state tax rates for the 3 months ended March 31, 2011.  Our Peace Tea line, our ready-to-drink iced teas has been well-received by consumers and it's continuing to gain traction.  Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amount to $295.5 million compared to $354.8 million at December 31, 2010. Short-term investments were $299 million compared to $244.6 million at December 31, 2010. Long-term investments consisting of auction rate securities decreased from $44.2 million to $30.5 million. Trade accounts receivables net increased to $149 million from $101.2 million at December 31, 2010.  Days outstanding for receivables were 36.3 days at March 31, 2011, compared to 27.7 days at December 31, 2010. Inventories increased to $173.7 million from $153.2 million at December 31, 2010. And the average days of inventory was 91.5 days at March 31, 2011, which is higher than the 89.4 days of inventory at December 31, 2010. At March 31, 2011, the company held auction rate securities with a face value of $78.6 million, $79.6 million at December 31, 2010. The company determined that an impairment of $7.2 million existed in March 31, 2011, of which $2.2 million was deemed temporary and $5 million was deemed other than temporary. As a result, included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss is $1.4 million net of taxes as of March 31, 2011. The auction rate securities will continue to accrue interest at the contractual rates until their respectable auctions succeed or they are redeemed. After the quarter, the company exercised its put option to sell 13.6 million of its auction rate securities. During the quarter, we repurchased 708,140 shares in the company at an average price of $54.88 per share. I would like to open the floor to questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with UBS.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank: I guess, the first question, looks like your net selling price increased by about 4.5%. Can you give us more color on that? And particularly if it's front-line pricing or maybe it's a reduction in promo or mix or something?
Rodney Sacks: Sorry, I didn't hear you clearly. You talk about selling? Sorry, you just weren't clear, Kaumil, on the call.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank: I was trying to get a read on selling price. It looked like it was up about 4.5%.
Rodney Sacks: I think it is really just a factor of mix of products during the quarter. I don't think there's anything else to it.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank: So there were no price increases though on there?
Rodney Sacks: There weren't on the Monster side. There were some small increases in the [indiscernible], but I don't think that had any real impact on it. We think it really is attributable to a mix of products.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank: Okay, got it. And then the other thing, looks like margins were fairly strong. Is that operating leverage where the cost coming in maybe a little bit lower than you had expected? Could you give us a little more on leverage or on your margins?
Rodney Sacks: As indicated, the selling expenses were still marginally higher because of the -- we're still investing in the brand, but when you go down to savings, we're at the bottom line in the G&A and payroll, and that should really help the percentages. But otherwise, they were pretty much in line with last year on a comparable basis.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank: Okay, got it.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Rodney, just your April sales trend, you said 15%. That's including international, so U.S. plus international?
Rodney Sacks: That's an estimate for, yes, all of them. Correct.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And is U.S. then lower than 15% if you think about just the international growth that historically has been outperforming the U.S. number pretty meaningfully?
Rodney Sacks: Probably there is a lower rate in the U.S., yes. I don't know the exact percentage, but there is a lower rate in the U.S.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And to your point, I mean, I know the monthly sales trends could be pretty noisy but just any color as to why April did slow down pretty meaningfully in the U.S.? I know some of the beer companies called out weather issues. There was also higher gas prices. So anything you can maybe extrapolate as to why...
Rodney Sacks: Some of the beverage companies we're talking about their sales, but they were talking about sales at Easter falling into different periods. We really don't have any color on that. For us, we look at the Nielsen trends that sort of are ahead of ourselves, look at the type bought from retail. And as I've indicated, the numbers, they're all strong. Maybe the convenience channels may be off a point or so on the last 4-week numbers. And there's no other reason. Again, it's just monthly. It's a very short period. It's ordering, it's when they order. I mean, a lot of orders, a lot of our purchases are through CCR now, depending on when they order at beginning of the month. And these have quite a big impact on the numbers. And we also have a very high comp. It just happened to be that last year in March was a strong March. And so you're trading off a very high comp as well. And that obviously affects it. But if you look at the -- just looking at the convenience in 4 weeks, the convenience was trending at basically 16.9%, 17.3%, 17.5% and then 15.9% for the last 4-week period. So we think it's a solid base but there is clearly a little bit of softness in that gauge. Even in the actual convenience numbers for energy and as I said, I think you're correct, we've seen that in some of the other announcements and discussions that have taken place in the industry. But again, I make the point, I want to make it clear that those are the numbers, but there's a long quarter still to go before we end the quarter and they shouldn't be taken as indicative of where we're likely to end up at the end of the quarter.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And then your comment about costs going up, I mean, clearly I think some of the input costs, obviously, have become more challenging. Any way you can tell us how much your cost will be up? And then you also said your margins won't be meaningfully impacted. So I just wanted to get color on what gives you confidence that your margins will hold up even with comp going up.
Rodney Sacks: Well, as we indicated, part of the input costs, which are basically the apple juice and aluminum -- no, no, no, which one we fixed? Sugar and aluminum are fixed. If you then take the remaining costs into account, a large component is our actual ingredients and supplements and they are reasonably stable. They've been subject to small increases as well as particular items have been subject to some increases, some ingredients. But generally, more, more stable than the raw material commodity prices. And then you look at the cost more likely to be impacted, which is aluminum cans, PET containers. And if you take that as a percentage of our total cost of goods, it is very, very much less impacted then, for example, the traditional beverage companies are. And so if you take all of those factors, we believe that, yes, we will see an impact but we don't believe it will ultimately be material. But there will be some impact but not material. We just don't want to quantify more because we ourselves are not exactly certain of where we are and the commodities are very fluid and we're buying on the spot markets. And so we don't know where they'll end up the year.
Hilton Schlosberg: Actually, shake-up today as you noted, Judy.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Are these aluminum, PET, are these about roughly a quarter of your cost?
Hilton Schlosberg: We don't disclose that information.
Rodney Sacks: Yes, we've not sort of gone there. Just we purchase those.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. And then just in terms of the Worx, you talked about distribution off to a slower start. What do you think happened there? And then, how do we think about Worx just as from a consumer proposition perspective? What are you seeing in your interaction with your customers or just any read on the consumer pool of that product?
Rodney Sacks: We think it's too early to tell, more definitive than we have indicated. Our best sort of read was that we sort of -- that the product got out but people we sort of were anticipating waiting, and then some of these other companies were launching it and they were waiting for the TV, and we were waiting for them to get distribution up to a point that made TV sensible. You don't want to advertise to empty shelves. But what has happened in the end is that the distribution levels, as far as we've been able to entertain, sort of we're at the low 20 levels and we sort of then started to review spending a lot of money against distribution at that level. So we reduced some of the TV spend after we had started and pulled back and then had a number of, obviously, discussions with CCR and they'd put a focus of the brand and the distribution levels are moving up. The latest, I heard yesterday, it would seem to be we're moving up into the 30s levels, and it is moving up. And so as we see distribution being secured and availability, the product being available, we will -- the intention is to increase the TV spend to support the brand again. But it's really too premature at this point. I think by the next quarter, we'll be in a far better position to have a better read on Worx and how it's faring.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Just wanted to follow-up on the commodities side, it sounds like you're still not hedged or there are no near-term plans to hedge aluminum. Do you see any changes to the hedging strategy as you move through the year? And I guess you would be benefit if these prices start to drop? And then also, any change on pricing? I mean, I know that you had said the price per case for the quarter wasn't because of a price increase. But do you or the industry needed to take some pricing before the year's out?
Rodney Sacks: Bill, let me, if I may, just talk about the hedging of aluminum. Obviously, we watch our commodities on a very frequent basis. In fact, daily with regard to aluminum. And we are reviewing the cost of commodities and we'll make a determination as we move forward what our strategy should be. Right now, we had covered a small portion of our aluminum in the first quarter but we are evaluating the strategy, and you know what happened today. As I said on my response to Judy, commodities came up significantly today and we are reviewing it on a very regular basis.
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay, and then on the Worx spend, just trying to quantify or get some more color on how much of the spend was postponed. Is it something that's postponed throughout the year or just kind of from first quarter to second quarter in terms of the launch?
Rodney Sacks: I don't have the figures available. We just basically reduced our weekly spend that had been planned on a campaign. We had some, what I call, black periods in the white periods, whatever, that we would go on air and off air. So we just reduced the spend basically. It's easier for me to give you an idea of the spend, but not on what our plan was going to be. I don't have the number and I think it's not appropriate to go into what we are going to spend and how we're going to spend it. And then some of that is up in the air. A lot of that will depend on how quickly distribution levels are increased and how we haven't taken a decision on what to actually invest back in the spend at this point in time.
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: But it doesn't sound like it was a massive shift. It was just some timing issues for certain areas.
Rodney Sacks: Yes, but we did reduce the actual weekly spend quite a bit. Particularly, I think it was in March, we pulled back quite a bit. So we started off a little higher, then we pulled it back until we see where we are and then we'll invest again.
William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And then just one last question, just for housekeeping. Is Worx included in the price per case number or not? If so, would it eventually bring the price per case number down?
Rodney Sacks: No, it would bring the price per case number up, but it really doesn't have a material effect on us in the quarter. It had an effect but not a material effect.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA.
Caroline Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.: Just want to understand, it sounds like you're continuing to expand your international footprint, and would you expect to be able to shrink your losses on international as you do that just because some of the older markets are becoming profitable or losing less?
Rodney Sacks: The answer is yes and no. We are becoming more profitable in many of the countries where we've been established for a long period of time, but there are exceptions to that rule. There are some countries that our stores, we're still incurring cost. But we see the ultimate benefit coming down the line. But the going forward, it's very difficult, Caroline, to give you an answer because we think that there is a good chance of us being able to reduce the losses. Certainly on a per-case basis we have. But we are continuing to expand and the actual expansion is very fluid. The way we are expanding is we're looking for the right partner in the right country, and that is a big factor in determining where do we go first. We have a wish list of countries and we have a list of which countries which we think our pricing is better and we'd like to go to. In a perfect world, we'd go, in an orderly fashion, 1 through 20. But it isn't an orderly world and we look at opportunities when they arise and that will change, there are a number of factors that change or literally are very fluid. Literally, until about 3 months before a launch, we'll secure a distributor of our launch. Things are changing. So even our plans within Eastern Europe are going to change in which country we launch it in the second half. I now am pretty well-aware of that, that we're going to change the countries we are planning to launch. The rich countries, to one extent, how much resources we put behind different launches in different countries. It varies. And things like that will change. Some of these things are also dependent on the economies of the countries and our distribution partners, particularly in Eastern Europe. So it's really very hard for us to give you any further color on that.
Caroline Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.: That's helpful, though. I also want to ask about the enormous revenue growth you had this quarter. Was any of it a pull-forward, do you think? Because even on a two-year basis, it would imply a run rate of about 25% average growth, which is still very, very high.
Rodney Sacks: No, absolutely not. Those are the sales that we were able to achieve.
Hilton Schlosberg: Caroline, you must also temper the increase with what happened with that buy-in in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Caroline Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.: No, I understand. But even so, 50% growth was astounding.
Rodney Sacks: Yes, but can I add a big contribution, as I gave you the numbers from Europe, which was very healthy. And then one of our new products that we launched late last year, Absolutely Zero, is doing very nicely. That's really performed very nicely and, as I said, we've got Rehab, which is also, we think, is doing nicely for us.
Caroline Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.: And did your core brand grow as well? Just the base margin...
Rodney Sacks: Generally, our green core brand is growing, correct. It is doing nicely and is continuing to grow. For example, in the latest convenience number, the 13 weeks, our core 16-ounce Green Monster is up 19% against the category growth of convenience of 16.9 for the 13-week period. And that is, we think, is very encouraging because that is the workhorse of the brand and that is what the brand's about. And we think that, that shows well for the brand.
Caroline Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.: And can you just give any more color -- I know you need to add sales. You mentioned maybe the U.K. where CC, for example, doesn't have direct store delivery. But is that incremental spending versus what you originally anticipated or something you've factored in over time?
Rodney Sacks: I think it's probably more of a -- as we're continuing to go international, we are continuing to incur costs. And what I really wanted to give everyone a color of -- one of the reasons why we are incurring costs, as we've always indicated, the margins that we anticipate from overseas are lower than the margins, generally, we'd been incurring -- be able to achieve in the U.S. And one of the factors is, in those margins, there's higher cost of goods, slightly lower selling prices relatively speaking in certain countries. But also, the cost of investing and establishing our brand in markets that are already well-established and there are a lot of competitors, not only Red Bull, but other local brands and private label. And so we are investing in this area. We believe there is a -- it is the right way to invest, the right way to get consumers to taste your product and sampling. To get -- as I said, it depends on the country. Some countries, our distribution partners have very, very strong distribution systems and are calling on every little store. In others, they just don't get down to them. In many places, you've got to go through a wholesaler, which means that you've got to create the demand for the brand from the individual store owners to pull the brand when they go buy their weekly stuff from the wholesalers. Countries like that particularly come to mind are Great Britain, where the very, very small independent stores, the go-to bookers and demand. There's a whole host of wholesalers that they go to. And in France, they go to Metro [ph]. So in order to get the demand created, you've got to do a lot of the heavy lifting ourselves. And then we are putting TV and sales personnel into the field to open up the accounts and get the store owners to become familiar with the brand when they see that it gets sold and it goes through. When they go back to the wholesaler the next week, they're able to -- hopefully we're selling these by the second or third time we've called on them, they now know the brand, they see it moving through their store and now it will be part of their regular weekly orders. And that's really the strategy we're having to follow in many of the countries where -- for a lot of full cost of transport and then congestion, the distributors just don't go to the small accounts.
Hilton Schlosberg: And just for the record, we include those costs, those TDM costs in selling expenses.
Caroline Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.: I have one last thing. Some people have worried higher gas prices would cut off demand, really impact demand. You're not seeing it on energy, and I think even Coke and Pepsi have said not so much yet. Do you have any explanation for that?
Rodney Sacks: We really don't. All I could say is that we saw that very, very small drop-off in the growth rate in the convenience channel that I referred to earlier that I gave you the figures earlier. And so while it's still in the mid-teens and it's really healthy, it is a slight -- there had been a slight ameliorating of the growth. And we think that might be due to gas prices. But something again, I just don't think we have a better color on it. The world of Pepsi, as you have, the economist on this top, probably they can give you more color than we can.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I guess, just starting with selling expenses. It seems to be mirroring sales growth at least sort of the last year or 2. Curious if you think that, that sort of trend should continue in terms of absolute numbers or at least just give a little bit of a direction on kind of you're thinking about it. You've talked a little bit about international. But even in the U.S. in terms of the core spend levels.
Rodney Sacks: I think that in the U.S., we have been achieving some savings on a percentage basis, but that's being basically offset somewhat by the spend internationally, which has been higher as we are launching in small markets where you don't have the volume to set and to offset it against. And so eventually, as part of a long-term plan, we believe we will start getting, being able to achieve benefits. But in the shorter term, we sort of looking to try and really match our growth and keep going in that area. But obviously, we're trying to manage that and hopefully, as we go through the rest of the year, we might be able to achieve, have some sort of savings in that area. But it really is, again, it's something that I'm not really in a position to give you direction on.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And then on the G&A side, that was up a little bit sequentially year-on-year but options were down. Was it legal expenses again? Was that the big contributing factor here? If so, should that moderate?
Rodney Sacks: Legal expenses, yes, were pretty similar. We believe that we have resolved a couple of reasonably large litigations in the last few months and we think there might be some saving there going forward, but we still do have some important litigation relating to IP and the securities litigation, which is costly. So we can't tell which way we'll go on that. But we hopefully will be able to try to take that down a little bit.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. And then just finally, in terms of gross margins, so not to keep beating on this, but you said you're not anticipating any material impact on margins. What does material mean to you, Rodney?
Rodney Sacks: I don't think that's something I want to quantify. Everybody will, I think, have their own view of materiality. I just don't think -- I mean, I just want to be material. It's something I just won't, don't feel comfortable getting into.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Well, I guess maybe putting it differently, so if you can go back to 2005, your gross margins have been within a band of, call it, high-51s to low, mid-53s? I mean, does that seem like somewhere that we should be looking at going forward?
Rodney Sacks: You've indicated the band. I think that's reasonable. But you've got to really come to your own conclusion on the band. We really aren't in a position to give guidance on that.
Operator: And I show no further questions at this time. Please continue.
Rodney Sacks: All right, thanks very much, guys. Obviously, we're also all pleased with the results that we were able to achieve in the first quarter. We are obviously, working hard to continue to use new products. And in the second quarter, we'll see how we go. We are -- I want to point out that we do have a stockholders' meeting in 2 weeks' time. Being 2 weeks away, expect us at least to talk about 10 days, 9 days or something. I don't know. Anyway, it's pretty soon. It won't be much of an update, I think, that we'll be able to really give at that time. We obviously, will -- we'll deal with everything, but I think that I just really want to give the investors and analysts a heads-up that there really doesn't seem to be much more that we're going to be able to give color on between now and the stockholder meeting. But we will be there, and thank you very much for your attendance and we will report again at the end of the next quarter. Thanks very much. Goodbye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Hansen Natural Corporation Fourth Quarter and Year End 2010 Financial Results Conference call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead, sir.
Rodney Sacks: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today, as is Tom Kelly, our Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends.  Management cautions that these statements are based on management's current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made herein. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2010, and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.  An explanation of the non-GAAP measures of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated February 24, 2011. A copy of this information is also available on our website at www.hansens.com in the Investor Relations section.  The improved trend in the beverage market in general in North America and certain countries internationally to which I referred in our recent communications to stockholders, although choppy, appears to be continuing. In particular, the energy category appears to be continuing to gain momentum with increased growth principally in the important convenience and gas store channel and to a lesser degree, in the grocery and growth channels.  The macro environment continues to be challenging as we continue to face economic uncertainty and high unemployment levels in the United States and many of the other countries in which we are selling our product. A consumer-led recovery continues to be kept at bay in many regions, particularly in developed markets such as United States and Europe including United Kingdom. Despite these conditions, we were able to continue to grow the Monster brand during the fourth quarter.  During the third quarter of last year, we launched Monster Absolutely Zero to address increasing consumer demand for low- or 0-calorie beverage products. Early indications are that Absolute Zero has been well received by distributors, retail customers and consumers and has resulted in limited cannibalization of Monster lo-carb. The other new product launched by us during the third quarter of last year continued to be well received. Worx Energy shots packed in 2-oz PET plastic bottles have achieved reasonable distribution through CCR. We intend to support the launch of Worx Energy through traditional television advertising, which commenced a few days ago.  The repositioning of our Java Monster line and the introduction of the new X-Presso Monster SKUs is progressing, although it is still too early to evaluate the success of such repositioning. The rollout of our super concentrated energy drink, Monster M3, which is packed in 5-oz glass bottles has been slow, but we are taking steps to secure increased distribution of M3. Trends are proceeding well for the launch of our new non-carbonated Monster Rehab energy drink, with electrolytes and additional supplements in March 2011. Sales of Peace Tea continue to meet our expectations, and we are about to launch a line extension named Peace Tea Caddyshack, which is a combination of tea and lemonade.  Turning to some reported sales numbers. According to Nielsen, for the 13 weeks ended January 22, 2011, all outlets combined, namely, convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers excluding Wal-Mart, sales in the energy drink category including shots increased 14.8% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 18.3% in the 13-week period concerned, while sales of Red Bull increased by 12.1%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 15.2%. Sales of 5-Hour Energy increased 63.7%, while sales of Amp dropped 1%. Sales of NOS increased 11.2%. Sales of Full Throttle dropped 21.9%, and No Fear was down 46%.  According to the Nielsen report for the four weeks ended January 22, 2011, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel, as defined by us, increased 16.9% over the comparable four-week period in 2010. Over this four-week period, sales of Monster increased by 19.6% over last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 15.9% and Rockstar was up 19.4%. Amp was up 3.5%, while NOS was up 12.9% and Full Throttle was down 24.8%. 5-Hour Energy increased 56.7%.  According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended January 22, 2011, Monster's market share of the convenience and gas channel of the energy drink category, including energy shots, was 27.9% against Red Bull's share of 32%, 5-Hour Energy's share of 11.3%, and Rockstar's share of 9.6%.  According to Nielsen in the 13-week period ended January 22, Monster continued to make good progress in the grocery channel, in which sales of energy drinks increased by 13.4% over the same period last year. Sales of Red Bull increased by 11.7% while sales of Monster increased by 18.6%. In the same period, sales of Rockstar increased by 8.8%.  According to Nielsen, sales of Java Monster represented approximately 10.5% of the sales of the Monster brand for the 13 weeks to January 22, 2011, which is a decrease of 2.3 percentage points from 12.8% in the same period last year. In the 13 weeks ended January 22, 2011, for all outlets combined, sales of ready-to-drink energy plus coffee drinks increased by 1.7% over the same period last year. Sales of Starbucks Double Shot energy increased 21.4% in the current period, while sales of Monster were at similar levels to last year. Sales of Rockstar Roasted were 26.5% lower than last year, and sales of Full Throttle Coffee were 53.2% lower than last year.  In Canada, we are continuing to see improvements in both sales and market share for Monster. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended December 18, 2010, the energy drink category grew 19%, while sales of Monster grew 35% over last year. Monster's market share increased 2.5 points over the same period last year to 21.7%, while Red Bull share increased one point to 35.8%. Rockstar's market share decreased by 1.3 points to 16.2%.  According to Nielsen, sales of Monster Energy in Mexico in December 2010 grew 35.1% over last year, while sales of Red Bull declined 8.6%. Sales of Monster's nearest other competitor, the lower-priced Gladiator energy drink, was 16.9% lower than last year. Monster's market share in Mexico in December 2010 increased by seven points to 31.1%, which excludes Java Monster.  In the 12 months ended December 31, 2010, our sales of Monster Energy products to Mexico were lower than in the same period of 2009, primarily due to our having experienced a disruption in Mexico during the year following the termination of our distributor in Baja and Sonora. I previously mentioned the proposed introduction of a 25% tax on energy drinks in Mexico, which was in fact implemented from January 1. In December 2010, our distributor in Mexico increased its purchases of Monster Energy drinks in anticipation of the introduction of such tax. We have adjusted the caffeine levels in Monster Energy drinks sold to Mexico in an effort to address such legislation.  Sales of Monster Energy drink in United Kingdom and Europe continue to make good progress. Sales in Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia continue to perform satisfactorily. And in the fourth quarter of 2010, we launched Monster in three additional countries in Europe, namely, Austria, Switzerland and Bulgaria. As an update, I confirm that during the first quarter of 2011, CCE commenced the distribution of our Monster Energy drinks in Sweden in place of our previous distributor.  In the fourth quarter of 2010, net sales in Europe in U.S. dollars were 142% higher than the comparable quarter in 2009. In 2010, we continue to leverage the increase in sales in Europe to reduce our operating expenses, sponsorship expenses, sampling and point-of-sale costs, as well as our payroll cost in Europe on a per case basis. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we achieved a breakeven position in Europe on a currency-neutral basis. Sales of Monster are continuing to make progress in Central America, Caribbean, Brazil, Australia and New Zealand, Tahiti and South Africa. We believe that we have overcome the majority of the importation and production issues that we faced in Brazil last year and look forward to further establishing the Monster Energy brand in Brazil in 2011.  We are continuing to work with our distribution partner in Australia to improve Monster's market share in that country. We plan to pursue our strategy to introduce Monster Energy into new markets in Asia, South America, the Middle East and Africa in 2011, in addition to Central and Eastern Europe.  Monster Energy drinks continue to achieve record sales during the fourth quarter. We are pleased to report that the steps we've taken to reverse the lower sales trend that we saw in Java Monster in the first nine months of 2010 appears to be working as the net sales volumes of the Java Monster product line in the fourth quarter were comparable to the fourth quarter of last year.  Net sales of our new Peace Tea brand continue to gain strength. The increase in sales of Monster Energy drinks was partially offset by decreased sales of Nitrous Monster in the quarter, which has since been repositioned as Monster Energy Extra Strength with nitrous technology and Monster Hitman energy shots, which are all being discontinued.  As previously advised, advanced purchases were made by our customers in the fourth quarter of 2009 due to our announcement of the new per case marketing contribution program for Monster Energy distributors commencing January 1, 2010, as well as to avoid potential interruptions in product supply due to our announcement to transition our North American operation to the SAP enterprise resource planning system, which commenced January 1, 2010. It is previously estimated that such advanced purchases resulted in an increase of approximately 4% to 6% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 and a similar decrease in sales in the first quarter of 2010. Such advanced purchases should be taken into account in evaluating our results.  Despite the buy-in in the fourth quarter of 2009, gross sales in the fourth quarter of 2010 are higher than in the fourth quarter of 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2010, gross sales were $364.1 million as compared to $329.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, an increase of 10.5%. We believe that the buy-in in the 2010 fourth quarter for Mexico was not material. Sales of Peace Tea and Worx Energy also contributed to the increase in sales in the fourth quarter of 2010.  We continue to grow for the Monster Energy brand in the United States in 2010 over the prior year despite lower sales in 2010 of Monster Hitman energy shots and Java Monster, X-Presso Monster speaks to the strength of the Monster Energy brand. Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 16% to $1.213 billion for the 2010 year from $1.045 billion for the same period in 2009. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment decreased 7% to $91.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2010. These are the year figures for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared with $98.2 million for the same period in 2009. So these are annual figures that I just referred to between DSD and Warehouse.  In the 12 months ended December 31, 2010, gross sales to retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers represent 5.7% of gross sales, down from 6.5% last year. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represent 11.9% of sales, up from 11.8% last year. Gross sales to full-service distributors represent 63.8% of sales, down from 66.3% in the same period last year. Other sales were 2.5% for the period compared to 2.7% last year.  Gross sales outside the United States increased to 16.1% from 12.8% in the same period last year. Gross sales to customers outside of the United States in the fourth quarter of 2010 amounts to $66.4 million, compared to $43.3 million in the same quarter last year and $69.8 million in the third quarter of 2010. Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the 12 months ended December 31, 2010, amounted to $240.6 million compared to $168 million in 2009. Included in such sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and then transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.  Gross profit margin achieved in the fourth quarter of 2010 was 51.6% versus 53.4% in the comparable quarter last year, and 51.9% in the third quarter of 2010. The reduction in our overall gross margin was partly due to sales within the DSD segment of products, which have lower gross profit margins, particularly Peace Tea and geographic mix particularly of sales internationally, including Europe and Australia, achieved lower gross margin than in North America. The reduction in overall gross margin was also partly attributable to higher off-invoice and promotional allowances, as well as increased cost of goods including raw materials in both the DSD and Warehouse divisions and production variances. Off-invoice, MDF and chain CMAs, as a percentage of net sales, were higher in the fourth quarter of 2010 than in the same period last year.  We have adequate inventory of apple juice concentrate for 2011 and have covered a limited portion of our anticipated requirements for aluminum cans for 2011, as well as a large portion of our anticipated requirements for sugar. In light of the volatility in both commodities in world markets and the unrest in North Africa and the Middle East that we have seen recently, we do anticipate increases in the cost of raw materials in 2011.  Distribution expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were slightly higher than in the same period last year. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 12.2% in the quarter compared to 10.4% in the same period last year. Sponsorship and endorsement costs incurred by us in the fourth quarter were approximately $3.1 million higher than in the comparable period last year, and were also higher as a percentage of net sales.  Costs of promotional coupons, merchandise displays, point-of-sale and premiums were also considerably higher in the quarter than in the comparable quarter last year. Increased cost for our sampling teams, as well as our trade development sales personnel particularly in Europe, also contributed to the increase in such costs. We have a unique opportunity to establish and develop the Monster Energy brand internationally, and to this end, believe that it’s necessary for us to continue to invest in the brand internationally.  For example, in the United Kingdom and in certain overseas countries, our distribution partners do not operate a full-service direct store delivery system to stores in all channels, particularly small independent stores like our full-service distribution partners do in United States. Consequently, to ensure that our product get to the small independent stores, which is an important channel for us, it is necessary for us to supplement our distribution partners' sales forces with our own trade development sales personnel to call on service and merchandise such selected [ph] stores.  Even though we incurred increased cost in consequent to this program, we believe that it is in the best interest of the brand based on the positive results achieved by us to date, not only to continue, but in fact, to extend that program in United Kingdom and selected countries in Europe and elsewhere and are currently doing so.  Similarly, to increase awareness of our products in new international markets, we have undertaken extensive sampling activities as compared to the United States, again, at increased cost. However, we similarly believe that such activities will play an important role in the development and establishment of our brand in those countries. The cost of product sampling teams and trade development personnel are included by us as part of selling expenses and do not fall part of our payroll costs.  General and administrative costs, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 10.2% from 9.4% in the same period last year. The increase in general and administrative costs was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses of $3.1 million and increased expenditures of $2.5 million for professional service fees, including legal and accounting costs.  In the fourth quarter, Europe, Australia and Brazil combined incurred a much-reduced operating loss. Such combined losses were a marked improvement over the combined operating losses that were incurred in the comparable quarter in 2009 as well as the prior quarter in 2010. As indicated earlier, Europe achieved a fairly breakeven position on a currency-neutral basis.  For the 12 months ended December 31, 2010, sponsorship and endorsement costs were approximately $11.2 million higher this year than in 2009, and they're also higher as a percentage of net sales. Operating income for the 12 months ended December 31, 2010, was also negatively affected by increased expenditures of $13.4 million for professional service fees, including legal and accounting costs, and increased cost of point-of-sale materials of $6.2 million, and product sampling teams and trade development sales personnel of $4.5 million. Included in the legal and accounting costs in the 2009 comparable period, was a $4.7 million credit related to reimbursements to the company of legal expenses previously paid by the company.  Our effective tax rate in the 2010 fourth quarter was 38.7% compared to 38.3% in the 2009 fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010, was 39.3% compared to 37.8% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in tax rates as compared to the comparable fourth quarter and 12 months last year, as the case may be, was primarily attributable to the increase in tax rates from a one-time, noncash charge that was incurred in the second quarter to establish a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to the foreign subsidiary, its related impact on the company's overall tax rate, lower state tax benefits and their release of a FIN 48 liability in the 2009 fourth quarter. The increase in tax rate was partially offset by the increase in tax benefits from the domestic production deduction.  Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $354.8 million compared to $328.3 million at December 31, 2009. Short-term investments were $244.6 million as compared to $18.5 million at December 31, 2009. Long-term investments decreased from $80.8 million at December 31, 2009, to $44.2 million. Included in the short-term and long-term investments are Auction Rate Securities of $68.3 million.  Trade accounts receivables, net, decreased to $101.2 million from $104.2 million at December 31, 2009. Days outstanding for receivables were 27.3 days at December 31, 2010, compared to 31.4 days at December 31, 2009. Inventories increased to $153.2 million from $108.1 million at December 31, 2009. Inventories at the end of 2009 were lower due to our transition to the SAP enterprise resource planning system the beginning of January 2010. Average days of inventory were 89.4 days at December 31, 2010, which is higher than the 71.8 days of inventory at December 31, 2009.  I would now like to open the floor to questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with UBS Investment Banking.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank: First question, would you say it's possible the combination of SAP pull forward and the impacts of the marketing change was greater than 4% to 6%?
Rodney Sacks: We still think it's probably in the 6% area, but that's really where we are. That's as much as we've sort of focused on it.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank: But it's difficult to know for sure, correct?
Rodney Sacks: Yes.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank: Second thing, on the selling expense. How fixed is that selling expense line? Is there a leverage story in there that will roughly run around the $80 million range or is that something that should fluctuate?
Rodney Sacks: The revenue expense differential -- you're talking about the...
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank: The SG&A.
Rodney Sacks: Well, SG&A was I think around $84 million. That's really hard to say. Obviously, going forward, we are trying to keep our promotional and endorsement costs and that sort of marketing line level and to, obviously, leverage increased sales against that in the 2011 year. But it's just difficult for us to say. We’re obviously -- we're also relooking at our payroll in the light of the increased cost and just looking at how we deal with it. And we think that legal costs were probably extraordinarily high in 2010, and we think we may be able to see lower costs going forward again. But these are in the hands of lawyers and litigation and things that arise, which sometimes are out of our control. But we do have some extensive litigation regarding a trademark in a number of other areas in 2010.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank: For the Auction Rate Securities, are there any expenses in that SG&A line that are one-time as it relates to the ARS at all?
Rodney Sacks: I don't think so.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank: And then just the last one is, how big was Hitman last year?
Rodney Sacks: Hitman was about -- it was about $21 million in '09 and was about three launches. The variance was about $17.5 million.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Just going back to the U.S. sales numbers, other than just maybe underestimating the pull-forward number, are there any other differences in terms of why Nielsen numbers would show 18% or so for Monster growth and you're reporting 4% number?
Rodney Sacks: Nielsen is different to our number. We report our numbers to our customers. In some cases, we have some direct sales to stores. In most cases, our numbers are sales to basically our wholesalers and distributors. So there is a difference in timing, which we really just can't speak to. But if we make some allowance for the buy-in in 2009, and we've done sort of our own calculation. But again, it's not a fixed figure, which is what we were talking about just a couple of minutes ago. The increase is probably closer to where we estimate around the 12% level, which doesn't account for a large portion of that difference that you've referred to. But again, what we are seeing is a substantially improved position, which I'll refer to later in the call in my closing remarks regarding the sales in the first two months of this year, which do show an increased trend perhaps at/or above the Nielsen numbers. But I'll get to that a bit later when I sum up the results.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And then just internationally, can you help us just kind of think about -- if you look at 2010, your sales growth internationally, how much of that was just really new market expansion as opposed to existing markets that you've been in for more than a year?
Rodney Sacks: I can tell you, for example, the U.K. market, we had a lot of good growth in the U.K. market, which is one of the larger markets that we're in for more than a year. Canada, we're up very much in Canada year-over-year. As I said, I indicated we had a bit of a disruption in Mexico. But I think that our actual sales in Mexico, which is different -- our customer sales in Mexico were higher in the year. So sales generally in this -- what I'd call the more established markets have continued to increase. There are a couple of markets in Europe where there were sales. The increases were a little lower than we would have liked, and we're taking steps to address those. But by and large, the established markets did increase sales. So it's not all being driven by new markets. In fact, the majority are being driven by the existing markets.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And then just on Mexico, the tax increases that you've talked about and then the caffeine change that you're making, so what would be the net impact in terms of -- are you able to then not have to have pass on [ph] any of the tax increases because you won't...
Rodney Sacks: We feel that by making the adjustment, because we have the largest size, we still have efficacy in our product with that and the other ingredients. And we believe that by making the adjustment we did that our products are not subject to the 25% tax. So we believe that will be positive for the brand.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Got it. And then just finally, on the gross margin. So obviously, the combination of geographic and the product mix has been a drag to your gross margin. As you look out 2011, you've also talked about commodities. So is the level of gross margin pressure in 2011, would you say that would be greater just on the commodity side? And are there any plans to offset that with pricing going forward?
Hilton Schlosberg: I think the key is regarding pricing. And at this time, we have taken out pricing in our Warehouse division. But on the energy side or the DSD side, we have no plans at this time to increase pricing.
Rodney Sacks: So we've taken up marginal pricing in Europe.
Hilton Schlosberg: Yes, generally. As regards to cost, Judy, there will be some impact on margin with regard to cost. And that's something that we, at this time, we just don't want to talk about frankly.
Rodney Sacks: We will see what the rest of the industry does as we go through the year, as we leave ourselves flexible to reevaluate that as we go forward. So it's not as though whatever decision we make, we're going stay with right through the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alton Stump with Longbow Research.
Unidentified Analyst: This is actually [indiscernible] calling in for Alton. I just had two quick questions. Kind of going off of Judy's question just with aluminum. If you could talk a little bit about what percentage you exactly have covered? Or if aluminum does move from here, is there going to be a need to take, kind of, more pricing than maybe you implied?
Hilton Schlosberg: We've covered a very small proportion of aluminum for 2011. What happened was that aluminum was about the $115 level. And after the turmoil in the Middle East, it increased to $120 level. But as you know, it may go back. It may not go back. We understand that there are hedge funds with substantial inventories sitting in warehouses. And we took a decision late last year that we will just see what happens with aluminum pricing, and we are continuing to monitor that situation. In Europe, our pricing is fixed. We fixed our pricing for aluminum cans in Europe.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So I'm going to just make a statement, and I'm just curious whether you would agree with it. It sounds like to me that you guys reinvested back into the business at a rate, I think, greater than we have seen in the past. And it sounds like to me, you would do that basically because you got a better visibility than what you printed in terms of the top line and your outlook for sales going forward. Do you think that's a fair statement?
Rodney Sacks: Reasonably accurate, yes.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And then shifting a bit to the cash position, it's just piling up. I'm curious given that you're going to have a nice opportunity to be in the market buying stock over the next few days here. Is that something that you're looking to do at an increasing rate basically compared to what we've seen in the past couple of years, where I think you've been in the market a little bit but you clearly have a lot of opportunities to be in there buying more if you wanted to?
Hilton Schlosberg: I think that we have indicated that we are clearly going to go into the market. We are looking at buying back, but we also just want to see what happens. And we'll make a decision as we -- virtually from day-to-day. Because we need to see where the market is, where the share price is and we'll just, obviously, try to make a prudent decision. But we acknowledge that we do have a lot of cash, and we do want to actually use it to buy back stock.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: But that remains the primary use of cash, right?
Rodney Sacks: Correct. Correct.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And just finally, what was the contribution from Worx and Peace Tea in the fourth quarter?
Rodney Sacks: It's somewhere in the -- about the $7 million mark.
Hilton Schlosberg: You're talking about sales, or you're talking about distribution [ph]?
Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: [indiscernible] Say that again?
Rodney Sacks: It's about $7 million.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And that was Peace Tea or Worx?
Rodney Sacks: Both.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Both were $7 million or total of $7 million?
Rodney Sacks: Total for the two.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Actually, just finally, I know you don't give guidance, but in terms of the spend level in the first quarter, how are you thinking about that? It sounds like I guess a read between the lines in terms of the support for the international business is that you're going to have the selling and distribution expenses remain sort of in line at least in terms of an absolute dollar amount in the first quarter. Does that seem about right?
Rodney Sacks: It's about right. We started to, obviously, spend in particularly in a lot of the countries where we launched late last year. In Europe, we had, obviously, we have to get point-of-sale and other things -- incur other costs pretty much in advance. Similarly, [ph] you have to advance of launching new products, whether it be Worx and Rehab, et cetera. So obviously, we have made quite a lot of investment in coolers and a lot of these point-of-sale. We, obviously, are trying to keep that down. And hopefully, we'll be able to keep that reasonably flat going forward in the first quarter.
Hilton Schlosberg: I think in our cost, other than coolers, we expense in the year in which the product is purchased.
Rodney Sacks: Period, yes. So a lot of that was written off in the fourth quarter.
Hilton Schlosberg: That's correct.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with CLSA.
Michael Lavery - Sidoti & Company: Just wondering, I know you've talked about this a little bit, so is it something like you've got a de-load that you've already seen coming back the other way in the first quarter in the U.S.? And how do we think about where that sits versus Nielsen? Is it useful to compare with that in mind as we think about the scanner data?
Rodney Sacks: Perhaps you're right. I was going to probably -- it will give you some sort of indication. Although we haven't yet closed the -- obviously, we still got some days and we got deliveries still to work out exactly what we deliver to the end of February. But pretty much, our sales in the company for the first two months of 2011 over 2010 are up in excess -- or expected to be close the month in excess of 50% higher than last year. If you do an adjustment for the buy-in and just using rough figure of about $20 million, it still leaves us well up over 35%, in excess of 35% higher than in 2010 after that adjustment for allowing for that. And that's what I referred earlier to in response to Judy, where I said that in fact, the timing is not exactly something we can account for. But certainly, we are seeing the increased momentum, and we are seeing the increased sales, which we're obviously pleased to see coming in -- in the first quarter of this year. And we're just now really starting the advertising for Worx, and we're hoping to see some response to that. And then obviously, we feel quite good about the new Monster Rehab brand, which we are launching in March.
Michael Lavery - Sidoti & Company: And up about 35% would be for just the U.S. or on a total company basis?
Rodney Sacks: That's on the company basis, in excess of 35%. So that's our estimate at this time.
Michael Lavery - Sidoti & Company: On then on the margin side, I understand the way that the international expansion is margin dilutive with investments ahead of the sales. But how do we think about when that turns? Is there a lot of that in place already? Or as far as some of the investment going, is it midstream or just getting started? Or how did the timing compare to when the sales should be expected to come in?
Rodney Sacks: It's hard. It also depends on the timing of where we launch in different countries, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe this year. But we launched in a number of countries late last year, which was Switzerland, Austria, Bulgaria. We are planning to launch a number of countries going forward in Central and Eastern Europe this year, the first part of the year. And it's necessary for us to, obviously, incur costs in advance of that, whether it's payroll cost, setting up. There are a number of costs that go in advance. So it’ll all depend on where we end up. And if we end up doing most of the new launches in the beginning of the year, you'll end up with those costs now. They're not repeatable. But if we start and we find it opportune and appropriate to get into some of the bigger Eastern European countries that we are looking at later in the year, then we may have that investment going forward. But I think that as we continue to increase our sales in Europe and internationally, the effect of those sort of proprietary expenditures will start having a smaller effect as our base continues to increase, which is what we are seeing now. Because we're starting to see some nice numbers coming out of Europe, which is really starting to level off the cost of these sort of anomalies that we have seen in the last year to 18 months. Again, I just wanted to reiterate again, so the numbers I'm saying refer to the adjusted sales on a company-wide basis, and that we are saying that we anticipate the first months being in excess of 35%, that is after making basically an allowance of a figure of approximately $20 million for the buy-in in '09 to try and normalize that.
Operator: And there are no further audio questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to management for any closing remarks.
Rodney Sacks: In closing, again, we basically -- the indications I gave you of the two months should not be taken as indicative of where we're going to end up in the quarter. I mean, we just don't know. We're obviously trying, and to some extent, even see how we're going to end up the second month of the year, which is February. But obviously, we are pleased with the results to date and the direction that we seem to be heading. And the general market has been doing quite nicely in the energy drink market.  So all round, we are positive going forward. As we indicated in the call, again, I reiterate we have done some advance spending. And obviously, we'd like to try and get that, manage it more carefully, which we are proposing to do going forward. But the principle focus for us is to make sure the brand is healthy and it continues to grow. And that for us is important as a company, looking at the long-term health of the brand.  Thank you, once again, for your support. And hopefully, it's not a long time. And hopefully, we'll be reporting our results the beginning of May for the first quarter. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude that Hansen Natural Corporation Fourth quarter and Year End 2010 Financial Results Conference Call. We thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2010 Q3  (2010-11-04 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Rodney Sacks - Chief Chairman and CEO Hilton Schlosberg - President, CFO
Analysts: Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus
Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Hansen Natural Corporation third quarter 2010 financial results conference call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode, following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chief Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.
Rodney Sacks: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for taking this call. I'm Rodney Sacks, Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President is with me today, as he becomes Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of our Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance, and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on management's current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made herein. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2010, and our most recent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, including the sections contained therein entitled risk factors and forward-looking statements for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measures of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated November 4, 2010. A copy of this information is also available on our website, www.hansens.com in the Investor Relations Section. We are continuing to see an improvement in the beverage market in general in North America and certain countries internationally. In particular, the energy category is building momentum with increased growth, principally in the important convenience and gas store channel, and to a lesser degree in the grocery and drug channels. That said, the macro environment continues to be challenging, as we still face economic uncertainty and high unemployment levels in the United States and many of the other countries in which we are selling Monster, and which appears to be keeping a consumer lead recovery at bay in many regions, particularly in developed markets such as the United States and Europe, which includes the U.K. While we believe these conditions are likely to persist, we are confident that we will be able to continue to grow the Monster brand. Our ability to accelerate profitable growth in this quarter demonstrates our ability to leverage the significant opportunities available to the Monster brand. We will also continue to focus on innovation and introduce new products to the marketplace. During the third quarter, we launched Monster Energy Absolutely Zero to address increased consumer demand for zero calorie beverage products. We are enthusiastic about the prospects for Absolutely Zero, and since its launch, Absolutely Zero has been well received by distributors, retail customers and consumers. During the quarter, we also introduced Monster Energy Import Light, which is a lower calorie version of our Monster Energy Import Energy drink in 18.6 ounce BRE which is a Ball Re-sealable End cans, which has also been well received by the market. We also introduced a Dub Edition Monster Energy drink in that package, which we believe will enable us to achieve greater preserves and visibility on store sales for our three packages in the 18.6 ounce BRE Re-sealable can size. To facilitate the introduction of new products for 2011, we are planning to launch a number of new products in the fourth quarter of this year, these products include Monster M3, which is a super concentrate Monster Energy drink in a 5-ounce glass bottle, as well as a new energy shot under the WORX brand name, WORX is spell W-O-R-X, which will be launched in 2-ounce bottles in two variants, original and extra strength. During the fourth quarter, we are planning to reposition our Java Monster line by replacing three flavors with new improved flavors as well as discontinuing to Java Monster flavors. And we are also introducing X-Presso Monster in a larger 12-ounce slim can and adding a new X-Presso Monster product called Midnight. We believe that an additional X-Presso Monster SKU together with the use of a larger sized can will improve the visibility on shelf of our original 6.7-ounce single X-Presso Monster product, which was packaged in a small 8-ounce can. During the fourth quarter, we are also planning to reposition our Nitrous Monster Energy line to better communicate it's attributes to consumers, as Monster Energy extra strength that utilizes Nitrous technology.
 : Sales of our Peace Tea line of iced teas continue to be solid, and we introduced two additional SKUs in that line, mainly a diet green tea and an unsweetened tea in the third quarter. We are planning to introduce a tea lemonade combination in that line in 2011. I wish to point out that the actual dates for these various planned introductions could change if for example any production issues arise and/or depending on ongoing discussions that we are having with distribution partners as to the most appropriate dates for launching these products. Turning now to the energy drink category, the growth in the energy drink category including shots accelerated in the third quarter of 2010. According to the Nielsen for the 13-week through September 25, 2010 all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandise, excluding Wal-Mart, sales in the energy drink category including shots increased 14.9% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 17.1% in the 13-week period concerned, while sales of Red Bull increased by 15.5%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 15%. Sales of 5-Hour Energy increased 73%, sales of Amp dropped 1.3%. Sales of NOS increased 10.2%. Full Throttle decreased 30.6%, and No Fear was down 42.7%. According to the Nielsen reports for the five weeks ending September 25, 2010, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel increased by 16.4% over the comparable five-week period in 2009. Over this five-week period, sales of Monster increased by 17.9% over last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 16.3%. Rockstar was up 17.3%, while Amp was down 0.3%, Full Throttle was down 25.8%. 5-Hour Energy increased 75.6% NOS was up 13% and No Fear was down 41.3%. According to Nielsen for the five weeks ended September 25, 2010, Monster market share of the convenience and gas channel of the energy drink category including energy shots rose to 28% against Red Bull's share of 31.9, 5-Hour Energy's share of 10.6%, and Rockstar's share of 9.7%. According to Nielsen in dollars, sales in the energy drink category for all outlets combined increased by $207.9 million to $1.6 billion in the 13 weeks ended September 25, 2010. Sales of Monster increased by $62.9 million as compared to Red Bull which increased by $69.9 million. 5-Hour Energy which increased by $71.4 million and sales of Rockstar, which increased by $20.6 million. Sales of Amp decreased by $1.2 million, sales of NOS increased by 5.1 million, while sales of Full Throttle dropped by $15.8 million. According to Nielsen, sales of Java Monster represented approximately 10.7% of the sales of the Monster brand for the 13 weeks through September 25, 2010, which is a decrease of 2.3 percentage points from 13% in the same period last year. As reported previously, we believe that the decline in sales of Java Monster is primarily attributable due to the entry of Starbucks into this subcategory in the middle of the second quarter of 2008 with its new line of Doubleshot Energy Plus Coffee drinks in 15-ounce cans, which compete directly with Java Monster. This resulted in Java Monster having to share that subcategory with the Starbucks line. However, the positive news is that according to Nielsen, sales in the subcategory on an overall basis are continuing to grow. In the 13 weeks ended September 25, 2010, for all outlets combined, sales of ready to drink energy plus coffee drinks increased 1.9% over the same period last year. According to Nielsen, sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy increased 26.4% in the current period compared to Rockstar Roasted, which is down 24%, and Full Throttle coffee, which is down 67.2%. Although, sales of Java Monster are reflected in the Nielsen numbers, as 3.6% lower than last year, our sales of Java Monster in this quarter to our customers are in fact higher than in the comparable quarter last year. In general, we are progressing satisfactorily internationally. Turning to the Canadian market, I can report that we are continuing to see substantial improvements in both sales and market share for Monster in Canada. According to Nielsen in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended September 25, 2010, the energy drink category grew 19%, while sales of Monster grew 51% over last year. Monster's market share increased 5.4 points over the same period last year to 25.5%, while Red Bulls share decreased 1.3 points to 37.5%, and Rockstar's market share increased by 1.7 points to 13.9%. According to Nielsen, sales of Monster energy in Mexico in September 2010 grew 8% over the last year while sales of Red Bull declined 17.9%. Sales of Monster's nearest as a competitor which is the lower price energy drink Gladiator were 8.7% lower than last year. Monster's market share in Mexico in September 2010 increased by 3.8 points to 29.8%, which excludes Java Monster. We are continuing to work with our distributor in Mexico to address the specific channels in which the lower priced Gladiator energy drink products compete with Monster. For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, sales of Monster products to our distributor in Mexico were lower than sales in Mexico in the same period last year, primarily due to the disruption that occurred when we terminated our distributor in the Baja area of Mexico earlier this year. Sales in Mexico during the third quarter were in fact higher than in the comparable 2009 quarter. We believe that such disruption is now behind us, and that we are making up lost ground in Mexico. However, during the course of the last few weeks, the Mexican legislature has proposed a 25% tax on energy drinks sold in Mexico. If it is implemented, we believe this tax will have a dampening effect on the energy category from the beginning of 2011, when this tax is scheduled to be introduced. We intend to monitor the potential implementation of this law and the decisions and to actions of our main competitors in that market before we make the final decision on our strategy for Mexico in 2011 to deal with this challenge. Sales of Monster in the United Kingdom and Europe continue to make good progress. Sale in Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia also continuing to perform satisfactorily. In the third quarter of 2010 net sales in Europe in U.S. dollars are more than 156% higher than in the comparable quarter in 2009. Although sponsorship expenses, sampling, points of sale costs, as well as payroll costs in Europe continue to be high, as we leverage our increased sales in Europe, we have been able to reduce those costs on a per case basis to the point that in the third quarter we achieved a breakeven position in Europe on a currency neutral basis. We are hopeful that the region will start contributing to profits in 2011. During the third quarter of 2010, we launched the Monster Energy drink brand in Germany, Europe's second largest energy drink market. United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, Jordan and Tahiti, we are in a process of launching Monster in Switzerland, Australia, and Iceland and are planning to launch Monster Energy in Bulgaria before the end of the year. Sales of Monster are continuing to progress in Central America, European (ph) Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti and South Africa. We are working through the importation and production issues that we faced in Brazil, and look forward to increasing Monster's market penetration and sales in Brazil in 2011. We are continuing to work with our distribution partner in Australia to implement programs that have worked elsewhere with a view to improving Monster's market share in that country. We plan to expand the sales of Monster into Asia in 2011, and to this end have appointed a Vice President International for the Asia region, who will be based in Hong Kong from the end of this year. We are continuing to focus on expanding sales of Monster into new countries in South America, as well as into new countries in Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, in 2011. Monster Energy drinks continue to achieve record sales during the quart quarter. Net sales volumes of our Java Monster product line in the third quarter are slightly higher than in the comparable quarter last year. Net sales of our new Peace Tea brand continue to gain strength that we are approximately 9.1 million in the third quarter of 2010. The increase in sales of Monster was partially offset by decreased sales of X-Presso Monster. We have previously referred to advanced purchases made by our customers in the fourth quarter of 2009, due to our announcement of a new per case marketing contribution program for Monster Energy distributors commencing January 1, 2010, as well as to avoid potential interruptions in product supply due to our announcements to transition our North American operation to the SAP Enterprise Resource Planning System, which commenced January 1, 2010. We estimated that the negative impact of such advanced purchases was approximately 4% to 6% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2009. Although, advanced purchases did not negatively impact third quarter 2010 results, we believe that they did negatively impact the results for the nine months ended September 30, 2010. In evaluating sales and earnings for the fourth quarter of 2010, we believe that it is important that analysts and shareholders take such advanced purchases into account as the volume that was experienced in the fourth quarter of last year will not be repeated in the fourth quarter of this year, and the absence thereof will negatively affect any comparison of sales and earnings in the fourth quarter of this year when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. For the three months ended September 30, 2010, gross sales to retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 5% of gross sales, down from 6% last year. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represent 13% of sales up from 12% last year. Gross sales to full service distributors represented 63% of sales down from 65% in the same period last year. Other sales were 3% for both periods. Gross sales outside the United States increased to 16% from 14% in the same period last year. Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the third quarter of 2010 amounted to $69.8 million, compared to $50 million in the same quarter last year, and $66.6 million in the second quarter of 2010, included in such sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and then trans-shipped to the military and their customers overseas. Due to the redeployment of troops in Iraq, our sales to the military in Iraq was down on last year. Although, other regions have shown increases. Gross profit margin in the third quarter of 2010 was 51.9%, versus 53.6% in the comparable quarter last year, and 52.9% in the second quarter of 2010. The reduction in our overall gross margin was partly due to sales within the DSD segment of products which have lower gross profit margins, particularly Peace Tea, and geographic mix, particularly of sales internationally, including Europe and Australia achieved lower gross margins than in North America. The reduction in overall gross margin was also partly attributable to excessive off (ph) invoice and promotional allowances, as well as increased costs of goods incurred by the warehouse segment in the third quarter of 2010, as well as the impact of sales of closeout inventories and certain other promotional activities. Off invoice, MDF and chain CMAs as a percentage of net sales was slightly lower in the third quarter of 2010, than in the same period last year. We have not yet covered our anticipated requirements for aluminum cans for 2011, although, we have covered part of our anticipated requirements for sugar. In light of the current commodity market, we anticipate increases in the cost of raw materials in 2011. Distribution expense as a percentage of net sales was slightly higher than in the same period last year. Sponsorship and endorsement costs incurred by us were approximately 1.1 million higher than in the comparable period last year, but were lower as a percentage of net sales, although, selling expenses were higher than in the same period last year, selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were lower in the third quarter of 2010, than in the comparable period of 2009. The increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to increased expenditures of $6.5 million for professional service fees, including legal and accounting costs. The 2009 comparable period included a credit of $4.7 million from the reimbursement to the company of legal expenses previously paid by the company. Operating results from Europe, Australia, and Brazil reflect a marginal loss in the third quarter, which is a substantial improvement on the operating loss that was incurred in previous quarters in 2010 and 2009. Europe achieved a breakeven position on a currency neutral basis. Operating income includes operating losses of $1.6 million, and $0.4 million related to (inaudible) LLC for the three months ended September 30, 2010, as compared to September 30, 2009 respectively, and 2.1 million related to extracting for the three months ended September 30, 2009. We intend to limit our participation, as a promoter in these types of events in the future. Our effective tax rate for the 2010 third quarter was 38.1%, compared to 39.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2009, versus 42% for the second quarter of 2010. The decrease in tax rates is compared to the comparable quarter last year was primarily attributable to the increase in tax benefits related to the domestic production, deduction, and the decrease in tax rates from the second quarter was primarily the result of a one-time non-cash charge that was incurred in the second quarter to establish a full valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset related to a foreign subsidiary and it's related impact on the company's overall tax rate. We continue to make progress in the implementation of the SAP Enterprise Resource Planning System, which was introduced on January 1, 2010, while we believe that delays in filling deliveries and lost sales have significantly reduced since the first quarter, we are unable to quantify what the impact has been, however, we continue to believe that the impact was relatively minor and that the change to SAP will ultimately be beneficial for the company overall. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $509.6 million, compared to $328.3 million at December 31, 2009. Short-term investments were $24.2 million, as compared to $18.5 million at December 31, 2009. Long-term investments decreased from $80.8 million at December 31, 2009, to $46 million, included in short and long-term investments are auction rate securities of $70.2 million. Trade accounts receivables net increased from $113.9 million from $104.2 million at December 31, 2009. Days outstanding for receivables were 29.7 days at the September 30, 2010, compared to 31.4 days at December 31, 2009. Inventories increased to 148.9 million from 108.1 million at December 31, 2009, average days of inventory was 73 days at September 30, 2010, which is higher than the 71.8 days of inventory at December 31, 2009. In March 2010, the company introduced an agreement relating to 54.2 million core value auction rate securities, which enables the company to sell such securities to put option in semiannual or annual installments giving March 22, 2011, with full sale rights available on or up to March 22, 2013. Such auction rate securities, which are been reclassified from available for sale to trading securities will continue to accrue interest until redeemed through either the put option, or by the auction process, or by the terms outlined in their respective prospectuses in the event of auction failure. At September 30, 2010, the company held auction rate securities with a face value of $81.5 million, which was $87.3 million at June 30, 2010 and 92.7 million at March 31, 2010, and the put option with that same market value of $3.8 million, which was $4.1 million at June 30, 2010, and $5.1 million at March 31 2010. The company determined that an impairment related to its auction rate securities of $7.2 million existed at September 30, 2010, of which $2.2 million was deemed temporary, and $5 million was deemed other than temporary. As a result, a loss of $1.2 million net of taxes is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss as of September 30, 2010, and the company reported a net non-cash charge to earnings of $0.7 million in respect to the auction rate securities and put option for the third quarter of 2010. The auction rate securities will continue to accrue interest at their contractual rates until their respective auctions succeed or they are redeemed. I would like to open the floor to questions. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Thanks. Hi, Rodney. My first question is, in terms of the U.S. sales it looks like if I backed out the international sales U.S. was up around 20% to 23%, which is a little bit above the convenience and the all channel data that we've seen, which shows up about 18%. So, is there a little bit of disconnect there, and what do you think is the difference in terms of your shipment numbers and kind of what we're seeing in the consumer takeaway data?
Rodney Sacks: You know, we always end up tracking slightly higher or slightly lower than Nielsen. We have commented on it many times. You know, there are timing differences in inventory, stocking differences that our distributors have. It may just depend on the timing, where you have sort of holiday weekends where you close your quarters, but we generally find that there is a difference, we report our own sales. In this case, it's slightly higher than our Nielsen numbers are reflecting.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then in terms of the fourth quarter, you've called out the benefit of the buy-in that you saw in the fourth quarter. It sounds like you have a lot of new products that you're introducing though in the fourth quarter. So, is there some level of benefit that you would also get in terms of the fourth quarter because of a lot of these new products, or is that not a meaningful driver in terms of the year-over-year benefit?
Rodney Sacks: In some of them, they really are small tweaks, we really are just repositioning and tweaking some products. Others that we are sort of driving out and you will get initial sales, but it also will depend on the timing, because some of them will come out very, very close to the end of the period. You know, a lot of these things we are sort of talking to our distributors to work with them on when the most, sensible windows will, you know, open up our different products, because also distributors have and bottles in the curve but they all have other products that we are introducing as well, as they continue to go through the Christmas and New Year seasons. And so, at this point in time, it's really it's something, it's very odd for us to really predict. We can only tell you what our sort of intentions and plans are, and they'll be as they, whatever they are.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then on the cost side, you have called out potentially higher costs on 2011, given the raw material increases. Can you help us with some perspective on what level of increase you are looking at, given where the spot prices are today, and then is there some plan to take pricing to offset some of this, the raw material costs?
Rodney Sacks: At the moment, we generally don't cover extensively. That's just been the way we have normally traded. We look at opportunities, as we go through the year to see what happens with the pricing, and we do sometimes lock in pricing if we see it has moved down at the moment. It has moved up and we are sort of just sitting on the sideline. It may well move down before, and then we will lock in some pricing, but we just have a flexible, we don't have a fixed policy in this regard. We just really are seeing some, prices of the commodities, being higher, and so, we just sort of, clearly just sort of wanted to make that point so that everybody understood that. And so, going forward, we're just not sure, where we'll be in that area.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then, my final question is just in terms of your sales expense, selling expenses, it sounds like it's the second quarter in a row where you got some pretty nice leverage in terms of the selling expenses, as a percent of sales coming down. Are we at a point where now the spending level is actually stable enough that you would see the benefit going forward in terms of getting something positive operating leverage? You've talked about Europe breaking even at this point. It sounds like other markets could potentially improve in terms of the profitability, so I'm just wondering if this 10% or 11% selling expenses, as a percent of sales is a kind of reasonable sustainable number.
Rodney Sacks: You know, we sort of don't give any future direction. We're not sure, we're just not sure what we're going to do next year in the sense of, we're looking at Asia, depends on when we get into Asia, and what extent we need to feel that we need to support the brands there. We're going to launch WORX, WORX we're going to advertise through the traditional advertising that is our strategy for the WORX shot brand. So that will result in sort of higher expenditure than early, sort of, part of the large cycle of the brand. So, things keep on changing, but I think the point you're making is correct. If you look at our actual DSD division, although, we had a lower gross margin, we were able to manage our oil operating expense item line all the way through to the point that we ended up with our contribution marginal operating income for our DSD division for the quarter, being almost the same percentage as last year. And so, we were able to bring some of those savings to the bottom line, between selling and total operating. So, we are trying to sort of make sure that as we continue to grow in new countries, we will try and continue to keep that in line, but I don't think that we can sort of take a sort of a direction from this to say that it's going to continue to improve. It's going to change from quarter-to-quarter, depending on the rate of our development and launch in new markets. That will have an effect, we believe, the main effect on us we have to keep cost, but obviously, we are hopeful to be able to continue to deliver bottom line in the warehouse, DSD division at least as high or better than in the past. Some of the loss of margin we incurred and increase expenses this quarter was attributable to the warehouse division. We ended up with a much lower contribution margin than in the comparable quarter last year, and we obviously are going to address that going forward.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay.
Rodney Sacks: But again, I want to caution again that we really are concerned, because we do not give guidance, and I just don't want to be put into a position where we are actually starting to give any guidance in this regard.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. That's fair. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala from UBS. Please go ahead.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: Hi guys. I guess the first question, did you buyback any shares in the quarter?
Rodney Sacks: No, we didn't.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: And is your current authorization full, or is there any reason why you have not?
Rodney Sacks: No, we have capacity, the authorization is in existence, we just didn't buyback in the quarter. We are going to review that again, and that's just a factor that we'll take into account the share prices and other factors and then make a decision.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: Got it. And then, on the tax rate for this quarter, is this the appropriate tax rate or was there any one times in there, we should consider or thinking about the next couple of quarters?
Rodney Sacks: I think this is reasonable. Again, it's changed in the last two quarter, you've seen some jumps in that, but this is in the sort of general ballpark area of where we see it going forward.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: Okay. Got it. And then last question on Europe. How long, at least in the existing markets, do you think before you get to appropriate run rate on margins? Obviously crossed over to breakeven, but clearly you'll still have a mixed impact on margins to some degree, so are the existing countries that you've been in expanding it to a degree where for the weight that it had on your overall margin starting to lift, or will the new countries you're rolling into offset most of that?
Rodney Sacks: First, I think the new countries will offset a lot of the costs here, but the actual margins are not affected by going into new countries. The actual margins are what they are in most of the European countries, and they are lower than in the U.S. Where we believe, we will try and pick up some margin, is we are looking at additional production facilities. We recently started producing at the CC plant in Milton Keynes in the U.K., we're looking at an additional plant in Central Europe and quite possibly another plant in northern Italy, or certainly in Southern Europe, and we believe that, using additional plants throughout Europe will help us reduce some of our costs, and in that way improve our margins. But the margins are all over the place. Each country that we are going into now has a very, very different value chain that sort of, there's nothing in that's really standard all in Europe. As you know, one things of Europe as a single continent and some sort of continuity because of the, but there's not. Every single country has different regulations regarding their product, their different formulas in every country and there is different margin chains, and they are very, very considerably, particularly into Central and Eastern Europe. So, in some cases where you have sort of very small, third word countries, you're making nice margins. In others are that you have got a pretty good economy, your margins are down because of a strong presence in that market of a private label or a local brand, which tends to have quite a big influence on the retail sale level. So, it really does fluctuate, but on the whole, we believe that margins will go down a little as we continue to expand into Europe, because there is a compression on the sales level there, and our cost of goods generally as a percentage is higher there. Production costs are higher there than in the U.S.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: Got it. And then just a final question because of the leverage you have got on the selling side, was there anything in the G&A number? Looks like there's a bit of a step up there as well. Thank you.
Rodney Sacks: The G&A, as a percentage was actually down. I'm sorry, I'm maybe speaking, I'm sorry, I'm just getting some, was 23? SG&A. That's not right. G&A was in line with last year. I've got the number here.
Hilton Schlosberg: That's excluding the legal fees on the transaction derivative. And that benefited from 4.7 million credit last year. Strictly general and admin were in line with last year.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: So, G&A was roughly in line when you make the adjustments?
Rodney Sacks: Yes, yes.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mark Astrachan, Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Good afternoon, guys. I guess just following up on that last point, trying to get a sense of what the G&A numbers might look like on a run rate basis. I guess even if sort of normalized but that it looks like the 6.5 million that you are pulling out for professional fees might have been an increase from the prior year. Do any of those or any of those anticipated to go away, or should we think of that as sort of a run rate to use?
Rodney Sacks: I really don't know. It's just that it was, it just seemed to be high in this quarter.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Got it. Okay.
Rodney Sacks: But legal fees are really up predictable. It just depends on when you get to, we filed and dealt with applications to dismiss some of these security class actions and other actions which were successful, and then there were amended complaint on new series that have come out, and so we have now, briefing those applications to dismiss the claims on new grounds. It just depends on when those fall in timing, so it's really hard to predict.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. And in terms of sales that you had by package size, any color on the 24-ounces and above? Are we seeing any sort of improvement in sales there?
Rodney Sacks: 24-ounce, we are see something improvement in recent times. We are seeing an improvement in the 24-ounce can size.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, great. And just finally, in terms of thinking of the opportunity to take pricing not necessarily related to heightened commodity costs, but just in general, you've taken one price increase over the years, it's been a few years now since that, in some cases retailers are selling the Monster product were more than you are essentially selling, I mean they are taking that spread for profit of sales, is there any opportunity that you guys think about in terms of being able to take some pricing, not necessarily on a year-on-year basis, but just could take it on occasion when you feel like you can, when you have some sort of commodity cost benefit that you could sort of pass it through and say we have got to take some pricing here?
Rodney Sacks: At this point, we sort of generally discussed this, and at this point, we haven't made a decision to take pricing up, but we actually have it as an item on the agenda over the next couple of weeks, and so it won't be, it's unlikely to be something we will take up as from January 1 in to our DSD. We may do it. We more likely in January want to take it up in our warehouse division. But it doesn't mean, we won't take it up in the next month or two after that in DSD. We all looking at and are currently reviewing the market and our costs and if we do see a large increase in our raw material costs, I think we will actually look to moving it on little bit.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Great, thanks, and great quarter, guys.
Operator: Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Sacks for concluding remarks.
Rodney Sacks: One of the things I would like to, perhaps, refer to in conclusion is just to go back to the one area, the DSD division, as such, net sales in the DSD division, were up 26.8%, where as the net sales in the warehouse division were down 6.8%. Although, as I indicated earlier the gross profit was slightly lower in the DSD division, it was substantially lower in the warehouse division, but based on the costs that we were able to manage, our operating income really ended up at the same percentage as this period last year. So, we really do believe that it was a good performance. Obviously, we would like to continue to maintain and improve on that performance, but I think it is relevant because of the numbers coming out to show that we all are able to continue to manage our bottom line. We are continuing to look at the management of that item, particularly as we go forward. Obviously, we see the future of the company being able to take advantage of the momentum we already got going in Europe, and Central Europe, so obviously we have our whole infrastructure there so we really want to concentrate on that. South America is another we think good opportunity for our brand. Our brand has already started to do well. We are seeing good response anecdotally from consumers, so we are obviously encouraged and we want to focus on South America. And then obviously, the big question is Asia. It is potentially a very large opportunity for energy drinks, particularly because they've had their traditional types of energy drinks in the market for, decades, and so we believe if we can literally crack the code and convert a reasonable percentage of users to Western, call it Western or new or modern sort of energy drinks, we would have, very, very good potential in Asia. So, we are going to start focusing. We think that's going to be a much longer road, and we'll have to persevere there for a longer for many years, but we do see good long-term opportunity there. So, we are pretty excited by what we've been able to achieve domestically, as well as the international business, and the way it's turning around for us, and growing, and we hope to be able to continue to deliver increased results to our shareholders going forward. Thank you very much.

===== 2010 Q2  (2010-08-05 17:00:00) =====
Executives:  Rodney Sacks – Chairman and CEO Hilton Schlosberg – Vice Chairman and President
Analysts:  Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs Kaumil Gajrawala – UBS Caroline Levy – SLSA Mark Astrachan – Stifel Nicolaus Alec Patterson – RCM

I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Rodney Sacks, Hansen Natural Corporation Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead, sir.
Rodney Sacks: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I am Rodney Sacks.

The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measures of gross sales and certain expenditures which may be mentioned during the course of this call is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated August 5, 2010. A copy of this information is also available on our website, www.hansens.com in the investor relations section. There appeared to have been an improvement in the beverage market in general in North America in second quarter of 2010. While certain sectors are still negative, some are showing positive growth, most notably the energy drinks, both drink and tea categories. Growth in the energy drink category including shots accelerated in the second quarter of 2010 into double digit territory when compared to previous quarters. According to Nielsen, for the 13 weeks through June 26, 2010, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, and mass merchandisers, excluding Wal-Mart, sales in the energy drink category including shots increased 10.8% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 12.7% in the 13-week period concerned while sales of Red Bull increased by 15%. Sales of Rockstar increased 10.3%, sales of Amp dropped 8.2%, sales of NOS increased 7.1%, and sales of Full Throttle dropped 29.3%. According to the Nielsen report for the five weeks ending June 26, 2010, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel as defined by us increased by 12.9% over the comparable five-week period in 2009. Over this five week period, sales of Monster increased by 15.4% over last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 15.7% over last year. Rockstar was up 14.9%, while Amp was down 5.8%. Full Throttle was down 31.1%. No Fear was down 39.7%, while SoBe and Adrenaline Rush were each down in excess of 85%. NOS was up by 8.4%, which was considerably slower than in previous periods. According to Nielsen, for the five weeks ended June 26, 2010, Monster’s market share of the convenience and gas channel of the energy drink category including energy shots was 27.9% against Red Bull’s share of 31.9% and Rockstar’s share of 9.6%. Nielsen numbers for chain convenient stores as reported by our third party for the four weeks ended July 10, 2010 indicated that the momentum of sales increases for both the category of Monster is increased. These numbers reflect that chain convenient store sales grew 11% versus 9% the previous month while sales of Monster grew 19% versus 14% the previous month. In actual dollars, sales in the energy drink category for all outlets combined increased by $142.3 million to $1.5 billion in the 13 weeks ended June 26, 2010. According to Nielsen, sales of Monster increased by $43.9 million as compared to sales of Red Bull, which increased by $62.5 million. Sales of Rockstar increased by $13.4 million, sales of Amp decreased by $7.6 million, sales of NOS increased by $3.3 million, while sales of Full Throttle dropped by $15.4 million. According to Nielsen, sales of Java Monster represented approximately 11.3% of the sales of the Monster brand for the 13 weeks to June 26, 2010, which is a decrease of 1.8 percentage points as compared to 13.1% for the same period last year. The decline in the sales of Java Monster continues to be attributable primarily to the entry of Starbucks into the category in the middle of the second quarter of 2008 with its new line of Doubleshot Energy Plus coffee drinks in 15-ounce cans which compete directly with Java Monster. We are continuing to see increased sales of Loca Moca and Mean Bean, which are the primary packages of our Java Monster line over the comparable 13-week period last year. In the 13 weeks ended June 26, for all outlets combined, sales of the ready-to-drink energy plus coffee drinks increased 3.8% over the same period last year. Java Monster is now only 2.9% lower than last year. Starbucks Doubleshot is up 29.3%. Rockstar Roasted is down 18.7%, and Full Throttle coffee is down 58.2%. We continue to see improvements in both sales and Monster’s market share in Canada. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended June 5, 2010, the energy drink category grew 9% while sales of Monster grew 23%. Monster’s market share increased 2.1 points over the same period last year to 19%, while Red Bull’s share increased to 0.5 point to 38.3% and Rockstar’s market share decreased by 2 points to 14.3%. According to Nielsen, sales of Monster Energy in Mexico in May 2010 grew 13.4% over last year while sales of Red Bull grew 4%. Sales in the energy drink category in Mexico as a whole grew 11.5% in the same period. Monster’s market share in Mexico in May 2010 increased by 0.4 points to 25.2%, which excludes Java Monster. We are working with our distributor to address specific channels, which lower-priced competitor products such as Gladiator has gained share. Sales continued to progress satisfactorily in the United Kingdom and continental Europe. Equally sales in Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia continued to perform very satisfactorily. In the second quarter of 2010, net sales in Europe in U.S. dollars were more 230% higher than in the comparable quarter in 2009. However, sponsorship expenses, sampling costs, and point of sale costs as well as payroll costs continued to be high particularly as we ramp up in new countries in which we are launching Monster. During the second quarter we launched the Monster Energy brand in Slovakia, Czech Republic and Norway. We are currently in the process of launching the brand in Germany, the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon and Jordan with additional introductions anticipated for later in 2010. While sales of Monster Energy commenced in Brazil in the first quarter, we experienced delays in clearing certain ingredients through customs which resulted in a disruption in our supply chain. We have now recommenced production in Brazil and I am hopeful that we have put the disruptions in supply behind us. Competition continues to be aggressively in Australia. We believe that our distribution partner is not effectively executing at the point of sale or following the sales strategy that we have found it works well for ourselves. We are working with them to implement our suggested programs. We have launched X-Presso Monster in Australia, which will provide us with the unique product unlike any other energy drinks in that market. Gross sales were up in each of the three months of this quarter as compared to last year. Sales in July are also ahead of sales in July last year. Monster Energy drinks achieved record sales during the second quarter of 2010 and June sales were the highest ever achieved by the Monster Energy brand despite lower sales of Monster Energy Hitman shots during the quarter. Sales of our new peach tea brand continued to gain strength and grew approximately $7 million in the second quarter of 2010. We are pleased with the results that we achieved to-date with peach tea. As previously mentioned in our last conference call, sales in the first quarter were negatively impacted by (inaudible) purchases made by customers in 2009 fourth quarter. While such negative impact did not affect the second quarter results, it affected the results for the six months ended June 30, 2010. We have reviewed our strategy to compete in the energy shot category and are planning to launch a new energy structure in the third quarter or shortly thereafter under the Works brand name. For the three months ended June 30, 2010, gross sales to retail grocery, specialty chains, and wholesalers represented 5% of gross sales, down from 7% last year. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains, and mass merchandisers represent 13% of sales, up from 12% last year. Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 64% of sales, down from 67% in the same period last year. Other sales were 2% as compared to 3% last year. Gross sales outside the United States increased to 16% from 11% in the same period last year. Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the second quarter of 2010 amounted to $66.6 million compared to $39.4 million in the same quarter last year. Included in such sales are sales to the company’s military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and then trans-shipped to the military and their customers overseas. Gross profit margins in the second quarter of 2010 were 52.9% versus 53.9% in the comparable quarter last year and 52.3% in the first quarter of 2010. The reduction in our overall gross margin was partly due to the higher percentage of our sales attributable to sales in Europe and Australia where gross margins are lower than in North America and lower margins achieved by us for our peach tea brand. MDF and CMAs as a percentage of net sales were slightly lower than in the same period last year. Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales were slightly higher than the same period last year. Sponsorship and endorsement costs incurred by us were approximately $3.3 million higher than in the comparable period last year. While point of sale costs were approximately $2.6 million higher, such increase was largely offset by a reduction in merchandisers display costs of approximately $2 million. Although selling expenses were higher than in the same period last year, selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were lower in the second quarter of 2010 than in the comparable period in 2009. Payroll expenses in the same quarter of 2010 were higher than in 2009. It represented a similar percentage of net sales as in 2009. General and administrative expenses were higher in the second quarter of 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in professional service fees and an increase in bad debts. Operating income for the second quarter included losses of $4.2 million incurred in relation to our European and Australian operations. As a percentage of net sales, operating losses in the United Kingdom and Europe were substantially lower than in the first quarter of 2010. The effective tax rate for 2010 second quarter was 42% compared with 38.5% in the same quarter last year. The increased tax rate was primarily the result of a non-cash charge to establish a full valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset related to a foreign subsidiary and its related impact on the company’s overall tax rate. We continue to make progress in the implementation of the SAP enterprise resource planning system, which was introduced on January 1, 2010. While we believe that delays in filling deliveries and lost sales have significantly reduced since the first quarter, we are unable to quantify what the impact has been, either we continue to believe that the impact was relatively minor and that the change to the SAP will ultimately be beneficial for the company overall. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $409.9 million compared to $328.3 million at December 31, 2009. Short-term investments were $61.7 million as compared to $18.5 million at December 31, 2009. Long-term investments decreased from $80.8 million at December 31, 2009 to $59.5 million. Included in short-term and long-term investments are auction rate securities of $76.2 million. Trade accounts receivables net increased to $127.6 million from $104.2 million at December 31, 2009. Distribution agreement receivables decreased to $3.9 million from $4.7 million at December 31, 2009. Days outstanding for receivables were 31.4 days at December 31, 2009, compared to 30 days at June 30, 2010. Inventories increased to $139.2 million from $108.1 million at December 31, 2009. Average days of inventory was 73 days at June 30, 2010, which is higher than the 72 days of inventory at December 31, 2009. In March 2010, the company entered into an agreement relating to $54.2 million in par value auction rate securities which enables the company to sell such securities, Put Option, in semiannual or annual installments beginning March 22, 2011, with full sale rights available on or after March 22, 2013. Such auction rate securities which have been reclassified from available for sale to trading securities will continue to accrue interest until redeemed through the Put Option or as determined by the auction process or by the terms outlined in their respective prospectuses in the event of auction failure. At June 30, 2010 the Company held auction rate securities with a face value of $87.3 million, $92.7 million at March 31, 2010 and the Put Option with a fair market value of $4.1 million, which was $5.1 million at March 31, 2010. The Company determined that an impairment related to its auction rate securities of $6.5 million existed at June 30, 2010, of which $2.4 million was deemed temporary and $4.1 million was deemed other-than- temporary. As a result, a loss of $1.4 million, net of taxes is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss as of June 30, 2010, and we recorded a net charge to earnings of $0.7 million in respect of our auction rate securities for the second quarter of 2010. The auction rate securities will continue to accrue interest at their contractual rates until their respective auctions succeed or they are redeemed. In the second quarter, we launched Monster Import Light in a 550 ml resealable can as well as Monster Energy and low-cost (ph) Monster Energy in 12 ounce slim cans for our an in-and-out summer promotion. In the third quarter of 2010, we launched our new Monster Energy Absolutely Zero, which is a zero calorie energy drink in 16 ounce cans. We have also introduced Monster Energy Dub Edition in 550 ml resealable cans. We are planning to introduce both an unsweetened and diet green tea in the peach tea line in the second quarter of this year as well as a new zero calorie nitrous Monster Energy drink extension. We are also in the process of converting our X-Presso Monster coffee energy drinks into a larger size 12 ounce slim can and intend to introduce a second variant to that line, so that it will be a total of two variants in the X-Presso Monster line in the future. We anticipate that these products will be introduced before the end of 2010. As indicated earlier, we are also planning to launch a new energy shot under the brand Works during the second half of 2010. I would like to open the floor to questions, thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Just in terms of the recent improvement both the category trends as well as your sales trend, maybe give us a little bit more perspective on what you think is driving that improvement? Certainly the comps are going to get a little bit tougher as you get back into the latter part of the year, do you think the acceleration is sustainable? And then, if you have any color in terms of whether the improvement continued into the July months.
Rodney Sacks: As you know Judy, we really don’t give direction or forecast because recently, it will be speculative, all you can see is looking back as to where we are, month by month, we all have seen continued improvements pretty much this year. As you know, last year the category slowed, there were a couple of months, a few months were negative towards the middle of the year or just as we started the second half and then it picked up, but a very, very low single digit. But what we have seen is continued improvement. So we believe very that what’s happening is, we think that convenience store traffic appears to be picking up, we seem to be getting better results from our 24-ounce which was a package which did suffer most when we started to have the downturn in the economy. So that’s what we sort of see. So while we are hopeful for the continued numbers improvement, we obviously don’t know, but I mean I did cite the most recent Nielsen numbers, which continued to show that increase and we did indicate earlier that our sales in July without going into detail were in fact up and so we are quite pleased with what we are seeing in July. We are also pleased obviously with what’s going on and we believe in Europe at the moment and the brand is starting to find its feet there.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: And just in terms of a competitive environment, you pulled out in the last call that Red Bull had gotten a little bit more competitive. It seemed like that their sales kind of also accelerated and then the latest month, it seemed like you were actually showing better sales trends. So maybe talk a little bit about what’s been happening in terms of the competitive dynamics what Red Bull has been trying to do –
Rodney Sacks: What’s happened to Red Bull is they have become pretty competitive, they have also been quite aggressive in some of the price promotions but what’s happened is they have also increased to look at their sales mix, they are selling more in their 12 ounce and now they are 16 ounce size. When you look the pricing, they do have a higher pricing structure than we do and their 12 ounces is at $2.99 and their 16 ounce is close to $3.99. So I think that if you look at in units, I don’t think they have the same increase. I think we have continued to increase both in units and sales and dollars where if they have already increased in dollars because what’s happened is they are just selling slightly more of the higher priced units. So we believe that that’s really driving a lot of the growth over those three different sizes and they are going to start trading off harder comps (ph) because they were introduced last year during the course of the year. So that’s where we think they are getting a lift in that area.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: And then just in terms of your operating expenses, obviously you have seen significant increases as a result of the European expansion. Are you at a point where in terms of the infrastructure, it’s sizeable enough that can support continued launches into other markets or you are continuing to see operating expenses kind of grow in line with sales growth going forward?
Rodney Sacks: Obviously in the many places, what we are going to do is we start off disproportionately because as you launch in a country even though you have got very low to no sale or very limited sales for the first period of time, you do have to establish an infrastructure in each country or basic country managers, softening, marketing person, and softening teams. So that starts to become very top-heavy at the beginning and then it starts to rectify itself quite reasonably quickly. In the basic infrastructure for Europe, we have established our operations in the UK and those are getting to a point where they will start now and we will start to see efficiencies as we continue to increase in sales. So we are going to see efficiencies in the staffing and bottom line from Europe from the basic operations we have there but obviously that will be a little bit negatively affected by the manpower as we go into new countries, country by country. But overall, our sale volume now is such that we are starting to see the benefits, we are starting to see lower cost per case, and that is continuing to improve and we believe that next year even though we are still planning quite an aggressive expansion program that we still will continue to see better results coming into Europe. They key for us is the ability to achieve the sales and sustain the sales and that’s been important that we can manage our costs lighter, the key is to get the sales first.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line if Kaumil Gajrawala with UBS.
Kaumil Gajrawala – UBS: A couple quick ones. The first thing is, is the tax rate one time? Should it go back to a normalized tax rate or is this 42 something that should –?
Rodney Sacks: It should go back to a normalized tax rate. It may be a little bit high for a period of time as we continued to still have some losses coming through from Europe but as soon as that sort of starts filtering through, it will go down. Again, but it will only be, I think, at most marginally higher than on an ongoing basis whereas we took the adjustment this quarter.
Kaumil Gajrawala – UBS: Okay, I see. And then over time as Europe becomes a larger piece of your business would the tax rate naturally from the mix effect also come down?
Rodney Sacks: That will also come down, but they will also then have the benefit of picking up the losses that we do we are incurring at the current time. So we’ve written back the fate of that. But when ultimately you start earning profits for a period of time, you will actually benefit from that and then it will normalize going forward after that.
Kaumil Gajrawala – UBS: Got it. And then I think if I heard right you mentioned cost of the put option was $4.1 million, is that correct?
Rodney Sacks: I think that is correct. And that’s just a particularly an accounting noncash item.
Kaumil Gajrawala – UBS: But it’s also one-time, that’s not something that will repeat now that you’ve paid for that put option.
Rodney Sacks: We never paid for it. It’s simply a way that we were required to –
Hilton Schlosberg: It’s a evaluation of the production by an independent firm that does such evaluation.
Kaumil Gajrawala – UBS: Okay. Got it, but it hits the SG&A line at least this quarter, correct?
Rodney Sacks: It gets treated through the income statement from an accounting point of view, but it’s completely noncash, it just – and that’s the same reason we had that $0.7 million adjustment as well. It’s just an evaluation, but it’s – there will be no change in the underlying – in the underlying auction rate securities or the creditors or anything, but it’s just again these are evaluation changes that keep affecting the income statement.
Kaumil Gajrawala – UBS: That means we should adjust it out if we are looking for the underlying number, correct?
Hilton Schlosberg: Well, that is fair. If you look on the income statement, it is loss on investments and put option next.
Rodney Sacks: But your point is correct, that if you’re trying to get to a normalized trading, this should be taken out.
Kaumil Gajrawala – UBS: Okay, got it.
Rodney Sacks: We don’t believe we’re actually going to end up with any cost or loss on these auction rate securities ultimately.
Kaumil Gajrawala – UBS: Okay perfect. And then the second – the final thing, if I could just ask for classification – or clarification, you mentioned that July was up. Does that mean year-over-year, did that mean sequentially, was that growth rate, absolute number?
Rodney Sacks: It’s – we generated both year-on-year and that was up satisfactorily.
Kaumil Gajrawala – UBS: Okay, got it, thank you.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with SLSA. Please go ahead.
Caroline Levy – SLSA: Good morning, everybody.
Rodney Sacks: Good morning, Caroline.
Caroline Levy – SLSA: Good morning, everybody. I guess it is afternoon even there. I just wanted ask more strategic questions. First, why you think c-store traffic is improving or c-store sales are improving even though unemployment does not seem to be improving?
Rodney Sacks: Well, it’s just a question of anecdotally that’s the sort of information we’ve getting back from the field. We have started seeing trends back in 24-hour site sales which was really primarily solid in that channel has started picking up. And when we saw the downturn in the economy that’s when the first package that dropped off for us. And so that should – our conclusion from talking to people, people in the field and retailers.
Caroline Levy – SLSA: Yes, just very interesting, because – I guess, I think Coke had said maybe that they felt that some c-stores were offering value packages, but you’re just seeing base package go up again which is a very good sign.
Rodney Sacks: Yes.
Caroline Levy – SLSA: Yes, and then, I would also ask why are you – and I think I’ve asked you this before, but why would you be tackling so many different countries at once and don’t you think there’s risk to do that?
Rodney Sacks: We’re tackling what we think is appropriate. Number one, we’re – basically we were incurring a lot of costs in getting into Europe. And so, a lot of our marketing spend is really a Pan European spend. So we feel it is the right way to go to basically fill out Europe. You have a lot of your overhead and management costs that really in place, that can basically handle and run and go out to the address you have. Secondly, by delaying things, all you do is you let your competitors have more time to establish their brands whether they’re local competitors or low-priced brands. And, we’re there – we’re present in Europe, you might as well as deal with it, the country. So we’re not dealing with it all at one time, we’re dealing with it gradually. We’ve done – as we’ve indicated, there are three countries in the second quarter. We’re doing more countries now, we’re doing more countries in fourth quarter, and it’s going to continue to run along that basis. We’re going to aggressive – we have two very, very sort of – we have two different basic operations and divisions at under two management heads in Europe, one for Western Europe who handles his expansion, which is Middle East and Europe, and then the – we have a new Head of Central and Eastern Europe, who has joined us, and he really is taking care of those markets. Really, you can’t run them in parallel, because they’re really operating with different teams.
Caroline Levy – SLSA: I see. Okay, that’s helpful. And then the future of tea, do you think it’s – do you see this as a small adjunct or do you think what you are seeing is, that this really could be a meaningful business overtime?
Rodney Sacks: Sorry.
Caroline Levy – SLSA: Tea, I’m looking at tea, and wondering if you this as sort of a tiny and little add-on that is a long from being significant or if there is anything?
Rodney Sacks: It’s an add-on. We’ll call it a little add-on. Everything starts small. And you start brands and you – you start with the brand and then you see what – how the brand develops and you’ve got to be fortunate that you get a brand that gets – that starts picking, that gets resonates well with consumers and many times. And the success of the brand is really a function of that. In the case of a CC brand, it is small, but at the same time, we are seeing it resonating well. We are seeing good repeat sales, we’re getting pretty exciting responses back from the trade. And so we do believe that the brand, number one, has legs as it, but obviously our goal there is to extend the brand into additional packages that will help in the margins and to continue to grow the brand and you got to plan for the future. We’re continuing to obviously focus on our main products which is more uncertain to grow. But we’re also continuing to run the business and plan for three years and five years down the line as to what will be and what will be the makeup of our sales mix. And we – it takes time to develop, that don’t just – particularly the size of company like ours are not going to make an impact for the number of years until it grows to a significant size that that we’ve got to continue to develop and put the effort behind our alternative brands and obviously the best of our product offerings. We just think tea is a nice category, it’s got growth. We think that there was a limited amount of competition and we saw an opportunity and we do believe that in the long term that could be significant brand for us. It may be less significant from my profit point of view. But certainly from an asset and value point of view on the top line, we think it can create a lot of value and for the company.
Caroline Levy – SLSA: That’s really helpful. I just have two other ones. One is, is there any chance you would give EBIT by division or do we have to wait for 10-Q?
Rodney Sacks: I think you should wait on the 10-Q on that.
Caroline Levy – SLSA: If I hadn’t added that, would you might maybe have given it to me?
Rodney Sacks: No.
Caroline Levy – SLSA: And then, finally, if you just look at California, which was your original market, do you have any – I’m sure you do follow this closely – how were – how was your sales growth there compared to general sales growth across the US?
Rodney Sacks: In fact, California did pretty well for us. In the – I’ll just find it for you quickly. I think we are up in – we were up pretty nicely in California, particularly Southern California. If I look at the – it’d be pretty mature in California, because we have a pretty high share in the convenience channel. We were up 13.6% in Los Angeles market. We have a 38.7% share. So California is actually doing very well for us. They were sometimes last year when we had a big shipment that was sort of a slight falloff in our market share, but it has picked up again.
Caroline Levy – SLSA: That’s excellent. Thank you so much. I appreciate it.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.
Mark Astrachan – Stifel Nicolaus: Hi, good afternoon, guys, and congrats on the nice quarter.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you.
Mark Astrachan – Stifel Nicolaus: I guess just a question first on your overall thoughts on current distribution footprints. Curious, how you assess whether you think you’re optimizing what you’ve got in both the US and in Europe, and I guess just in particular – yes, it sort of seems like things are doing better in Western Europe in the CC markets, but it still seems like there, there might be a bit more opportunity to educate their sales force to more effectively sell your products. I’m curious if you think that’s true. And then in the US, if you could just give us a sense of how you’re –?
Rodney Sacks: I think both markets are in a similar position, but at a different stages of development. In the UK, for example, our distribution levels are so – we’ve got a substantial way to go. I think that looking at one of the reports which indicated that our distribution levels were under 50% for our top SKU and then the two are lower in the CC system. Now, if you look at Relentless, which is the other Coke energy drink their system, their distribution level it’s about 80 for their SKU. So we believe we are continuing to improve and grow and we all – we have upside growth to improve our distribution levels there, but I think it applies across the whole board in Europe. If I look at our sales per point against Relentless, we are at or equal to or exceeding them already. But as a brand, we’re actually still behind them, because of our – we’ve got to catch up to do on the distribution levels. So we do have – we believe room to grow. And as we continue to become more well established in Europe, we think sales performance and our sales rate will also improve. In the US, it’s obviously, we’re more mature. But, again, even in the US, we still have the same issue. We can always improve and we can always still find additional distribution. When you take our top selling SKU in convenience, yes, we’ve got 95% distribution. But when you go down to the 24 ounce and we have 65% distribution. And so you drop-off – you drop-off from there and about 88% for the diet, the low carb, but then after that when you go to our new product Import is 52%, Khaos is 72%, Java Monster is in the 60%, 63%, 65%. So the two top Java Monster line. So there is still room to improve the quality and depth of our distribution of all products and that’s obviously what we continue to work on. And I think we’re improving, but getting better distribution. But we just got that opportunity to continue to keep in our sights as we go forward.
 Mark Astrachan – Stifel Nicolaus: And what about on premise in the US?
Rodney Sacks: On premise, we’re sort of looking at some of our strategy. It’s still a very small proportion of our business. We are doing some nice business in some key accounts like Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas and in some other key accounts, but it’s still a very small proportion and we still have a lot of upside potential. We’re looking at making some changes in how do we go to market there, what distribution partners might be better suited in certain states and we are looking at making some changes in that area as we go forward.
Mark Astrachan – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, great. And then just two housekeeping questions. One, did you buyback any more stock versus what you indicated at the shareholder meeting?
Rodney Sacks: No, not since then.
Mark Astrachan – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. And the second is on the G&A side in terms of the professional service fees. Anything in the numbers this quarter like legal settlements, anything like that that wouldn’t be recurring?
Rodney Sacks: The costs in that area were much higher this quarter than obviously last year. We saw quite a bit of increase and that was due just through some quite a bit of legal actions or some of them have been resolved already, some are sort of ongoing. But they will get resolved reasonably soon. And so they shouldn’t be ongoing at that level. We also incurred professional fees for SAP, license fees, consulting fees just to get to button down that implementation of that system, which also will not be ongoing. We also had – what we did do also was we terminated a distributor who was distributing in a portion of Mexico for us. We ascertained that the particular distributor was, in fact, trying shipping some of their product that they were buying back into the United States, it was sort of disrupting some of our markets and we ended up terminating that distributor. So we did incur some legal costs in connection with professional fees of investigators plus legal costs and also we have made the provision for a bad debt against the net balance owed by that distributor as to whether we will be effective in the recovery. We have a legal right to recover, but as to whether we will be able to effectively – recover is another issue, we have taken steps to a point of terminating that distributor’s agreement. We appointed the distributor that handles the rest of Mexico for us which is Humex, to cover that territory in the Baja and Sanora areas. So that also made up quite a bit of the additional cost that we incurred in this quarter, in the G&A area.
Mark Astrachan – Stifel Nicolaus: So ballpark what about should we be back out as potentially or not recurring?
Rodney Sacks: I don’t know those – those sort of items are probably between roughly $2 million to $3 million.
Mark Astrachan – Stifel Nicolaus: Perfect, thank you.
Rodney Sacks: But that’s a pretty guesstimate figure. Thanks.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Alec Patterson with RCM. Please go ahead.
Alec Patterson – RCM: Hi, Rodney, how are you?
Rodney Sacks: Fine, good, thanks. And you Alec?
Alec Patterson – RCM: Fine, thanks. I was just curious, Rodney, the data you give about the category trends in the US and you go through the various major players. In years past there used to be a lot of other players, a lot of one-offs, in and out, that sort of thing. And now that the marketplace is consolidating to 70% in the hands of the top three players, I was just wondering what are you seeing in the all other segment? Is there much activity there?
Rodney Sacks: There really isn’t – there are still dozens of off the wall brands that get launched and try and come into the market. But the market is clearly settling down and stratifying. It’s becoming more mature, it’s becoming clear that there is a really big gap. You really have a very good – you have Red Bull at the top. You really have a very big gap even between Rockstar which is pretty much a third of our size in the market. And the interesting thing is that the brand from Coke and Pepsi, they’ve got a whole spiel of five or six brands, but they are not being able to hold their own for those brands even they’ve got – they’re over spaced, they – because they have ability to execute and negotiate or secure the substantial self space which it’s making it more difficult for even some of the independents to get shelf space because these guys are over spaced and they’re not doing the sales. So you already got quite a big group of brands that really don’t deserve the space they’re getting and you’re really blocking up the space. So we even see some of those brands finally going away and we probably end up with a more normalized market, which is be limited to three or four brands.
Alec Patterson – RCM: Okay. How nice. And also, I was wondering do you have any market share data for the UK and France?
Rodney Sacks: I don’t have. I’ve talked with our guys, but I just don’t have anything. I think that’s concrete enough that I’m uncomfortable [ph] enough to talk about at this time.
Alec Patterson – RCM: Okay, and fair enough. And then on the Brazilian situation, not clear. Did you imply that you had shipped in the first quarter, had issues in the second quarter, restarted in the third?
Rodney Sacks: Correct. We had to pull back some of our distribution efforts that didn’t into certain channels, because we just didn’t have enough finished product. And then we started our production now in July and we’re doing it – we’re producing now in August and we believe we’ll have enough to start going forward. We’re pretty much sort of almost relaunch it in a much extensive scale.
Alec Patterson – RCM: Okay. And then lastly, Rodney, just curious as you have expanded all of these markets, and the new entry markets, et cetera, your manufacturing footprint, has it spread out as well or is that on the comp to sort of match your new markets?
Rodney Sacks: We’ve generally had one source of manufacturer in Europe which has always as we’ve expanded into Europe, it has resulted in us incurring quite a lot of freight costs that have been pretty expensive. We are just starting up a second point of manufacturer in the UK with CCE and we believe we will be – it is our intention to start up at least another manufacturer somewhere towards Central or Southern Europe. So we should have – by summer, we are hoping to have at least three manufacturing plants up and running in Europe, which will help at least make us more efficient on the freight and transportation side for Europe.
Alec Patterson – RCM: Okay, thanks very much, Rodney.
Hilton Schlosberg: We manufacture in Australia and we also manufacture in Brazil.
Rodney Sacks: Yes.
Alec Patterson – RCM: Okay, thank you.
Hilton Schlosberg: In Canada.
Rodney Sacks: And in Canada as well. So, again, and as we expand the company to South America, we will see if we can source it from the Brazilian once the single source there.
Alec Patterson – RCM: Great.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Sacks, for closing remarks.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you very much. We’ve been pretty excited about the fact that we are seeing these positive trends returning to the market. We also as you may have heard we recently appointed a Senior VP of Sales to head up our North American operations, Emily Terry [ph], who was a Business Unit Manager and VP at Anheuser-Busch. And so we’re quite hopeful that we’ll get a lot of focus. She is a very detailed person and we believe that she’s going to be very valuable to the company as we continue to meet the challenges of continuing to grow from our position of strength in the energy market. But we’re hopeful that we’ll have a good second half of the year, and we’re very excited, and thank you for your support. Thanks very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Hansen Natural Corporation second quarter 2010 financial results conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2010 Q1  (2010-05-06 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Rodney Sacks – Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
Analysts: Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs Mark Astrachan – Stifel Nicolaus Michael [Avery] – CLSA John Faucher – JP Morgan

Although the beverage market in general continued to show softness through the first quarter of 2010, particularly in North America, the energy drink category inclusive of energy shots continued to experience increases in sales. According to Nielsen for the 13 weeks through April 24, 2010, all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, and mass merchandisers, excluding Wal-Mart, sales in the energy drink category including shots increased 7.5% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 8.8% in the 13-week period concerned while sales of Red Bull increased by 13.3%. Sales of Rockstar increased 3.1%, sales of Amp dropped 9.5%, sales of NOS increased 8.5%, and sales of Full Throttle dropped 21.1%. According to the Nielsen report for the four weeks ending April 24, 2010, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel increased by 5.6% over the comparable four-week period in 2009.  Over this period, sales of Monster increased by 7.1% over last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 11.7% over last year. Rockstar was up 1.8%, while Amp was down 13.4%. Full Throttle was down 28.8%. No Fear was down 39.2%, while SoBe and Adrenaline Rush were down in excess of [90%]. NOS was up by 1.8%.  According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended April 24, 2010, Monster's market share of the convenience and gas channel of the energy drink category including energy shots was 27.7% against Red Bull's share of 31.8% and Rockstar's share of 9.6%. In actual dollars, sales in the energy drink category for all outlets combined increased by $91.6 million to $1.3 billion in the 13 weeks ended April 24, 2010.  According to Nielsen, sales of Monster increased by $27.6 million as compared to sales of Red Bull which increased by $50.1 million. Sales of Rockstar increased by $3.9 million and, sales of Amp decreased by $8.2 million. Sales of NOS increased by $3.5 million, while sales of Full Throttle dropped by $10.4 million. We continue to address the markets in the United States in which Monster has experienced weakness with a view to recovering market share.  According to Nielsen, sales of Java Monster represented approximately 12.3% of the sales of the Monster brand for the 13 weeks to April 24, 2010, which is a decrease of 1.2 percentage points as compared to 13.5% for the same period last year. The decline in the sales of Java Monster continues to be attributable primarily to the entry of Starbucks into the category in the middle of the second quarter of 2008 with its new line of Doubleshot Energy Plus coffee drinks in 15-ounce cans which compete directly with Java Monster.  We are, however, seeing increased sales of Loca Moca and Mean Bean, which are the primary packages of our Java Monster line over the comparable 13-week period last year. In the 13 weeks ended April 24, 2010, for all outlets combined, sales of the ready-to-drink coffee drinks and energy plus coffee drinks increased 2.1% over the same period last year. Java Monster is 0.6% lower than last year. Starbucks Doubleshot Energy is up 24.1. Rockstar Roasted is down 17.8%, and Full Throttle coffee is down 52.9%. We continue to see improvements in Monster's market share and sales in Canada. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended April 10, 2010, the energy drink category grew 8%. Monster's market share increased 5.2 points over the same period last year to 18.8%, while Red Bull's share increased 1 point to 37.8 and Rockstar's market share decreased by 0.6 points to 13.6%. According to Nielsen, sales of Monster Energy in Mexico in February 2010 grew 23.6% over last year while sales of Red Bull grew 16.7%. Sales in the energy drink category in Mexico grew 24.9% in the same period. Monster's market share in Mexico in February 2010 decreased by 0.3 points to 24.9%, which excludes Java Monster. In the Mexico City region, Monster experienced some softness in the lower-priced traditional channel due to lower-priced competitor products in that channel such as Gladiator. We are addressing this channel with our distributors in Mexico. Sales continued to progress satisfactorily in the United Kingdom and continental Europe. Although sales in Europe were lower in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period last year, 2009 first quarter sales included initial sales to Coca-Cola Enterprises and its customers. Consequently, excluding the initial sales in the first quarter of 2009, sales levels in Europe are higher this year than they were in the same period last year.  We believe that the brand is gaining momentum in Europe; and in light of April sales and May orders in Europe, we expect sales in the second quarter in Europe to be materially higher than last year. However, costs in Europe, particularly sponsorship expenses, sampling costs, and point of sale costs, were higher than anticipated. We believe that over the full 2010 year, our selling costs per case as well as our manufacturing cost per case in Europe will be lower than they were in the first quarter.  We commenced sales in Norway during the first quarter and anticipate commencing sales in Germany shortly. We also commenced sales in Hungary in April and in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in May through Coca-Cola Helenic. We also commenced sales of Monster Energy in Brazil in the first quarter and are planning to commence sales in additional countries in central and Eastern Europe and South America during the remainder of 2010. Competition has been very aggressive in Australia, but we are encouraged with the progress that we continue to make there.  Both our gross and net sales were negatively impacted by advance purchases made by customers in the 2009 fourth quarter due to our announcement of a new per case marketing contribution program for Monster Energy distributors commencing January 1, 2010, as well as to avoid potential interruptions in product supply due to our announcement to transition to the SAP enterprise resource planning system commencing January 2010.  If the estimated sales attributable to the fourth quarter volume had been included in the 2010 first quarter, and which the company previously estimated at approximately 4% to 6% of 2009 fourth quarter sales, we estimate that sales of the Monster Energy brand, excluding shots, would have been approximately 5% to 8% higher than in the comparable 2009 quarter.  Sales of shots in the first quarter were substantially lower than last year; although according to Nielsen, sales of Monster Energy shots to retail customers were actual higher in the 13-week period ended April 24, 2010, than in the comparable period last year. We are reviewing our strategy to compete in the energy shot category, including continuing to sell our Monster Hitman energy shots.  Gross sales were down in the first two months of this year compared to last year. March sales were more than 10% higher than last year's sales, and our preliminary sales for April are also similarly higher than last year. For the three months ended March 31, 2010, sales to retail grocery, specialty chains, and wholesalers represented 7% of gross sales, up from 6% last year. Sales to club stores, drug chains, and mass merchandisers represent 12% of sales, down from 15% last year. Sales to full-service distributors represented 64% of sales, up from 63% in the same period last year. Other sales were 3%, which is the same as last year; and sales outside the United States increased to 14% from 13% in the same period last year.  Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the first quarter of 2010 amounted to $37.8 million compared to $35.3 million in the same quarter last year. Included in such sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and then trans-shipped to the military and their customers overseas. Sales to military customers were lower than last year, primarily due to the relocation of a large number of United States troops and logistics difficulties that were experienced in our ability to supply product to them. Gross profit margins were 52.3% this year versus 53.3% last year. The reduction in our overall gross margin generally was partly attributable to lower margins achieved by us for our [inaudible]. Our overall gross margin was also negatively affected by lower gross margins achieved in Europe and Australia than in the comparable period last year. MDF and CMAs were higher in 2010 than in the comparable period last year. Sponsorship and endorsement costs incurred by us were approximately $3.7 million higher than in the comparable period last year. Payroll expenses were also substantially higher in the first quarter of 2010. The principal reason for the increase in payroll costs was attributable to a noncash stock-based compensation charge of $5 million in the first quarter of 2010 as compared to $2.7 million in the first quarter of 2009.  Operating income in the first quarter includes losses of $3.9 million incurred in relation to our European and Australian operations. Our peach tea line of ready-to-drink iced teas has been well received by consumers and is continuing to gain traction. Repeat sales continue to increase. Sales of peach tea were approximately $5 million in the first quarter of 2010. As can be expected with any significant changeover of an IT system, we did experience some issues and challenges when we completed our North American transition to the SAP enterprise resource planning system as of January 1, 2010. There have been some delays in filling deliveries and some lost sales as a result, but we have been working through these issues.  I can't quantify what the impact has been, but we believe the impact was relatively minor and that the change to the SAP system will ultimately be beneficial for the company overall. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $375.9 million compared to $328.3 million at December 31, 2009. Short-term investments were $61.3 million, compared to $18.5 million at December 31, 2009. Long-term investments consisting of auction rate securities decreased from $80.8 million to $64.4 million.  Trade accounts receivables net increased to $113.9 million from $104.2 million at December 31, 2009. Distribution agreement receivables decreased to $3.8 million from $4.7 million at December 31, 2009. Days outstanding for receivables were 31.4 days at December 31, 2009, compared to 31 days at March 31, 2010.  Inventories increased to $119.1 million from $108.1 million at December 31, 2009. Average days of inventory was 94 days at March 31, 2010, which is higher than the 72 days of inventory at December 31, 2009.  In March 2010, the company entered into an agreement relating to $54.2 million in par value auction rated securities which enables the company to sell such securities put option in semiannual or annual installments beginning March 22, 2011, with full [inaudible] available on or off to March 22, 2013. Such auction rate securities which have been reclassified from available for sale to trading securities will continue to accrue interest until redeemed through the put option or as determined by the auction process or by the terms outlined in their respective prospectuses in the event of auction failure.  The fair market value of the put option of $5.1 million offset by a $4.9 million loss on trading securities has been recognized in the income statement for the first quarter of 2010. The company also recognized a gain of $0.4 million resulting from the redemption at par of a separate security which previously had been other than temporarily impaired. At March 31, 2010, the company held auction rate securities with a face value of $92.7 million – $96.4 million at December 31, 2009. The company determined that an impairment of $7 million existed at March 31, 2010, of which $3 million was deemed temporary and $4 million was deemed other than temporary. As a result, included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss is $1.8 million net of taxes as of March 31, 2010. Auction rate securities will continue to accrue interest at their contractual rates until their respective auctions succeed or they are redeemed.  I would like to open the floor to questions. Thank you.

 :
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Thanks. I guess I am trying to understand the underlying sales growth in the quarter for the U.S. market, because I know you have the volume that distorted the figures. So do you have that figure just in terms of what the U.S. sales would have been ex the inventory volume?
Rodney Sacks: Sorry. Judy, just one thing I would like the clarify that the 5.28% increase in sales of the Monster Energy brand, including shots that I referred to earlier, as giving affect to the fourth quarter volume estimates were in gross sales figures.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: But that includes the international numbers. Does that include the international numbers, right?
Rodney Sacks: That includes international, correct.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: I guess I am just trying to understand. Because the U.S. numbers that would have been down slightly?
Rodney Sacks: If you go back to the U.S. numbers, the U.S. numbers, after giving affect to the estimate of buy-in volume, are in fact up.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Okay. Does that reconcile with the Nielsen numbers that you cited in the [inaudible]?
Rodney Sacks: Probably a little bit lower than the Nielsen numbers. The Nielsen numbers were citing or indicating higher sales, slightly higher.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Then just in terms of the category trends, we've heard from a lot of the other beverage companies that actually industry that may be outside of energy drink categories trends improved in late March and then into April. It looks like, based on the Nielsen numbers that you cited, the energy drink category actually decelerated from the first quarter and into April. So, I am just wondering what you think is driving that phenomenon?
Rodney Sacks: I think that basically looking at a single month really isn't very reliable. We did see generally a pickup coming from November last year through the first quarter. We then saw a dropoff in January, and then it picked up in February, and then it picked up again in March and had a slight dropoff. So it's really going up and down.  I think the positive news is that the category is trending positive – far better numbers in the higher single digits than it was in the first quarter or the first half plus of last year. We are still seeing positive trends in the category.  When you contrast that with the general [inaudible] C&D category which, as you can see from all the major companies that have reported recently, all volumes pretty much in the North America are down.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Just in terms of the competitive situation. I think this is probably the first quarter where Red Bull has outpaced Monster in a while. So, what is driving the improvement in Red Bull and what are you trying to do [inaudible] at a competitive level?
Rodney Sacks: I think what has been happening is Red Bull has been introducing their 16-ounce drinks that have been getting increased distribution of the 16-ounce size products. That has enabled them to get additional traction in space. What's happening is they've obviously been able to trade up sales in dollar terms because of the higher price ring of the 16-ounce. They also have been increasing in volume, and they've been, not everywhere, there's been some aggressive pricing from Red Bull. Probably a little more than we've seen historically. But on average, the brand has just got some traction.  If you look at the sales numbers in the category, you pretty much, it's Red Bull and ourselves that are still selling. They have increased sales in the last couple of months a little higher than us. We are looking at that. We're looking at our own marketing in our programs, and we are going to address that going forward into the second quarter.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Sounds like you may have to spend more to get some of that share back from Red Bull?
Rodney Sacks: I'm not sure we need to spend more, but perhaps spend differently and in a different way. We sort of had probably not done a lot of promotions in the first couple of months of this year and then started to increase later. We were a little bit cautious when we were going into this whole changeover into the SAP system as well.  We have a number of very, we think, unique promotions going into summer, including a promotion in summer with Slash, the musician, which we think will be very popular and will offer well for sales going forward. We are addressing it, and we are looking at addressing the market and how to obviously meet competition.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Mark Astrachan – Stifel Nicolaus.
Mark Astrachan – Stifel Nicolaus: Good morning or good afternoon, guys. Just questions on the G&A expenses. Curious what would be in there that might not necessarily be realized from reading the press release like the payoff for Nick, your COO in the Monster business leaving, the legal fees in there, that sort of thing. If you could just break that out a bit more, I think that would be helpful.
Rodney Sacks: I don't think we'd like to break it out in much more detail. Travel was one item that we noted for the company was considerably higher. As I think we had indicated, the costs of coolers, sorry, the cost of depreciation. We've been putting a lot more coolers into the trade. There is a depreciation plus a cost expense that was expensed for the SAP system.  The costs related to Nick leaving were not significant. I think the major costs were attributable to, as I said, to the items that we previously indicated which is the additional sponsorships and costs of those items. We felt certain sponsorships were desirable for us to secure. Some of them were secured back in last year. We just think that was necessary for the brand to keep the brand's positioning. In the extreme action sports both in the U.S. and in Europe and in many cases, unfortunately, you have to spend ahead of sales and ahead of distribution.  As we go into the rest of the year, we think that a lot of the sponsorship expenses will level out during the year, but it was higher during the year in this first quarter. The legal costs have been high. There's been securities litigation. There's been quite a bit of litigation regarding our auction rate securities and trademarks and intellectual property. We just had to deal with that and it has, you know, paying attorneys isn't inexpensive. So that also has had an effect.
Mark Astrachan – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. Then in terms of the disruptions, the out of stocks that you cited, it sounds like that largely normalized after February, is that a fair assessment?
Rodney Sacks: Probably. It was clearly more weighted in the earlier part of the quarter. But there were instances where, even after February, we did have some instances where we sort of had some difficulties in tracking down deliveries or orders and verifying things. We just have had our challenges, I think, like everybody who's gone through a conversion to SAP has experienced; and we've had our share as well unfortunately. But we feel that, again as I indicated, I don't have a number to it, but we feel that it was, it hasn't been very material.
Mark Astrachan – Stifel Nicolaus: In terms of the pickup on a go-forward basis, do you feel like you needed to ship more product into the channels to make up for some of those lost sales, meaning that the second quarter or even third quarter numbers might be a bit stronger versus what we've seen in the scanner data as a result?
Rodney Sacks: I don't think so. I think if you're out of stock and you are out of stock, and then when you ship you get back into stock. You can't really load more on to the shelves of the consumer or the club stores, etc. That was one channel that was sort of down for us this quarter, club stores. We think that might have had something to do with that. But that was one of the reasons we saw some softness in sales was in the club channel, as I gave you in the ultimate breakup of the share of the business. We are looking at how to address that and how to get those channels back to growth.
Mark Astrachan – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. Then in terms of how you're thinking about Europe, in particular, on the international side going into the summer. You had talked a bit about trends seeming to get a little bit better there. But any sort of additional color as you start to head into the real summer selling season there would be helpful.
Rodney Sacks: Other than, really, I think I did give you guys pretty good direction on where we feel we will be in Europe in the second quarter. We think that will be a material improvement over last year. Sales are coming in. As I've indicated, April numbers sales are very positive and are up nicely. Orders for May are also up nicely. So the trends are very strong in our established markets. We are running out some of the new markets. Even in those markets, we are actually seeing some very good initial sales.  But it is very early, early days in markets like Hungary; but so far, so good. So we also planning to expand that. You know the costs of rolling out in Europe have been higher. The costs of actual products are higher production and your selling price are lower, so you are dealing with a lower margin. And costs, we're entering well established markets, which means that we really do have costs incurred up front in order to establish the brand.  But we think we're doing the right thing to establish the brand. The brand is definitely taking foot in Europe and becoming the clear number two player to Red Bull. We think that's the right way to continue to grow the brand in the long-term interests of the brand and the company.
Mark Astrachan – Stifel Nicolaus: Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from Caroline Levy – CLSA.
Michael [Avery] – CLSA: It's Michael Avery for Caroline. I was wondering if you could help me understand a little bit better the volume and price. I see the average net sales price per case. Looks like it was down kind of mid-single digit percent. Is that mix or how?
Rodney Sacks: It's primarily mix. The actual numbers for individual products like Monster in these numbers are not affected. The mix has been primarily due to peach tea, which is a higher volume. As you know, they're 12 packs of 24-ounce cans. You have got high volume at a relatively low cost. So that has had an effect. That's probably the major effect on our sales.  Also the way we account for sales overseas – because of the agreements we have, some of the costs go over the top line probably also have affected the net selling price to a lesser degree.
Michael [Avery] – CLSA: So the price increase in January on Monster, what kind of magnitude would that have been?
Rodney Sacks: Pretty much about a dollar a case. 
Michael [Avery] – CLSA: Then in percent terms, that's?
Rodney Sacks: It was a marketing fee as opposed to a price increase. That's about 4%. That really is a way of increasing, you're getting the money up front to support the marketing, the CMAs, and the actual marketing and advertising for the brand. It's not a price increase in that sense. Cash flow-wise, yes, it is. We get in the dollar and we, obviously, with spending it and how we expense it.
Michael [Avery] – CLSA: And on peach tea, what are the margins looking like there? Is that breaking even yet or does it?
Rodney Sacks: The margins are very thin. We think they're probably pretty much close to a break-even. But obviously the strategy there is to continue to develop the brand and establish the brand. And once we do that, we are all starting to really start looking at additional SKUs, which we believe will then be able to afford the company better margins as we continue to establish the brand. Then we'll also, at an appropriate time, look to basically removing the prepricing on the can and just pricing it according to promotional periods.
Michael [Avery] – CLSA: And for the European business, I assume obviously with some of the investment costs and ramping up just like you said establish the markets. Is that the same situation? Is it negative or is it just a small positive or near break-even kind of margins there?
Rodney Sacks: Europe was negative. I think I gave the figure was 3.9 between Europe and there was a small loss in Australia. It was 3.9 in the first quarter. That was, again, largely because of the disproportionate, as I indicated, sponsorship fees up front that were incurred in the first quarter. We believe that as we go forward with that, that will start rectifying itself and the percentages will be better.  We also are hopeful that we'll be able to get our production of the majority of our products produced by CCE for us. This was originally contemplated. There have been some delays in getting their plants up and running. We are hopeful that will start in the next month or two. That will, we believe, that will have a meaningful impact on lowering our costs in Europe. So, costs for the last year have been higher than we had anticipated due to additional freight and transport and production costs.
Michael [Avery] – CLSA: Okay. Could you give us a sense of when you think it might turn? Would the production being localized be the difference in flipping that towards the positive margin?
Rodney Sacks: We think that will contribute. It won't be the sole cause. The other cause will be, obviously, to get, you know you need minimum sales volume. You have a certain overhead that you have. As I said, all the endorsement and sponsorship costs. You have a fixed overhead of people and staff. And we believe that will get much closer to that as we go into the year. That will start improving. At this stage, I don't think it would be appropriate for us to give you any direction on that.
Michael [Avery] – CLSA: Okay. Great, thank you so much.

 :
John Faucher – JP Morgan: Thank you very much. Couple of questions. First off, starting on the sponsorship piece, is this something where I understand it's going to be higher right now; but is this something we should expect to continue to grow as you continue to enter new markets or is it something where you'd say, okay, we've got these properties and we can amortize them over multiple markets?
Rodney Sacks: I think the majority of the sponsorship costs, the very larger amounts, are what we would call international sponsorships. They will be leveraged across all the additional markets. We will need to continue to, obviously, continue to implement local marketing programs in each of the countries as we go into them.  But what we're doing is the marketing program for each of these countries is clearly modeled on the international piece, which rubs off on, gives credibility to, the brand that creates awareness for the brand through TV, you know, as been seen on TV, Formula One, Motor GP, all of those properties get shown in Euro Sport and get shown on TV around the world, Europe and around the world.  But on a per case basis, we should start seeing some real benefits and reductions as we continue to leverage those properties out in the rest of Europe because we're not planning on increasing the basically the international marketing spend for those international properties, the Valentino Rossi and the [inaudible] etc. It's the local market that we will simply have to ramp up in each country as we go into it.
John Faucher – JP Morgan: Great. And then one other question. Can you talk a little bit about, you guys have a tremendous amount of stuff on your plate right now between the SAP implementation and just entering an incredible number of new countries, plus all the competitive activity and the ramp-up you're seeing there. Can you talk to us in terms of how you're dealing with all of that added complexity of business and sort of focus on the investments you have made in terms of additional capabilities to handle what is, obviously, a much more complicated business model than it was just a couple of years ago. I am thinking mostly in terms of people etc., from that standpoint.
Rodney Sacks: What we've done is we've looked at how we're staffing. We have taken on additional people, and that's probably one of the reasons why, and higher paid people, more qualified people, one of the reasons we're seeing an increase in our payroll. We've taken on two, some key people to head up the business – one person, in particular, to head up our business in basically in central and eastern Europe. And we've also now taken on a new person, senior person, to help really head up, growing to heading up sales for western Europe. We are obviously taking on and staffing up to meet the additional staffing.  In the U.S., we've really created three business units. We have senior vice presidents heads of those units. Again, with that, we're staffing up individually with more qualified and higher qualified people in each of the units. We are sort of being cautious not to take on too much payroll expense; but at the same time, this is part of the reason we are having to staff up.  The actual implementation of the SAP system itself has required us to take on pretty senior consultants and experts to be able to manage that system. Ultimately, we believe that we will benefit from the benefits out of, there are benefits from the SAP system.  On the marketing side, we have taken on a new senior head to manage our sports marketing program. Again, it's becoming a global platform. We need somebody who's able to really market that and plan that more carefully and more rationally than historically.  We've also taken on a senior person to head up our internal graphics and support services department to be able to design, again, support our local marketing programs and new product introductions and designs as well as international. For the image of our brand, generally and even on the licensing side, we're being very cautious with how we deal with the brand and the Monster claw. We are gearing up to it. They're all growing pains, you know, any growing organization as we grow and as we continue to try and deal with the challenges that we are being presented with.
John Faucher – JP Morgan: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. At this time I will turn it back over to you, Mr. Sacks, for closing comments.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you. This quarter has been a challenging quarter for us. A lot of costs have been spent in sort of trying to lay the basis for our future growth and for the business. We do believe that we can look forward to positive results going forward in the second quarter and through the rest of the year. Sales trends are certainly starting to bear that out for us.  We also are going, obviously, taking steps to stabilize and to ensure that we don't increase our spend on sponsorships and supporting the brand, but we believe that ultimately is essential to feed the brand and make sure that it continues to have the growth for years to come. We don't want to cut back on that irrationally. So we all believe that we are continuing to grow and staffing up our company.  The fact of the matter is that we really believe that the brand continues to gain strength at retail, whether it's from the Nielsen numbers, from our numbers, when you really look at the core brand, the brand is strong, the energy category is continuing to grow, and we do believe and we're optimistic that we will be able to continue to show and deliver growth going forward. Thank you very much.

A copy of this information is also available on our Website www.hansens.com in the Investor Relations section. We will go to beverage market in general in many countries throughout the world and in the United States in particular continues to show softness. We continue to see positive growth in the energy drink category in the United States. In fact, according to Nielsen, energy drink sales in the convenience and gas and grocery channels on a 2008 to 2009 and 2009 to 2010 year-on-year comparison have grown for the fifth straight month. Sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel increased by 3.2% in the four weeks ended January 23, 2010 of the comparable period in 2009. The four-week period concerned, Monster sales increased by 11.3% over last year, while Red Bull sales increased by 8% over last year. Rockstar was down 2.1%, Amp is down 3.1%, Full throttle was down 15% and NOS was up 23.6%. Over the same four-week period, energy drink sales in the grocery channel grew by 3.8%. Monster sales in this channel were up 13.8%, while Red Bull’s sales were up 9%, and Rockstar sales were down 5.5%, AMP sales were also lower by 6.8%, while Full Throttle sales were lower about 26.5%, NOS’ sales were up 28.5%. According to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended January 23, 2010, Monster’s market share of the convenience and gas channel stood at 30.2% against Red Bull share at 35.4%, Rockstar share 10.4%, Amp share at 7.1%, Full Throttle’s share of 4% and NOS’ share of 4.3%. According to Nielsen, Red Bull’s market share for grocery channel for the four weeks ended January 23 is 40.8%, whereas Monster’s market share is 24.3% against Rockstar’s share of 11.8%. Amp share is 6.5, Full Throttle share is 2.5, and NOS’ share is 2.3. According to Nielsen for the 13 weeks through January 23rd, 2010 all outlets combined, the convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers excluding Wal-Mart, sales in the energy drink category increased 3.7% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 12.2% in the 13-week period concerned, while sales of Monster’s main competitor Red Bull increased by 9.4%. According to those reports, sales of Rockstar dropped 3.3%, sales of Amp dropped 4.3%, NOS increased 26.3% and sales of Full Throttle dropped 19.8%. In actual dollars, sales in the energy drink category increased by $40.4 million in the 13 weeks end of January 23, 2010. According to Nielsen, sales of Monster increased by $35.5 million as compared to Red Bull which increased by $35.2 million. Sales of Rockstar decreased by $4 million, sales of Amp decreased by $3.5 million. Sales of NOS increased by 9 million while sales of Full Throttle dropped by 9.8 million. According to Nielsen for the 13 weeks through January 23, all outlets combined Monster’s market share increased by 2.2 points to 29.2%, while Red Bull’s market share increased by 1.9 points to 36.4%. Rockstar’s market share decreased by 0.8 points to 10.6, while Amp’s market share decreased by 0.6 points to 7%. NOS’ market share increased 0.7 points to 3.9, while Full Throttle’s market share decreased by 1 point to 3.6. These figures exclude the emerging energy shot category, which reports separately. If the energy drink and energy shot categories are combined, the overall category grew 6.8% in the 13-week period concerned. According to Nielsen, sales of Java Monster represented approximately 13% of the sales of the Monster brand over the 13 weeks through January 23, which is a decrease of 1.6 percentage points as compared to 14.6% for the same period last year. The decline in the sales of Java Monster continued to be attributable primarily to the entry of Starbucks into the category in the middle of the second quarter of 2008, with a new line of Double Shot Energy plus Coffee Drinks in 15-ounce cans, which compete directly with Java Monster. In the 13 weeks ended January 23rd, 2010, for all outlets combined sales in the energy plus coffee drinks category increased 0.6% over the comparable period last year to 89.2 million. According to Nielsen, sales of Starbucks Double Shot Energy plus Coffee during the 13-week period concerned totaled $30.4 million as compared to sales of Java Monster, which totaled $42.6 million. Monster’s market share in the smaller drug channel has continued to show moderate but steady growth since the transition to Coca Cola bottlers in certain geographies at the end of 2008. We are taking steps to address the weakness of Monster sales in the Houston market, which includes the appointment of new representatives and a new team for that area. The Chicago market is also showing weakness in the last few months, although we are still the Number 1 brand and we are taking steps to address that market. On the other side, we are pleased to report that we have managed to reverse the softness that we experienced in the Detroit market and are recovering lost market share. Monster’s market share continues to improve in the important New York market. We continue to see improvements in sales and market share in Canada. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended January 16, 2010, the energy drinks category grew 8%, Monster’s market share increased 4.1 points over the same period last year to 19.7%, while Red Bull’s share decreased 1.6 points to 36.6, and Rockstar’s market share increased by 1.3 points to 14.3%. According to Nielsen, Monster’s market share in Mexico for December 2009 is 21.4%, which includes Java Monster and is up 0.3 points from December last year. Sales of Monster grew 34% over last year. In November, I reported that Monster’s market share in Mexico in September was 26%, although Monster’s current market share is decreased since September, its sales both in December and for the full 2009 calendar year increased in excess of a category growth for the respective periods. The monthly Nielsen numbers are often as proportionately influenced by promotions of one more brand in the influential convenience chain, which is significant in the convenience store channel in Mexico and should be demand looking at the Nielsen numbers for Mexico. Sales continue to progress satisfactorily in the United Kingdom and Continental Europe, although costs particularly promotional and sampling costs and sponsorship expenses were higher than anticipated in relation to our sales levels in 2009. We believe that increased sales in 2010 will lower our selling costs per case that we incurred last year and improve our financial result in Europe. We are planning to commence sales in additional countries in Western and Central Europe and are also planning to open up one or more markets in the Middle East this year. Sales of Monster are continuing to improve in South Africa, Ireland, and New Zealand, and we are pleased with the progress that we have made with the launch of Monster in Australia last year. Unfortunately, we have experienced continued delays in securing the necessary governmental authorizations to begin production in Brazil, but we have now received those authorizations as of yesterday or today, and we expect to commence production in the near future and launch distribution of our branding. We have to expand into additional countries in South America during the course of this year. Both gross and net sales for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2009 were positively impacted by bonds purchases made by customers in the 2009 fourth quarter due to our announcement of a new per case marketing contribution program for Monster Energy distributors commencing January 1, 2010, as well as to avoid potential interruptions in product supply due to our announcement to transition to the SAP enterprise resource planning system commencing January 2010. We estimate that although our gross sales, approximately 4% to 6% for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 and approximately 1% for the year ended December 2009, were due to such advance purchases. For the three months ended December 31, 2009, sales to retail growth through specialty chains and wholesalers represented 10% of growth sales at the same as last year. So, to club stores, drug channels, and mass merchandisers represented 9% of sales, down from 14% last year. Sales to full service distributors represented 69% of sales, down from 71% in the same period last year. Other sales were flat with last year at about 2%, and sales outside the US increased to 13% from 6% in the same period last year. Gross sales to customers outside the US in the fourth quarter of 2009 amounted to $43.3 million compared to $16.5 million in the same quarter last year. Included in such sales are direct sales to the company's military customers which are delivered in the US and then transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. We believe that we will continue to benefit from reductions in the cost of certain raw materials. Operating income for the 2009 fourth quarter includes losses of $1 million related to Xtruck Inc for the torque off-road truck racing series as well as operating losses of 5.2 million incurred in relation to our European and Australian operations. Operating income for the 12 months ended December 31, 2009 includes proceeds of $4.7 million related to reimbursements of legal expenses as well as losses of $4 million related to Xtruck for the torque off-road truck racing series and related to Epicenter Music Festival LLC, as well as operating losses of $6.9 million incurred in relation to our European and Australian operations. We are continuing to implement our strategy to reduce the processing of Monster Hitman energy shots to $1.99 at retail from $2.99, which we believe is more processed with energy drink pricing, although retailers have been slow to reduce their margins and implement that policy. We believe that we should persist with that strategy and we will continue to do so in 2010. We are also evaluating other opportunities in and ways of attacking the energy shot market. In December 2009, we launched our Peach Tea line of ready-to-drink ice teas in four flavors in 23-ounce cans. Initial response from consumers have been positive and we are excited about the prospects for that line. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $328.3 million compared to $256.8 million at December 31, 2008. Short-term investments were $18.5 million compared to $29.1 million at December 31, 2008. Long-term investments consisting of auction rate securities decreased from $89.6 million to $80.8 million. Trade accounts receivables net increased to $104.2 million from $45.2 million at December 31, 2008, partly attributable to the advanced purchases made by customers. Distribution agreement receivables decreased to $4.7 million from $19.7 [ph] million at December 31, 2008. Days outstanding for receivables was 31.4 days at December 31, 2009, compared to 16.9 days at December 31, 2008. Inventories decreased to $108.1 million from a $116.3 million at December 31, 2008. Average days of inventory was 71.8 days at December 31, 2009, which is lower than the 90 days of inventory at December 31, 2008. In our 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, we have provided certain financial information regarding terminated and new distribution agreements. We explained the impact of the termination payments made to terminated distributors to the income statement, i.e. the full amount was expensed in 2008 including those distributors where we commenced distribution in 2009 namely Mexico and Canada. We also explained that while we received non-refundable contributions from newly appointed distributors which covered a significant portion of the costs of terminating certain distributors, such contributions are accounted for as deferred revenue. Such deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue right to be over the anticipated 20-year life of the new distribution agreements. Deferred revenue recognized was $1.9 million in the fourth quarter compared to $12.8 million in the comparable financial period last year. This explains the accounting treatment relating to the above. From a cash flow perspective, the above described transactions are expected to remain largely neutral to the company as we anticipate payments for the contributions approximate the payments to terminated distributors. Termination obligations recorded by us to prior distributors for the 2009 fourth quarter were $0.02 [ph] million as compared to $118.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. At December 31, 2009, the company held auction rate securities with a face value of $96.4 million. The company determined that an impairment of $12.1 million had occurred at December 31, 2009, of which $7.7 million was deemed temporary and $4.4 million was deemed other-than-temporary. Included in other comprehensive loss is $4.6 million net of taxes for the 12 months ended December 31, 2009. Included in interest and other income, net is $3.9 million for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2009. The auction rate securities will continue to accrue interest at their contractual rates until their respective auctions succeed or they are redeemed. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the company purchased, repurchased 1,008,729 shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $34.91 per share. I would like to open the floor to questions. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with UBS. Please go ahead.
Kaumil Gajrawala – UBS: Yes, hi everybody.
Rodney Sacks: Hi.
Kaumil Gajrawala – UBS: If we could start with, what do you think the impact on the first quarter will be from some of the pull-forward on SAP and the change in the concentrate terms. And then maybe if you could also give us a little update on how the first quarter is shaping up so far?
Rodney Sacks: The numbers, I think we gave you the indication, it was in the 4% to 6% range. We feel that, that’s as close as we are able to really put at it, and then it’s about 1% for the year. So, we think that obviously it’s that level will detract from the first quarter.
Kaumil Gajrawala – UBS: Okay, and it’s not something that would stretch up further than that, likely just a one quarter issue?
Rodney Sacks: No, no.
Kaumil Gajrawala – UBS: Okay.
Rodney Sacks: I don’t think so.
Kaumil Gajrawala – UBS: And then the second thing, it looked like SG&A was a little bit higher than we had expected, was there anything in there we should know about?
Rodney Sacks:
 : And so that litigation is also being reasoned, quite expensively, we also go litigation regarding the auction rate securities. So, litigation in the legal accounting was up quite a bit in the last quarter versus last year. Depreciation was also quite a bit higher. We have purchased quite a number of coolers that we put into the market through the Coke and through the CCE and AB system. You know, some of the legal costs have been – I will refer to (inaudible) have been capitalized, but there is a reasonably large amount of lodge increase of illegal costs. So, those are the two areas that I think a few years is it really did increase in this last quarter or the last year.
Kaumil Gajrawala – UBS: Yes, that’s helpful. And then final question, obviously I am sure you have seen the Coca Cola news from today. In terms of how your contracts are in, does that change your view on the Coca Cola rollout, and does it give you any flexibility to maybe consider any auctions beyond just CCE.
Rodney Sacks: You know, obviously we are going to look at the whole situation. The contracts are quite complex, there are a number of individual contracts for different countries particularly as between Europe, there are different contracts for Europe, Canada and United States for CCE. They are interlinked and so, you know, our issues with all of them need to be addressed carefully. There are certain non-assignment clause, but at the same time, the awesome call outs of which provides sort of assignments are permitted to – so we need to look at that whole issue, but you know, from our point of view, at this point it appears to us that there wouldn’t be a major change. At this point, we wouldn’t be looking at changing, it may well open up additional countries in Europe to CCE, but you know, it is too premature for us to look at. We have really not seen the full terms of the transaction. We had discussion with the Kayo folk, we are going to be talking to the CCE, had a chance to talk to them. Prior to this call, probably got to talk them later today, early tomorrow. From our point of view at this point in time really much, it’s business as usual. The whole transaction in any vein is going to take pretty close to probably year or two. To close, there are going to be incentives to CCE, obviously it’s continued to maximize their profitability in this interim period. And so, we have really done, believe it’s going to have a major impact on us. The movie changes but we don’t think that there will be major but obviously, we want to look at where we, you know, our position as an independent company about share and you know reevaluate things. But it is too premature to do so.
Kaumil Gajrawala – UBS: Okay, that’s all. Thank you.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Faucher with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Pardon me, John Faucher, your line is open. Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Thanks, hi guys.
Rodney Sacks: Hi Judy.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Rodney, I guess I am trying to understand your view as underlying sales trend in the fourth quarter, because if I strip out the international sales, the growth that you have had in the quarter. It looks like US is up about 4%, that I would assume includes obviously the advanced purchases that were made in the fourth quarter, and then I know that you are laughing some drags that happened last year with you buying the old inventory from the distributors. So, I guess my question is really why the underlying US number wasn’t stronger just given the acceleration in terms of the nukes and data that we have seen recently.
Rodney Sacks: I have got, I think my North American revenues up about 6%.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: How much?
Rodney Sacks: In last quarter.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Okay, that includes Canada, obviously okay. Right, but that included about 4% of the advanced purchases in the fourth quarter that happened right.
Rodney Sacks: Yes.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Okay. So, underlying it looks like maybe it’s even kind of in the low-single digits, this number.
Rodney Sacks: Yes, yes American is probably reasonably reaping in couple of points out.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Yes, and I am trying to sort of figure out why there is a disconnect in terms of the scanner data that would show an acceleration to kind of a high-single digit, maybe even double-digit number in the last couple of months versus kind of what you are reporting as you US being maybe up low single?
Rodney Sacks: You know, when we say there was that increase that purchase in anticipation, one of the things we do know is that the CCE system didn’t and not to the best of our belief, participate in that volume, and in fact, they actually took their inventories down. They minimized their inventories at yearend. So, they are on business policy. And so, that we believe is probably had some influence on our shipments out as opposed to the market. I don’t know other wide, you know, why there is that disconnect between the two. Obviously the important thing for us and that’s why we do go through the Nielsen numbers. We have done so historically. The importance for us is to what is going on and what are the – or what is the movement on a store well. And that momentum has been positive and has been continuing to actually increase. And so, that is important for us, and so that is really the – I just can’t give you any additional color on that, but the other thing I can also say that those are, bear in mind, that those are the combined numbers of the company, both DSD, allied products, non-core and warehouse, and then if you break those down which we broke down on the DSD, the DSD and the warehouse statement, in that fourth quarter, the warehouse statement was negative. Some of the other products based on year-on-year, the allied products were in fact down. And also negative where is Monster itself as a brand was actually up. So, if you look at those numbers, in fact in the fourth quarter, we are all up into the teens. That includes internationals, all right I haven’t been able to break out that. That’s the figure for you. I am sorry – but I think that you will find that the Monster numbers in the fourth quarter were better than the 2% odd when you strip out that volume.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Okay.
Rodney Sacks: Because as I said, that is an aggregate figure I am seeing negative figures for some of these others. I just haven’t done that exercise that you are doing now; you are doing it on a gross consolidated basis for the company. So, that actually will affect, in fact result in a lesser differential between the Nielsen numbers coming out and our numbers.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Okay. Maybe taking a step back and broadly speaking, you know, seen acceleration and the category growth trend in recent months, maybe you can talk about what you think is driving that improvement as we look out over the next six to 12 months, you know, obviously consumers are still challenged by maybe in the back half, you start to lapse some of the easier comparisons particularly in the summertime. Do you think that maybe the category and your brands growth should continue to accelerate as the year progresses?
Rodney Sacks: I don’t know and we can’t obviously look into the future and we don’t give guidance. But what I can say, if you look at the Monster numbers in the – according to Nielsen in the four-week numbers, you know, we were positive earlier in ’09, we should have – May to July, we were sort of negative and then we started improving in from August on. And our growth in the convenience channel has continued to accelerate. It was slightly down in December – January versus December, but it was sort of we were up, in convenience, over that period, we were up 3, 7, 5, 8, 6, 5, 10, 5, 13, 6, and 11, 3 [ph]. So, we have seen some acceleration in our year-on-year numbers and we are talking on – but in those periods we were talking on numbers from the ’09 numbers that were although lower in the growth rate, but we are still positive year-on-year from the year before that. If you take in the last four weeks, looking at Nielsen, in fact if you take our top four items, they are actually all positive, which we think is good for the brand. Our original energy drink, our low carb, our 23.5-ounce package is actually positive in the four weeks and our low carb 23.5-ounce package is also positive, and that’s encouraging because the 23-ounce which has been slow, it has been negative over the large part of 2009. So, we do seem to be seeing some stronger numbers there, and even Java Monster, the two leading Java Monster brands were both positive in the last four-week period.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then just finally, in terms of your marketing expenses, you know, I think earlier in 2009, just given the economy and sort of the sluggishness of the category you have filed back in terms of some of the spending and not spending, you know, sort of ahead of your sales growth and etcetera, at this point, are you still kind of adopting that strategy or with some of the improvement you are seeing, you think that you have the opportunity to maybe spend more to accelerate growth and that how should we think about the international spending as you let that happen in 2009 and now in 2010, I think you said that the level of spending on a per head basis could be lower?
Rodney Sacks: Yes, you know, level of spending, we had certainly in endorsements and sponsorships put in place last year towards late in the year. We did sign additional sponsorships which we thought were important for the longer term strength of the brand and that did lift our sort of promotional cost a little bit. Going forward to this year, we kept our spending here pretty much in line with last year, and that is why we believe we will be able to have a more effective, you know, spend per case. We also in the US, we have a marginal increase in our plan spending. We are going to be conservative. So, what we have done is going out for the first quarter, we sort of budgeted for a marginal increase in our promotional spend and sponsorships and endorsements and depending on how we see the sales come in, we will be able to ramp up you know, that. So, again we didn’t want to project too large an increase that we were overspending. So, we are sort of looking at the year prudently just because of the uncertainty, but with the positive trend, we will step that up if we start seeing the underlying sales trend improving.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thanks.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Jeff Hans – Citigroup: Thanks. This is Jeff Hans actually on the line for Greg. In light of some of your sales being pulled forward, have you guys been a bit more aggressive from promotions and discounts in January and February?
Rodney Sacks: No, we sort of – as part of that program, we have had more of a planned program going forward for 2010, and we are just going to see how that pans out as being too much more, you know, starting to be really done that promotions on an ad hoc basis and so we probably get more planning into it and we will see whether that’s positive or negative, we are not sure which way it will go, but we will try and do it in a more orderly fashion, but we are not trying to spend on high rates. The initial couple of months this year, particularly we haven’t been aggressive in that spend. If you look at the convenience numbers for our every sales price, you know, for the first – that’s the 13-week we are talking, the four-week number, I will pull it out, our sales price is pretty much two sales up on our regular package for the four weeks. So, we have pretty much been consistent. So, we have not overspent to become overaggressive.
Jeff Hans – Citigroup: Okay, then could you give at least a near term update or outlook on commodity costs and how those have been trending?
Rodney Sacks: I have got Hilton who could probably speak, probably closer to that than I am.
Hilton Schlosberg: Most of our aluminum cans, we are just at (inaudible) last year and got the benefit of the lower metal. We are exposed for part of the aluminum cans, sugar pricing has increased, and that has impacted certain parts of this business. Sucrose costs which we are big consumers of sucrose, sucrose cost effect has come down, and I am not sure what other commodities you would like to talk about. Juice, thank you, apple juice concentrate, we contracted earlier this year at very low pricing effect, lower than the market is today. So, we did well on our apple juice concentrate purchases as well.
Jeff Hans – Citigroup: Great, that’s very helpful. That’s all I have, thank you.
Rodney Sacks: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alton Stump with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.
Alton Stump – Longbow Research: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon.
Rodney Sacks: Hi Alton.
Alton Stump – Longbow Research: You know, it was a great result obviously on the raw international sales line, can you give us any sort of color or commentary on how much of that is Europe and then if you are seeing the same strength in Europe that you had overall outside the US?
Rodney Sacks: Our sales for the year in Europe are about just over $56 million equivalent. And you know, so that is sort of the breakup for Europe, the Mexico, Canada is about – just under 66, and the remaining international sales, which include some military use about nearly 46 million. That really makes up the international business. And so, we believe that we have got some good strong sales numbers in Europe. We are sort of, you know, breaking into the markets slowly learning to walk, and so, we think that we have set a good basis and that we are sort of positive for 2010 now for ourselves in 2010 in Europe. Australia, we are positive about and we all are going to look at some additional expansion as we continue to go into the year.
Alton Stump – Longbow Research: Thank you. Rodney, how are things going in the UK, obviously it had a bit slower loss there, has that picked up at all over the last couple of months there?
Rodney Sacks: We think we have seen a positive change in the bottler, at the bottler level with some of the – they have started to see the brand and what its strength can be at its pulling, and they have started to, you know, support the brand for better. So, we are seeing a lot more excitement from the bottler and cooperation. We are starting to see, we haven’t – it’s probably still premature, but we are hopeful to get some quite meaningful listings in the next month or two. We are just waiting for them to come through. We are doing quite nicely. And in some of the chains, you know, we have done quite well. I know that, Alton, I think that you perhaps might have looked at it, as the chain had some issue with the – as the chain where we were included not on the warm shelf, we actually think that’s a positive. We are actually doing better in that chain, that relentless in some of the other brand. So, the chain has actually been a very positive sale for us to be in the coolers. So, to be in the single-serve coolers is actually a plus in the energy category, it might not be in the traditional type category, multi-type products. But in the energy, it certainly, we actually would prefer to be in the culture of single-serve than we would on warm on the – it certainly at this point in time, as the brand continues to mature and becomes a much, much bigger brand in the context of the, you know, consumers, then obviously it becomes important to have your four packs and your multi-packs on shelf. But at this stage, we are quite happy with that particular retail chain actually. So, by and large, you know, obviously we always have issues to face and things to deal with, but we think that there, you know, we have our challenges, but overall, we all think the brand is building strongly and generally the bottler partners are happy with the progress and so are generally our customers, the retailers.
Alton Stump – Longbow Research: Okay. Great. Thank you Rodney, I appreciate it.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.
Mark Astrachan – Stifel Nicolaus: Hi, good afternoon guys.
Rodney Sacks: Hi Mark.
Mark Astrachan – Stifel Nicolaus: First question on Peach Tea, could you just tell us if you can what the sell-in was for the fourth quarter and just what your thoughts are in going through 2010 in terms of kind of what level of shelf space you guys are anticipating and how you are thinking the brand can do?
Rodney Sacks: You know Peach Tea, pretty late in the year, in December. Sales in December about 1.4 million. So, there is not a – it wasn’t a lot, but it’s selling through quite, you know, very nicely. I think it sold out in a number of accounts that it was placed in, which has caused CCE to redo their estimates and their stockholding numbers and they have been looking in January and February, you know, they have increased orders. The sell rates have been, we have been receiving reports from the market that are positive for the brand. They are positive about it and behind the brand. And you know, we are in the process of just finalizing further arrangements with the coat system with regard to Peach Tea and when those will finalize, we will probably expand Peach Tea into the remaining Coke bottlers. If for some reason, those arrangements don’t come to fruition, obviously we will then look to fill out the rest of the US with independence, but it is looking positive that we will be able to put something together with Coke and with the other Coke bottlers. So, overall, we are pretty happy with it. We want to obviously sync with our strategy at the moment of continuing to get distribution. We are starting to present the brand to the change in order to get into the schematics and get listings. In the meantime, we have gone on to and gone on to shelf simply on an independent basis, on an ad hoc basis, and you know, so far, as I said, we believe that the brand has legs, that’s the report we are getting back and that’s the belief that CCE have. And so, we are all encouraged by the brand going forward. Once we start establishing the 23-ounce can, as I said, we get the right schematics and listings, we will obviously looking for at least one slicing of each of the four SKUs and in some case, we would obviously like to get more which would give us a shelf. But even at a half a shelf to start in convenience and then we will pull with additional SKUs both in 23-ounce and then possibly look to additional package sizes going forward to, you know, much later in the year.
Mark Astrachan – Stifel Nicolaus: Great. And then share repurchase, any update on the new authorization?
Rodney Sacks: We do have it under consideration, it is premature, but certainly we more or less use up the existing one. We have about 10 million unutilized, and the issue will be whether we just go through that and then have a new share repurchase or at an early stage reconsider a full share repurchase. You know, we will look at that at the board meeting we have tomorrow, and we will either decide then or probably within the next couple of weeks, but we are going to look at a new repurchase program certainly to implement for the company.
Mark Astrachan – Stifel Nicolaus:
 :
Rodney Sacks: I think that’s individual, I don’t think I am really in a position to be able to really comment on that. Obviously we believe that’s going to be positive and more efficient from a per case point of view. But we are working through that, we have got other programs that are slightly different to that. In some cases, there is a pay-for-performance program with retailers, but with our distributors, we have gone more on a fixed cost per case where we are going to allocate and then from that allocation, we will look at individual programs as to how we share certain costs, certain costs will be allocated. So, in fact, in some cases, the cost spend from the distributor point of the bottler is going away from sort of a pay-for-performance other than it’s going to be per case. So, we are not obviously spending something globular (inaudible) that will come through. But you know, it’s obviously – it’s too soon for me to be able to really relate to you what the results are because I really don’t have enough of a feel for it ourselves.
Mark Astrachan – Stifel Nicolaus: Would you think that, that would result in some leverage on the promotional allowances line, like what you saw in the fourth quarter?
Rodney Sacks: You know, obviously we are hoping to get something more – for the dollar that we spent, but how that’s going to translate and whether that translates better, we have this program that we have implemented, we don’t know. It really just is too soon to tell. We think it will be more efficient, and we are hoping it will be, but you know, we will see by the end of the first quarter, I suppose.
Mark Astrachan – Stifel Nicolaus: Great, thank you.
Rodney Sacks: All right. Pleasure is ours.
Operator: At this time, I would like to turn it back to the management team for any closing remarks.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you. You know, as I indicated earlier, we think that the brand is doing very nicely, that the category is growing. So, we are positive going forward for the year as well as both for our North American business as well as international. We really are still trying to evaluate the decision between Coke CCE. We think it will be business as usual, but we actually may end up as I indicated earlier with some additional distribution opportunities in Europe. It maybe not immediately but in the next short period of time. So, we think it may end up being positive, but we are going to look at all aspects of it, and then we will deal with it from there. So, just too premature to give you any other color on it. I would like to thank everybody for attending the call and we have a call that’s not too far away for our first quarter results and hopefully we will be able to then give you more color on the transaction at that time. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Hansen Natural Corporation fourth quarter 2009 financial results conference call. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Conferencing. You may now disconnect.

===== 2009 Q3  (2009-11-07 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Rodney Sacks – Chairman and CEO
Analysts: Kaumil Gajrawala – UBS Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs Alec Patterson – Dresdner RCM Global Investors Geoff [ph] – Citigroup Mark Astrachan – Stifel Nicolaus
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Hansen Natural Corporation third quarter 2009 fiscal results. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator instructions) As a reminder, this conference is maybe recorded today. And now I would like to turn the program over to our host Rodney Sacks. Please go ahead.
Rodney Sacks: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I am Rodney Sacks; Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, he is with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on management’s current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made herein. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed on March 2, 2009, and our most recent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, including the sections contained therein entitled risk factors and forward-looking statements for discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measures of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated November 5, 2009. A copy of this information is also available on our website www.hansens.com in the Investor Relations section. The beverage market in many countries through out the world and in the United States in particular continues to show softness. Both Coca-Cola and Pepsi continued to report lower North American sales volumes. Although we are seeing some positive signs in the US economy, the housing market still appears to be under pressure and there is little sign of new boarding activity. This continues to hamper the spending power of US consumers which we believe disproportionately affect the discretionary spending power of our consumers. Positive news however is that according to the Nielsen reports for the five weeks ended September 26, 2009 energy drink sales both in the convenience and gas and grocery channels on a year-on-year comparison grew for the first time since March. Sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel increased by 0.9% over the five week period last year. Over the five week period concerned, Monster sales increased by 5.4% over last year while Red Bull sales increased by 5.3%. Rockstar was down 4%, AMP was down 4.4%, Full Throttle was down 13.1%, while NOZ was up 23.2%. Over the same five week period, sales in the grocery channel grew by 2.1%. Monster sales in this channel were up 9.8%, while Red Bull’s sales were up 8%, and Rockstar sales were down 5.6%, AMP sales were also lower by 16.5%, while Full Throttle sales were down 21%, NOZ’s sales were up 33.1%. According to Nielsen, Monster’s market share of the convenience and gas channel has continued to increase from 27.8% at the beginning of the year to 30% in the five week period ended December 26, 2009. Red Bull share is up from 33.4% at the beginning of the year to 34.8%, while Rockstar share decreased from 11.2% to 10.4%, and AMP share decreased from 7.6% to 7.2% since the beginning of the year. According to Nielsen, Red Bull’s market share of the grocery channel has remained flat through September 26, 2009 at 37.7%. Since the beginning of the year, Monster share increased from 22.4% to 24.6%, while Rockstar share decreased from 12.9% to 12.6%. AMP share decreased from 7.7% to 6.8%, while Full Throttle share decreased from 3.7% to 2.9%. And NOZ’s share increased from 1.9% to 2.3%. According to Nielsen for the 13 weeks through September 26, 2009 all outlets combined, convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers excluding Wal-Mart, sales in the energy drink category declined 1.1% versus a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 3.3% in the 13 week period concerned, while sales of Monster’s main competitor Red Bull increased by 1.9%. According to such reports, sales of Rockstar dropped 6.5%, sales of AMP dropped 10.6%, Full Throttle dropped 11.3% and NOZ was up 22.9%. In actual dollar sales in the energy drink category by decreased by a total of $13.5 million in the 13 week period concerned. According to Nielsen, sales of Monster however increased by $11.4 million as compared to sales of Red Bull which increased by $9.4 million. Sales of Rockstar decreased by $9.3 million and sales of AMP decreased by $7.5 million. Sales of Full Throttle decreased by $6.9 million, while sales of NOZ increased by $8.6 million. According to Nielsen for the 13 weeks concerned all outlets combined Monster’s market share increased by 1.2 points to 28.8%, while Red Bull’s market share increased 1 point to 35.4%. Rockstar’s market share was down 0.6 points to 10.7%. AMP’s market share was down 0.5 points to 7.3%. Full Throttle’s market share dropped 0.5 points to 4.1% and NOZ’s market share increased 0.7 points to 3.7%. These figures exclude the emerging energy shot category which is reported separately. If the energy drink and energy shot categories are combined, the overall category grew 3.3% in the 13 week period concerned. According to Nielsen, sales of Java Monster represented approximately 13.1% of the sales of the Monster brand over the 13 weeks through September 26, which is a decrease of 1.6% as compared to 14.7% last year. The decrease in the percentage of our sales represented by Java Monster contributed in part to the increase in gross margin percentage achieved by us during the quarter. In this regard, we are pleased to note that the gross margin percentage of the warehouse division also improved during the quarter. While sales of Java Monster were lower than 2008, the decline is primarily attributable to Starbucks entering the category in the middle of the second quarter of 2008 with a new line of DoubleShot energy plus coffee drinks in 16 ounce cans which directly compete with Java Monster. In the 13 weeks ended September 26, 2009 for all outlets combined, sales in the energy plus coffee drinks category increased 5% over the comparable period last year to $103.7 million. Although sales of the energy plus coffee drinks category are higher than last year, the category is being split between two major participants. According to Nielsen, sales of Starbucks DoubleShot energy plus coffee drinks in the 13 week period concerned amounted to $35.5 million as compared to sales of Java Monster in the same period which amounted to $47.1 million. Java Monster continues to out sell Starbucks coffee plus energy products by a large margin. Sales of our other competitor's products namely Rockstar Roasted and Full Throttle coffee drinks also substantially lower. Monster’s market share in the much smaller drug and mass channel, which excludes Wal-Mart has remained stable since the transition at the end of last year. We believe that there is opportunity for us to increase our market share in that channel and we are taking steps to address that channel. I am pleased to report that our overall market share both in Atlanta and Florida has continued to improve and is now higher than it was prior to the transition to the current system. Although CCE is making progress in Texas, we are still not back to the pre-transition share levels in that market. The convenience channel in Houston, which is a large independent market continues to be a challenge. Interestingly Detroit, which is also a large independent market has also shown softness since the transition, although Monster is still the leading energy drink brand in that market. While the transition to certain of the new AB Distributors has also had its challenges, we are continuing to work through the issues that we encountered. Overall, the transition in November last year is paying dividends. According to Nielsen, for the five week period ended September 26, 2009 Monster’s market share in the convenience and gas and grocery channels nationally increased to 30% and 24.6% respectively from 28.3% and 22.6% at November last year. We are hopeful that we will continue to benefit from our alignment with the two strongest beverage distribution systems in the United States. We are continuing to see improvements in sales as well as gains in market share in Canada. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended September 26, 2009 despite sales of the energy drinks being down 5% overall, Monster’s market share increased by 6.2 points over the same period last year to 20.1%, while Red Bull share decreased by 0.3 points to 38.8%, and Rockstar’s market share decreased by 3.6 points to 12.2%. Monster also continued to improve its sales and market share in Mexico. Monster now holds a 26% share of the energy drink market in Mexico. Sales are progressing satisfactorily in continental Europe and although we were off to a slower start in the United Kingdom, distribution levels of sales there continue to improve. Overall, sales in the United Kingdom and Europe were in line with the expectations. However, promotional and sampling costs and sponsorship expenses were higher than anticipated. We were fortunate to have sponsored both the new Formula One World Champion, Jenson Button, and the MotoGP World Champion, Valentino Rossi, which has resulted in wide exposure for the Monster brand worldwide. We have appointed a new distributor in Ireland. Sales of Monster energy commenced in Australia during the third quarter through Schweppes Australia Pty Ltd. Initial response from both retailers as well as consumers in Australia has been positive and we continue to be excited about the prospects for the Monster brand in Australia. We are continuing with our plans to produce and launch Monster Energy in Brazil later this year. We also launched Monster Energy in Finland at the end of the third quarter. For the three months ended September 30, 2009, sales through retail grocery specialty chains and wholesalers represented 6% of gross sales, down from 8% last year. Sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 12% of our sales which is flat with the previous year. Sales to full service distributors represented 65% of sales, down from 68% in the same period last year. Other sales were 3%, up from 2%. And sales outside the US increased to 14% from 10% in the same period last year. Gross sales to customers outside the US amounted to $50 million compared to $30.7 million in the same quarter last year. Included in such sales are direct sales to the company's military customers which were delivered in the US and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. We believe that we will continue to benefit from reductions in the cost of raw materials overall although we expect continuing increases in the price of sugar. Operating income for the 2009 third quarter includes proceeds of $4.7 million related to reimbursements of legal expenses as well as losses of $2.5 million related to Xtruck Inc for the torque off road truck racing series and related to Epicenter Music Festival LLC, as well as operating losses of $0.7 million incurred in relation to our European and Australian operations. Operating income from the nine months ended September 30, 2009 includes proceeds of $4.7 million related to reimbursements of legal expenses as well as losses of $3 million related to Xtruck Inc for the torque off road truck racing series and related to Epicenter Music Festival LLC, as well as operating losses of $1.7 million incurred in relation to our European and Australian operations. In the third quarter, gross sales of Monster import which is in a 550 ml resealable can and is manufactured in Europe and imported into the United States were approximately $8.4 million. While sales of X-Presso Monster and new non-carbonated diary-based espresso energy drink which was launched shortly before the end of the second quarter amounted to approximately $4.3 million in the third quarter. Sales of unused Nitrous Monster Energy line of carbonated energy drinks which are packaged in resealable 12-ounce sleek cans and come in three versions amounted to approximately $13 million in the third quarter. The package in the Monster Energy range that continues to have been hit hardest by the economic downturn is up 24-ounce size package which is consistent with our belief that the weak US economy has disproportionately affected blue-collar workers who make up a large portion of our consumer base and to all the principal purchasers of our 24-ounce size packages. Sales of Monster Energy in 16-ounce size cans in the United States increased in the third quarter of 2009 over the same period last year, while sales of Monster Energy in 24-ounce size cans in the United States decreased from the same period last year. Turning to the energy shot category, according to Nielsen, the market share of the Monster Hitman Line of Energy Shooters is close to that of Red Bull energy shots which were launched recently and well ahead of NOZ, Rockstar and Full Throttle energy shots. However, there is a large gap between Five Hour Energy's market share and that of the other energy drink entries in that sector. We are not satisfied with the sales rate of our Monster Hitman Line of Energy Shooters. We believe that the retail price points of energy shots is excessive when compared with the retail price points of energy drinks. Accordingly, we are implementing a strategy to reduce the processing of Monster Hitman energy shots to $1.99 at retail which we believe is more in line with energy drink pricing. At this time, it is premature for us to comment further on the strategy. We are also evaluating other opportunities in and ways of attacking the energy shot market. We recently decided to launch a new line of ready to drink ice teas in 23-ounce cans under the Peach Tea brand name. Ready to drink ice tea is a large and growing category that is dominated by two competitors, and which our largest single customer does not have a credible challenger. Our strategy is to launch this line with aggressively pre-priced products to provide real value and encourage trial by consumers. Once we are able to establish the brand through trial we plan to rationalize pricing in the market and introduce additional packages with higher margins. In this way, we hope to take advantage of an unusual opportunity that exists to establish a volume brand and create long-term value for shareholders. The Peach Tree line will initially be launched in four flavors, green tea, imported salon tea, sweet lemon tea and razzleberry tea in 23-ounce size cans which will be pre-priced at $0.99. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $317.7 million compared to $256.8 million at the end of December 2008. Short-term investments were $30.2 million compared to $29.1 million at the end of December 2008. Investments which are primarily auction rate securities decreased from $89.6 million to $88 million. Trade accounts receivables net increased to $91.9 million from $45.2 million at the end of December and distribution agreement receivables decreased to $5.4 million from $19.7 million at December 31, 2008. Days outstanding for receivables was 26.9 days at September 30, 2009, compared to 16.9 days at December 31, 2008, and 23 days at September 30, 2008. Inventories increased to $123.9 million from a $116.3 million at December 31, 2008. Average days of inventory was 78 days at June 30, 2009 which is lower than the 90 days of inventory at December 31, 2008. In our 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, we have provided certain financial information regarding terminated and new distribution agreements. We explained the impact of the termination payments made to terminated distributors to the income statement, i.e. the full amount was expensed in 2008 including those distributors where we commenced distribution in 2009 mainly Mexico and Canada. We also explained that while we received non-refundable contributions from newly appointed distributors which covered a significant portion of the costs of terminating certain distributors such contributions are accounted for as deferred revenue. Such deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue right to be over the anticipated 20 year life of the distribution agreements. Deferred revenue recognized was $1.8 million in the quarter compared to $0.5 million in the comparable financial period last year. This explains the accounting treatment relating to the above. From a cash flow point of view, the above described transactions are expected to remain largely neutral to the company as we anticipated that we would receive payments for the contributions that approximate the payments to be made by us to terminated distributors. Termination obligations recorded by us to prior distributors for the 2009 third quarter were $0.1 million as compared to termination benefits recorded by us of $0.2 million for the third quarter of 2008. During the nine months ended September 30, 2009 the company redeemed 12.3 million of its auction rate securities at par. At September 30, 2009 the company held auction rate securities with a face value of $100.2 million, $105 million at June 30, 2009 and $112.5 million at December 31, 2008. The company determined that a cumulative impairment of $12.1 million had occurred at September 30, 2009, $12.3 million as of June 30, 2009 and $14.9 million as of December 31, 2008, of which $7.6 million was deemed temporary and $4.5 million was deemed other than temporary as a result included as a commencement of other comprehensive loss is $4.5 million net of taxes as of September 30 2009. Included in other income or expense other than temporary impairment of $3.3 million and $3.9 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2009. The auction rate securities will continue to accrue interest at contractual rates until their respective auctions succeed or they are redeemed. During the third quarter, the company repurchased 1.6 million shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $31.96 per share. I would like to open the floor to questions. Thank you.
Operator: Thanks sir. (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with UBS. Please go ahead.
Kaumil Gajrawala – UBS: Hi everybody, hi Rodney, hi Hilton.
Rodney Sacks: Hi.
Kaumil Gajrawala – UBS: It looks like selling expenses kicked up as a percentage of sales. You talked about some of the sponsorships in the UK. Are there any other areas specifically you have kicked up selling expenses? And to what degree are they related to the new countries that you are rolling out and to what degree are they related to some of the new products in the US?
Rodney Sacks: I think that pretty much across the board the expenses that we have been incurring in Europe are higher than they’re been in the US, and that’s where you have seen when you combined and you – the two, you end up with the higher rate. As a percentage, small items for example like simple things like point of sale and premiums as a percentage of sales have just been substantially higher in Europe and UK particularly, samples are also higher and the sponsorship fee. As I indicated earlier, the – we have tried to sort of split the cost of the sponsorships that we had particularly that are particularly appropriate to Europe, for example, the Jensen Button and the Rossi sponsorships and MotoGP. But despite even though you do that and trying to portion it, obviously it’s weighted heavily and you find that the costs are just moving up on the sponsorships. I mean the end result is that those particular promotional properties are very beneficial to the company and the brand and will be going forward, because those basically promotional events take place in countries that we are going into, take place in countries where the races are televised, for example, Australia, both of those sports are very popular, Brazil, F1 racing, Formula One is very popular. So they are going after and those are going to prove beneficial as we continue to expand internationally. Additionally, we took a decision to invest in basically it’s called torque off road truck racing, it’s a series, the previous series had sort of folded. And we decided to invest in a new series and take a different approach to the promotion to sort of take an ownership stake in. So hopefully over a period of time, hopefully we will be able to reduce our ongoing cost of promoting these sports which we think are key to our consumer demographic. And so you had that much higher – that loss that I referred to in the extra series. We also took an decision to take a controlling interest in a concert series called Epicenter which had a concert in California during the summer. Going on, we have sort of – we lost a little bit of money in that series, but based on what we have learnt and based on our numbers going forward, we believe that that series will effect at least breakeven or probably be profitable, so that will effectively reduce our sponsorship cost going forward. So we are looking at sort of tackling how we go forward with getting into and sort of owning certain key properties and with a view to try and sort of manage our costs on a longer-term basis. I think I have said over many calls over the years that as we continue to find more success in the extreme sports, the cost of sponsoring extreme sports, athletes, and series it continues go up every year. But disproportionately this year those two properties did affect our expense and our cost ratios.
Kaumil Gajrawala – UBS: Thank you. So as we look forward, there might be a little more bumpiness in the selling line depending on whether there is a new property involved or not?
Rodney Sacks: Yes, we are looking at one or two others, but we hope to be able to try and manage them a little better going forward, it’s – we are also going through a learning curve in these areas. We are also obviously as we continue to – the brand continues to gain traction and we continue to get listings in Europe, so the cost that we are incurring in establishing the brand in Europe will continue to settle down an be more normalized. Obviously, as you go into new countries you have that same issue when you have slightly higher startup costs or promotional costs as a percentage of sales because you got to start and get going. But we do think it probably will be a little less – have less impact going forward. Australia has been very good in that respect. There, we had a very good launch, and our numbers are showing good results as compared to the cost and hopefully we will be able to replicate that in new countries as we roll out further.
Kaumil Gajrawala – UBS: Great. And you mentioned Brazil, is that somewhere that you’ve already rollout or you are eventually rolling out?
Rodney Sacks: No, we have had a trial run in production and we – because of the taxes and the number of complications in importing finished products, we will be producing in, but also we have a planned rollout for later this year and for launch of the product, but anything conjunction with actual production in Brazil and so we’ve been – we’ve had certain delays in getting production going and getting our goods and ingredients cleared into Brazil, but we plan to start selling later this year.
Kaumil Gajrawala – UBS: Got it. Thank you.
Rodney Sacks: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Judy Hong. Your question please.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Thanks. Hi, Rodney.
Rodney Sacks: Hi, Judy.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Just in terms of the category growth improving in September, can you tell us what you think drove that improvement, and do you know if that improvement continued into October?
Rodney Sacks: We really – I can’t really give you more color on that. We’ve actually seen – we see a little bit of bumpiness still in our sales numbers out to distributors, in some cases, they are ordering too much. And the best indicator to us has been the actual sell-through rates. And we just got that couple of few days ago, so at this point we don’t have a bit of handle on that. We just know that it has – it does seem to be positive and we are encouraged by that.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Yes, it just seems a little bit counterintuitive to what we are hearing from other beverage companies in terms of the overall category still pretty soft and particularly in the premium priced product. So I am just surprised that that – I mean obviously this is one month of trend that you saw that improvement, and I was just wondering if that was a one-month phenomenon or it sort of continued into September.
Rodney Sacks: I know that there was a switch couple of months back by consumers to much more of the store brands and private label and cheaper brands. What we've been hearing is that consumers are more encouraged by the economy and that there was a earlier report out on Monday that consumers were seemed to be going back to brands and focusing on brands. But again, all we can say that everything that as I said earlier in the call, it has disproportionately affected our 24 ounce, so that pretty much is our higher priced product on a single serve. It’s at the – it’s in the $3 ring range as opposed to the $2 ring range for the 16 ounce and that’s why I indicated, in the period, our 16-ounce numbers were continuing to increase. So we are seeing – these numbers are small, but we are seeing positive signs for the Monster brand. We obviously have also been assisted by the new products that we've introduced, but ultimately they do often cannibalize other products, so I can’t give you the net effect of them, other than to say that overall we are seeing – the brand is up which is positive for us. But there are other brands as I indicated, a lot of them are down.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Yes. And then just in terms of Red Bull’s latest performance, it seems like that their share trend is getting a little bit better at least in the five week data that you provided. Anything to call out there in terms of what’s driving sort of sequential improvement on their brands?
Rodney Sacks: I don’t think so. I think that they’ve probably just had some focus on a couple of areas where they were weaker. They seem to be putting a lot more attention into those areas. They seem to be getting a little more traction in their 16 ounce can size at the expense of their (inaudible) ounce. They seem to be a little bit of a switch-up from 8 to 16 which is helping with their improvement because of the higher ring.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Okay.
Rodney Sacks: It doesn’t help on the units number, but on the ring, it does.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then just in terms of your comment about taking pricing down on the Hitman, can you just maybe elaborate a bit more in terms of what the rational behind that strategy is and –?
Rodney Sacks: What we saw initially was the pricing was very irrational in the shot category. Prices were going on reasonably consistent with the energy drink pricing on a case basis, but the retailers were taking a much larger margin on the shots and putting them on the shelf that up to $2.99 a little 2 ounce short. We have looked at. We have looked they’ve been pricing, that’s been the $2.49 to $2.99 in those areas and as where most of the pricing has settled down. But when you do look at that in relation to the pricing of energy drinks, you do see a disconnect. I mean the energy drink is going to give – we believe will give the consumer a boost and it’s a use occasion. And if it’s 8 ounce, it’s close – it’s priced close to $1.99 or 16 ounce is priced in the $2.29, $2.39 category. You're getting a big product in 16-ounces size can and you're paying 20%, 30% more for a little 2 ounce short. And so we just believe that there should be more rationality between a single use occasion with a shot which serves a particular purpose or function and a single can or a – of an energy drink which serves a – which is designed to serve a similar function. And so we think that if we can bring that pricing down and give a little more value to consumers, we think that might help. That’s the strategy. We are going to look at doing it and we will see how that works. We also have some other thoughts on how to address that category and how to work out a way to make inroads, because I think all the energy drink companies’ products have sort of – are all in the same sort of ballpark in that category. So we all got to find a way to break into that in a more meaningful way.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alec Patterson. Please go ahead.
Alec Patterson – Dresdner RCM Global Investors: Yes, hi. Rodney –
Rodney Sacks: Hi, Alec.
Alec Patterson – Dresdner RCM Global Investors: Hi. Just wanted to get a read, you mentioned how in the UK the ACV levels were improving and the relationship with CC there. But in terms of how you're sorting out the local operators' incentives between relentless and your product, can you give a sense of how you worked it out so that you know you are getting the same level of emphasis versus their own brand?
Rodney Sacks: We’ve had a lot of discussions with CC, the CC team in Great Britain on that. And we are clearly getting – we are showing them and explain them why we think there is a differentiation between the brands and what they – the different brand stand for. And that we have also sort of working through with them how they can persuade and justify to retailers why they would be better off having both brands and would broaden their consumer base because the brands we think do appeal to different consumers and we are all getting that. We are seeing that simply as a fact, we are seeing it in listings, we are seeing them starting to make presentations. In some cases, we are attending some of the presentation, the customer chain calls with them. We are getting listings in some of the smaller stores. We recently had a listing in some maybe 2000 stores. And so we are definitely improving our distribution levels. We also – they’ve put together a team of dedicated sales personnel. They’re all starting to share numbers with us, so we are knowing – getting to know what their team is selling, whereas before we didn’t know where their emphasis was. So we are able to give input on their team and make sure that we are getting a fair share of attention. We are looking at putting some of our own independent sales people into the field in the UK, we are working with CC now, we really didn’t have that as a sort of relationship before, but we have it. We were able to work together to make sure that we go to different retail outfits so we don’t end up stepping on each other’s toes. And we think that will help drive create demand in the small independent stores and the system in GB is most of those independents end up buying their products from the cash and carry wholesalers like Bookers and Bestway. And so once we can drive – create some demand at the store level then they will start picking up their purchases from the cash and carries and that’s a pretty extensive system that exists in Great Britain, so that’s the strategy we have. But we definitely are getting more listings. It’s probably premature we had a trial with a large group and our product did very well, it was selling at the same rate as relentless. And so we are hopeful we haven’t got the nod yet. But we are hopeful we will get a good listing there and our products are doing quite well in some of the other stores. In fact, it had been suggested that in – as the product hasn't been doing as well effect, as the contrary, we confirmed with, guys, that in fact the product is very well in (inaudible) and they are probably expanding the product’s footprint into more stores. So there are all challenges in different countries, but overall, we have picked up some nice market share and we are continuing to grow. We are actually seeing continued growth quarter-by-quarter and/or period-by-period in most of the European countries which is good for the brand, so – because it is at least sticking. And so we just are going to continue to focus on the plans. We do have plans to increase our numbers next year and we were pretty comfortable with that.
Alec Patterson – Dresdner RCM Global Investors: Okay, and great, I appreciate that. Do you have market share numbers for the UK or France? 
Rodney Sacks: I don’t have them here. I know that in the – I think in France, we have probably just over a 10% share now. It’s gone over 10% in most of the channels. But I don’t have the details of the exact channels or how much it is.
Alec Patterson – Dresdner RCM Global Investors: Okay. And then as you went through explaining some of the puts and takes going on at the operating profit level with the ventures, the extract, et cetera, A, are you going to be detailing that in the Q so we can at least understand what’s going on? And B, are all those items behind what happened in terms of the selling expense ratio jumping up year-over-year or did they all flow through that and we should expect that current ratio of north of 12% to kind of hold now going forward?
Rodney Sacks: I am really not sure I can give you information on that. It clearly, obviously comes into the – these items come into the expense line. And we don’t expect there to be that sort of impact going forward. It mainly hit the line in this third quarter, both Xtruck and Epicenter. But I am just not in a position to be more definite on how it’s likely to be going forward. We would think it’s coming down, but I really can’t give you that with any definity [ph].
Alec Patterson – Dresdner RCM Global Investors: Okay. All right, thank you, Rodney.
Rodney Sacks: Thanks Alec.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Greg Badishkanian. Please go ahead.
Geoff – Citigroup: This is Geoff [ph] on for Greg.
Rodney Sacks: Hi, Geoff.
Geoff – Citigroup: How are you doing? Can you talk about the promotional environment particularly this quarter and into September and October? Would you say it's gotten more or less promotional?
Rodney Sacks: More or less promotional, I am not sure.
Geoff – Citigroup: Just from a competitor standpoint.
Rodney Sacks: Competitive, it's been – it's pretty much the same. It has just been a question of where we – we are in a sort of position now where we are reviewing – changing certain directions in promotions and how to do promotions. The last quarter was in many ways it was a learning curve through Xtruck and Epicenter. There are one or two other opportunities that are evaluating that are different. But looking at it on the same on a similar basis to actually acquire a stake in the even or in the actual property so that we actually have an asset that we can leverage going forward, we can stabilize our costs and actually hopefully even grow some profit, there is some profit on it. But at this point, we are a little higher in our cost but – for the US but not much. It’s really is attributable to the Europe where we’ve had the higher costs. I don’t want to break them out at this point, but pretty much across the board, if you look at Europe that’s where we are ending up in with substantially higher costs and that needs us to normalize. When that normalizes, I think we will able to go get back to much closer to the historical levels.
Geoff – Citigroup: Okay. And then as you sort of think about 4Q margin, how do you think input costs might impact your margin in the quarter?
Rodney Sacks: I think we gave you some indication of the – from the cost side that we think it’s reasonably good. And so – sugar’s up a little bit, but we really do think we should be able to keep the margins in line. But again, we just don’t give guidance, so we just don’t get to a point where I am not sure of where we are going to end up and a lot of it will depend on the mix. The mix was a little bit less in the coffee. If we can do – if we think we can actually do some a little better in this quarter with newer products like import and Nitrous, which may help the margin, but again I really go back to the point that we really don’t want to give guidance and don’t give guidance on those numbers.
Geoff – Citigroup: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question comes from Mark Astrachan. Please go ahead.
Mark Astrachan – Stifel Nicolaus: Yes. Hi, good afternoon, guys.
Rodney Sacks: Hi, Mark.
Mark Astrachan – Stifel Nicolaus: I guess just first question on the promotional allowances line, could you talk in broad strokes about the leverage or kind of the reversal of leverage in that line and how important those are to driving growth. And basically, I know you can’t really answer this, but directionally if you didn’t see that increase in promotional spending or promotional allowances, do you think you still would have had pretty nice revenue growth. I mean is it really a necessary driver to the business?
Rodney Sacks: That’s the million dollar advertising question. You never know the answer to that question. On a personal level, I believe that a lot of the – well not lot, but certain of the properties in the promotional expenses we incurred did not have a direct relation on our revenues. I think a lot of them were very much more preparatory to the internationalization if I could describe it like that way of the brand. How much did the Jensen Button promotion, the fact that he won the world champion have on sales? He only won the world championship two weeks ago, so his picture is all over the paper with drinking Monster, wearing Monster hats in a very incredible setting. So what will that do to our sale directly in the UK, it may improve them in the fourth quarter, it’s probably nothing in the third quarter. But what’s more important is that the brand is credible, the brand is now well known in Brazil where they had the race. The brand is well known in – it helped the brand we think in Australia which has got off to a great start. We are planning obviously new launches expanding into additional countries in Europe next year, expanding from Brazil into additional countries, in South America, we are looking at the Asia, we don’t have any fixed plans yet. But those countries have – they have a lot of exposure to these international properties, the Formula One, the MotoGP, those are clearly going to benefit the brand on a longer-term basis and to help create awareness for the brand and ultimately pull when you go into those markets. But it’s really, really odd for me to say – and yes, on a short-term basis if we managed the company on a very short-term focus, we could probably pullback some of these things that we are doing. And in the short term, it probably wouldn’t make much difference or no difference to our sales. But we think it will make a difference in long term and we are trying to manage the brand for the long-term and so a certain percentage, not all of what we're doing, is designed to address the international growth expansion of the brand whereas other things are a design to current sales and keep the brand relevant and in the forefront of the mind of consumers.
Mark Astrachan – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, great. And then directionally speaking, if you go back a year ago and look at the contribution from some of the ancillary brands like Lost or Rumba, was that business what I would call meaningful a year ago and is part of the reason why you can say that your 16-ounce business is growing, but potentially you are seeing some pressures because you are laughing some of those businesses being bigger a year ago than they were this year.
Rodney Sacks: Not really, those brands have been non-core is one way of defining them for USA. They've really not had a real impact for some years on our numbers, on our sales, on our profits or anything. The – many years back there was an opportunity that might have come about with those brands and then maybe would have contributed to the bottom line a little bit. As the energy category evolved, it became – these brands became less and less important. We're sort of looking at these brands to try and test the market or test consumer response to different types of products. In the case of Lost, it’s pretty much the same as energy drinks, there is not a lot of point to – no real points of difference. In the case of the energy juice which is Rumba, there is – it is a non-carbonated 100% juice product, and we are looking at testing it and how to market it and seeing if there is an opportunity that might grow and develop. If we nurture it in that – and then open up a new category or sub category, the sales of that have been okay, but it’s not making a big difference either way. So we're looking at that and we're saying do we persist with it. We're reviewing it. But we're looking at information that we get to maybe tweak that into another direction. We are sort of – we are thinking about taking a juice product in another direction now and doing something different. But some of it's derived from information we received from Rumba. But they really are non-core and they don’t really effect the – the brand that’s – when I say 16-ounces increase, that is Monster and that is continuing to be strong and continuing to show positive increases.
Mark Astrachan – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. And if you think about just the 16-ounce Monster, was that up this quarter versus last quarter?
Rodney Sacks: I don’t – 16 ounce, I would be guessing. I don’t know. I will try and find that figure out for you now, but –
Mark Astrachan – Stifel Nicolaus: Well, but it was still up in the second quarter, right, year-on-year?
Rodney Sacks: To the best of my recollection it was.
Mark Astrachan – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay.
Rodney Sacks: Yes.
Mark Astrachan – Stifel Nicolaus: All right.
Rodney Sacks: I think we have seen 16 ounce in Monster decrease. I think it’s continued to improve. The softness has been in the 24 ounce and even a little bit in the 32-ounce package because of the higher ring and we think the problem particularly in the unemployment in blue-collar workers and that’s in been the problem. So generally we’ve continued to see Monster 16-ounce products continue. I think looking back to – my recollection is looking back at Nielsen numbers continually. We have always continued to show positive numbers on the 16 ounce.
Mark Astrachan – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. And just finally, just to go back to some of the numbers that you had touched on from the Xtruck series and there are some other things I missed in there. Could you just give us those again? There were some legal expenses in there, there were some other puts and takes.
Rodney Sacks: Yes, there was a recovery of legal expenses of about $4.7 million. There were costs in the three months attributable to Xtruck and the Epicenter Music Event of about $2.5 million. And then an operating loss net of about $0.7 million in relation to the European and Australian operations, that was slightly higher in Europe and there was a profit contribution from Australia. We just combined those two. And when you look at them, they're pretty close. They're immaterial, but they do certainly have an impact on the operating income line and that is why we addressed them for both the three and the six month – three and nine months. It was a small differential in the six – in the three months and there was a – pretty a zero effect from those on the operational income in the nine-month period.
Mark Astrachan – Stifel Nicolaus: Great, thank you.
Rodney Sacks: Sure. One of the things that I would like to allude to is just to mention that the tax rate for the period will be about 39.1% as compared to 37.5% for the same period last year. This increase was primarily attributable to a decrease in non-taxable interest income from certain investments and a decrease in tax benefits attributable to operations in certain tax jurisdictions having lower tax rates. I just wanted to make that, because that's – you can see there is the differential in the operating income line and the net income line. So the increase in – just to go back, answer an earlier question, sorry, the 16.2-ounce, yes, that has been positive both the second and the third quarter over prior year. Just to confirm that. We are at a planning time at the moment. We really are planning to have a reasonably large push to expand our international distribution on different continents. We are engaged in a lot of discussions on – in that respects that will be our ongoing focus early next year. We hope we are able to announce a meaningful relationship in the near future in that regard and probably hopefully before we have the shareholder update in the middle of December. At this point, we are planning on continuing to implement our share repurchase scheme this quarter. And thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may now all disconnect.

===== 2009 Q2  (2009-08-06 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Rodney Sacks - Chairman and CEO Hilton Schlosberg - Vice Chairman and President Tom Kelly - VP, Finance
Analysts: Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Jeff Hans - Citi Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Hansen Natural Corporation Second Quarter 2009 Financial Results Conference Call. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode and following the presentation the conference will be opened for questions. (Operator Instructions).This conference is being recorded today Thursday, August 6th of 2009. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you for attending this call. My name is Rodney Sacks; Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, he is with me today as is, Tom Kelly, our Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I’d like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on management’s current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made herein. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed on March 2, 2009, and our most recent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, including the sections contained therein entitled risk factors and forward-looking statements for discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measures of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated August 6, 2009. A copy of this information is also available on our website at www.hansens.com in the Investor Relations section. As indicated by me on recent conference calls and at the shareholder meeting the beverage markets throughout the world in general and in the United States in particular has shown and continues to show softness. Coca-Cola and Pepsi recently reported drops in North American retail volumes. Although we have seen positive signs, in the US economy the housing market is still suffering from record foreclosures and the absence of new building activities, job losses continue to hamper the spending power of US consumers which we believe disproportionately affects our consumers discretionary spending. Accordingly to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through June 27, 2009, all outlets combined namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers excluding Wal-Mart. Sales in the energy drink declined 1.7% versus a year ago. According to the Nielsen reports sales of Monster grew 0.9% in the 13 week period concerned while sales of Monster’s main competitor Red Bull decreased by 2.2%. Accordingly to the Nielsen reports sales of Rockstar dropped 8.4% and sales of Amp dropped 8.6% so though Amp had been increasing but appear to have stumbled. In actual dollar volume, the energy drink category sale decreased by a total of 21.2 million in the 13 week period concerned. Sales of Monster however increased by 3.2 million as compared to sales of Red Bull which decreased 9.4 million. Sales of Rockstar were decreased by 11.6 million and sales of Amp was decreased by 8.3 million. Sales of Full Throttle decreased by 6.9 million. One of the few brands to have increased in sales was NOS, its sales increased by 10.9 million. According to Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks concerned all outlets combined Monster’s market share increased by 0.8 points to 28.4 while Red Bull’s markets share dropped 0.2 points to 35. Rockstar’s market share was down 0.8 points to 10.7; Amp’s market share was down 0.6 points to 7.3. Full throttle’s market share dropped 0.5 points to 4.3 and NOS’s share increased one point to 3.6. These figures exclude the emerging energy shot category which is reported separately. If the energy drink and energy shot categories were combined. The overall category would have grown 3.2% in the 13 week period concerned. According to Nielsen, sales of Java Monster represented approximately 13.4% of the sales of the Monster brand over the 13 weeks through June 27. The decrease in the percentage of our sales represented by Java Monster contributed to the increase in gross margin achieved by us during the quarter. While sales of Java Monster were lower in the previous year -- than in the previous year, the decline is primarily attributable to Starbucks entering the category in the middle of the second quarter of 2008. With its new line of DoubleShot energy plus coffee drinks in 16 ounce cans is direct competition with Java Monster. In the 13 weeks ended June 27, 2009 sales in the energy plus coffee category all outlets combined, excluding Wal-Mart increased 38% to 89.3 million over the comparable period last year. Consequently while sales of the energy plus coffee drinks category are higher than last year, the category is being split between more major participants. Sales of Starbucks DoubleShot energy plus coffee drinks in the 13 weeks period concerned amounted to 29.8 million as compared to sale of Java Monster at the same period which amounted to 45.2. Consequently Java Monster is out selling Starbucks coffee plus energy products by a large margin. Sales of our other competitor's products namely Rockstar Roasted and Full Throttle coffee drinks also substantially lower. According to Nielsen for the five weeks ended June 27, 2009 sales in the convenience and gas channel decreased by 3.5% versus the same period last year. During the five weeks period concerned Red Bull sales decreased by 2.8% versus the same period last year while Monster sales decreased 5.6% versus the same period last year. Rockstar was down 11.2%. Amp was down 16.3%, Full Throttle was down 8% while [NOS's] rate increased flow to 25.6%. Monster share of the convenience and gas channel has increased continuously in each of the four/five week periods from 28% at the beginning of this year to 29.6% during the five week period ended June 27, 2009. Red Bull share is up slightly from 33.8% beginning of the year to 34.4, while Rockstar share decreased from 11% to 10.2 and Amp’s share decreased from 7.5 to 7.1 from the beginning of the year. Despite the extensive marketing programs and support provided by Pepsi, the Amp’s brand appears to [have plateaued] and continues to loose market share. In the five week period ending June 27, 2009 sales in the grocery channel were down 2%. Monster sales in this channel were up 6.6%, while Red Bull sales were flat and Rockstar's sales were down 11.4%. Amp’s sales were also lower by 23.6%, while Full Throttle sales were down 10.9%, NOS's sales were up 25.2%. Since the beginning of the year, Red Bull's market share in this channel has decreased from 38.8% to 37.2%. Monster share is up from 22.1% to 24.5%, Rockstar's share decreased from 13% to 12.4%, Amp’s share increased from 7.2 to 6.9 while Full Throttle share has remained flat to 3.5 and NOS's share increased from 1.9 to 2.2. I am pleased to report that our market share in Florida has improved in both the convenience and grocery channels and is now higher than what it was prior to the transition to the current system. Atlanta is also improving, Monster's market share is now higher in grocery and that is returned to pre-transition levels in convenience. Although CCE has made substantial progress in Dallas, we are not quite back to the pre-transition share levels once the share in San Antonio is higher now than it was before the transition in both convenience and grocery. In Houston, our market share in grocery has improved and is higher than it was before the transition. However, our market share in the convenience channel in Houston is lower. Houston is a large independent market and also -- and this has also contributed to the decline in our market share in Houston. Interestingly one of the other markets in which our market share has dropped is Detroit which is also a large independent market although we are still the leading energy drink in that market. The transition to certain of the new AB Distributors has also had its challenges. We have addressed and are continuing to address those markets in which we have lost market share. Nationally, we have gained market share. Since the transition in November of last year, Monster's market share in the convenience and grocery channels nationally has increased to 29.6% and 24.5% respectively from 28.7% and 23%. We believe that we will continue to benefit from our alignment with the two strongest distribution systems in the United States. We continue to see improvements in sales and gains in market share in Canada. In the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 13 weeks ended July 4, 2009 despite sales of energy drinks being down 3% overall, Monster’s market share has increased by 4.2 points over the same period last year to 18%, while Red Bull share increased by 1.4 points to 38.8%. Rockstar's market share decreased by 2.3 points to 11.5%. Progress is being made across Canada by the code system. Sales in Mexico also continue to be satisfactory. Sales are progressing well in continental Europe and although we were off to a slower start in the United Kingdom, distribution level of sales they have continued to improve. We are continuing to work with CCE in the United Kingdom to improve distribution levels and sales during the second half of the year. We are engaged in discussions with new potential distributor for Ireland. Sales of Monster energy commenced in Australia last week with Schweppes Australia Pty Ltd. Initial response from both customers as well as consumers in Australia has been positive and we are excited about the prospect for the Monster brand in Australia. We are continuing with our plans to produce and launch Monster in Brazil later this year. For the three months ended June the 30th, 2009, sales through retail grocery specialty chains and wholesalers represented 6.6% of gross sales, down from 7.2% last year. Sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 12.1% of sales down from 14.2% in the previous year. Sales to full service distributors represented 67.4% of sales, down from 67.8% in the same period last year. Other sales were flat at 2.6%. Sales outside the US increased to 11.4% from 8.2% in the same period last year. Gross sales to customers outside the US amounted to 39.4 million compared to 27 million in the same quarter last year. Sales to Monster Energy in the United Kingdom and Europe were promising. Included in such sales are direct sales to the company's military customers that we deliver to such customers in the US. In periods prior to the third quarter of 2008, sales to these customers were classified as domestic sales due to the fact that the products we delivered to such customers in the US Since that quarter, sales to these customers have been classified as outside of the US, because the company recognized that products sold to such customers were in fact being transshipped to the military and their customers overseas, and were therefore included in the classification of sales to customers outside of the US during the periods concerned. As a result, 2nd quarter 2008 comparative figures had been adjusted by 7.5 million from the amounts previously reported. We believe that we will continue to benefit from reductions in the cost of certain raw materials including certain containers and packaging materials as well as juice concentrates, particularly apple juice concentrate although we had have started to see hardening in the process of aluminum. We are continuing to expand the distribution of Vidration enhanced water drinks through our distributors and are also continuing with the rollout of the Monster Hitman Line of Energy Shooters in three-ounce containers. Although Monster's market share of the energy shot market is relatively small, we are ahead of Amp’s, NOS, Rockstar and Full Throttle energy shots and our share is continuing to grow. Red Bull recently entered the energy shot category with a two-ounce energy shot. Of the new product introduced by the recently in the gross sale in the second quarter of Monster import which is a 550 ml of 18.6-ounce resealable can and is manufactured in Europe and imported into the United States in a month to approximately 3.3 million. While sales of X-Presso Monster and new non-carbonated diary-based espresso energy drink which was launched early -- shortly before the end of the second quarter with minimal. Sales of unused Nitrous Monster Energy line of carbonated energy drinks which are packaged in resealable 12-ounce sleek can and come in three versions, Extra Dry, Anti Gravity and Killer-B commenced in the third quarter. Package in the Monster range that has been hit hardest by the economic downturn is up 24-ounce size package which is consistent with our belief that the weak economy has disproportionately affected blue-collar workers who make up a large portion of our consumer base and to all the principle purchasers of our 24-ounce size packages. In this regard I will point out that sales of Monster Energy in 16-ounce size cans in the United States increased in the second quarter of 2009 over the same period last year, while sales of Monster Energy in 24-ounce size cans in United States decreased from the same period last year. We are currently preparing for the launch of a number of products sweetened with Stevia for the Hansen and Blue Sky brand lines. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to 283.3 million compared to 256.8 million at the end of December 2008. Short-term investments were 30.8 million compared to 29.1 million at the end of December 2008. Investments primarily auction rate securities decreased from 89.6 million to 87.9 million. Trade accounts receivables increased to 101.9 million from 45.2 million at the end of December and distribution agreement receivables decreased to 24 million from 19.7 million at December 31, 2008. Days outstanding for receivables was 30.5 days at June 30, 2009, compared to 16.9 days at December 31, 2008, 36.9 days at the end of March, 2009 and 28.4 days at June 30, 2008. Inventories increased to 117.3 million from a 116.3 million at December 31, 2008. Average days of inventory were 76 days at June 30, 2009 lower than the 90 days of inventory at December 31, 2008 and the 86.7 days at the end of March, 2009. Now, 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, we've provide a certain financial information regarding terminated and new distribution agreements. We explained the impact of the termination payments made to terminated distributors to the income statement, i.e. the full amount was expensed in 2008 including those distributors where we commenced distribution in 2009 in Mexico and Canada. We also explained that while we received non-refundable contributions from newly appointed distributors which covered a significant portion of the costs of terminating certain distributors. Such contributions are accounted for as deferred revenue. Such deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue right to be over the anticipated 20 year life of the distribution agreements. Deferred revenue recognized was 1.8 million in the quarter compared to 0.5 million in the comparable financial period last year. This explains the accounting treatment relating to the above from a cash flow point of view, the above described transactions are expected to remain largely neutral to the company as we anticipated that we would receive payments for the contributions that approximate the payments to be made by us to terminated distributors. For the 2009 second quarter we recorded 0.7 million in termination obligations to prior distributors. Termination obligations were minimal in the second quarter of 2008. During the three months ended June 30, 2009 the company redeemed 1.5. million of its auction rate securities [at par]. At June 30, 2009 the company held auction rate securities with a face value of 100.5 million, 102 million at March 31, 2009 and 112.5 million at December 31, 2008. The company determined that a cumulative impairment of 12.3 million had occurred at June 30, 2009. It was 15.5 million as of March 31, 2009 and 14.9 million as of December 31, 2008. Of which 8.3 million was deemed temporary and 4 million was deemed other than temporary. As a result; included as a commencement of other comprehensive loss is 5 million net of taxes as of June 30 2009. No other than temporary impairment charges were recorded for the third months ending June 30, 2009. Included in other income expense other than temporary impairment of 3.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009, the auction rate securities will continue to accrue interest at contractual rates until the respective auctions succeed or they are redeemed. During the second quarter, the company did not repurchase any shares of common stock. The unaudited, unadjusted gross sales in July 2009 were approximately 127.1 million, up approximately 13.6% over July 2008. Unaudited, unadjusted gross sales of the Monster sales brand including Java Monster and Hitman were approximately 17.5% higher than last year including the UK and Australia. As I have indicated in the past, these are unaudited, unadjusted gross sales figures and we have take the decision to discontinue our practice of providing such unaudited, unadjusted gross sales figures for the first month of the current quarter starting with the third quarter. I would like to open the floor to questions. Thank you.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Judy Hong : If I look at your sales growth in the quarter and if I back out International, US looks like it was up about two to 3%? Is that math correct?
 Goldman Sachs: If I look at your sales growth in the quarter and if I back out International, US looks like it was up about two to 3%? Is that math correct?
Rodney Sacks: I would have a look. I don't know. Off my head, we will get that figure.
Judy Hong : The 17.5% improvement that you saw in July, how much was that International versus US also?
 Goldman Sachs: The 17.5% improvement that you saw in July, how much was that International versus US also?
Rodney Sacks: I don't have the break-up of those figures. We will try and get them to you before the end of the call.
Judy Hong : As you think about the category trends, obviously it looks like the shots category has had some impact. What is -- your view of how sustainable the shots category itself is? Is this more trial? Are the consumers really migrating from traditional energy drinks into shots and why is Monster Hitman not a bigger brand in that category?
 Goldman Sachs: As you think about the category trends, obviously it looks like the shots category has had some impact. What is -- your view of how sustainable the shots category itself is? Is this more trial? Are the consumers really migrating from traditional energy drinks into shots and why is Monster Hitman not a bigger brand in that category?
Rodney Sacks: I really don't know what the prospects or the longevity for the shot category are. We do know that the leader of the category, we believe has developed a strong lead in the category but has both the brand we would believe largely on unsustainable facts and representations as to the brands attributes and performance. We don't believe that they are -- that they are able to substantiate -- that the brand provides energy for five hours as the name indicates. We also don't believe that there is a credible crash concept that they -- simply a figment of their own invention. Of their imaginations as to what a crash is, but they have spent a lot of money representing that their product has this miraculousability to deliver five hours of energy despite the fact that it has no calories and no sugars in it. It also doesn't result or deliver a crash as opposed to all energy drinks and all energy contain sugar which is clearly factually untruthful because there are low carb and sugar free versions of energy drink on the market. That all energy drinks produced a crash where -- which again we believe is again an untruthful and misrepresentative statement.  We believe that brand has really gotten ahead based on the fact that it's based on a deception and untruthful statements. That really is quite -- we think important because we believe that consumers have been misled and duped into the believing that they do get this energy boost -- this extraordinary boost from that product as opposed to energy drinks and so, that does complicate the issue as to what is a sustainability of that category as they have the lion share of that category. We think that that is one of the major reasons why all -- most of the energy drinks have found it difficult to compete in that category and really inroads just because they've been a large major marketing and promoting their brands with one hand tied, so to speak tied behind their back, because they haven’t gone out and made this misrepresentations that the leader in the category has.  Again we just don't know when those facts really become more -- ingrained in consumer's mind what will the consumer do, will the consumer divide the tension amongst the other players in the category, will it go back to energy drink. We think there has been some -- basically some sales diverted from the energy category and that's why in the report, I do refer to the fact that the energy category as we defined it has -- is slightly negative. We think that if you combine it with the shot category which has taken some of the energy consumers over that category, it's still up -- it's continuing to grow. We believe that ultimately, we think there will be a migration of some of the users back to energy drinks or that the energy shots from the energy drink players which have credibility will continue to make inroads in that category. As you have Red Bull that’s now entering that category –[we are in the queue]; we believe that with time we will obviously be able to increase our presence. We are hopeful we will increase our presence in that and our percentage share of that category, so therefore it's really very uncertain as to where things will turn out in the end in that category, Judy.
Judy Hong : Secondly just in terms of your international market, I mean obviously you are getting a pretty good list in terms of sales as you are entering these new market. Can you give us the color in terms of what you are seeing at the consumer level and sort of assess the [brand holds] the trial. The repeats -- 
 Goldman Sachs: Secondly just in terms of your international market, I mean obviously you are getting a pretty good list in terms of sales as you are entering these new market. Can you give us the color in terms of what you are seeing at the consumer level and sort of assess the [brand holds] the trial. The repeats -- 
Rodney Sacks: Are you talking -- are you referring to international?
Judy Hong : Yes, International.
 Goldman Sachs: Yes, International.
Rodney Sacks: International, we think we have been getting some good growth. We are sort of getting in to markets that have been established for many years and we are competing against the current brands. In most of the markets in which we've entered we've pretty quickly become the number two brand. We've overtaken almost all the competitors in all the markets other than the UK where Relentless has quite a strong footing. We've had some issues and challenges in obviously in working through the -- with the CCE system which also the Relentless brand in that one market. In the other markets we've pretty much overtaken all of the competitors to Red Bull pretty quickly and we are the number two brand in France, in Belgium, in Holland, in Sweden, et cetera. We have as I indicated -- we are a little bit disappointed with our distributor in Ireland and we are taking steps to address that, so that has its own issues. We think we are off to a good start but it’s too early to tell how we will do in Spain.  So the sales are continuing to sell through which is really a repeat. We are continuing to maintain and slowly increase our market share, so, we think those markets are good and we will continue to grow in those markets as we develop because our brand is very young there.  The launch in Australia we were very encouraged by I mean got good distribution, we are hearing very anecdotally that -- very good sell through but it’s very isolated and in it's very early days and -- but we think that the Australian consumer does relate to our type of product and the marketing and they're are an outdoor, very sporting orientated society, so, we believe all of the sports that we have whether it is surfing, skating, skateboarding, BMX riding, motorcycle and motor racing all play well in Australia.  It’s a highly competitive market where you've got the leading player is actually "V" which is ahead of Red Bull. There has been a brand called [Milo] which is the Coke brand that’s been unsuccessful on our number of launches. They re-launched it in a large format literally trying to pretty much play of our brand marketing and positioning and it sort of seemed to be pulling, so we've got quite a bit of pull in the re-launch but we've actually started to make quite aggressive inroads against that brand at the offset in our launch. We believe that while it is a market that has been split between three players. Rockstar is a very, very weak player in that market. We believe we will be able to succeed and become a recognizable brand in Australia. In South Africa, the brand is also continuing to do well. Distributor is smaller there and so slowly we are continuing to make inroads there as well, so overall the brand is translating very well overseas and it is taking time -- as we've indicated the brand is doing well in Canada. It's quite clear by far number two brand in there. We are working through transitional issues with our new distributor in Mexico, but the brand is also up nicely on last year, so we are continuing to grow in all of these areas including Central America, so, that's -- obviously the -- with everything else the North American market has been a little more challenging, but International has been positive. We just (inaudible) going to give you the numbers for you the answer to your earlier question, Judy.
Judy Hong : Yes.
 Goldman Sachs: Yes.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citi. Please go ahead.
Jeff Hans - Citi: This is Jeff Hans actually on for Greg. You guys had a nice margin against this quarter. As we look at for the back half of the year what type of run rate that -- I know I think in the first quarter you mentioned comps are getting a little more difficult but are commodities a little bit lower than you had thought at that point or what can we kind of look out for? 
Rodney Sacks: Sorry can you repeat that question?
Jeff Hans - Citi: Sure. Just in terms of margins and kind of the run rate going forward, I know in 1Q you guys had mentioned that your comps are getting little bit more difficult in terms of margins but -- commodities are a little bit lower than you maybe had expected at that point. Just want to get a sense of what we can expect for the back half?
Rodney Sacks: I think commodities have been lower and so, we have been able to basically -- to buy in commodities reasonably well. We really don’t -- we don’t know how it will go -- going forward there has been some firming of some process like (inaudible). We bought some of the [main] side. I don’t want to give any indication of where we'll be and we are just not – [it is fact] is not to give that forecast, but -- one of the principal reasons we've had the increased margin, we've been able to sustain this -- clearly we have had some benefits on the cost side and we've also had some benefits on our product mix. That really, those have been the drivers historically. At this stage we know they may well be -- similar to how we got forward. We certainly -- I just don't want to get drawn into any forecast of where we are going to or where we are likely to be going forward on our margins. As you can see, we actually had some margin improvement from both of those areas. Just to get back to Judy's question. We were -- on domestic we were actually up about 4%, closer to -- roughly the 4% mark in North America and in the July numbers, again they are very, very rough numbers, Judy. We are up just under 7% in the US, so those are the numbers. There is a sort of split between US and International.
Jeff Hans - Citi: Then, actually Rodney, what was the total number in July, if you have that?
Rodney Sacks: What do you mean the total number?
Jeff Hans - Citi: The total sales number. I think you said up seven in the US?
Rodney Sacks: I gave you the same -- I gave you the number. The total -- the total number in July was about 127.1 million that’s the unaudited, but that’s unadjusted gross, not the gross we normally report which has some adjustments in it.
Jeff Hans - Citi: Got you.
Rodney Sacks: This is a raw number 127. What we are saying is that in that number, roughly -- say just under 7% was the domestic increase in sales, domestic in the US.
Jeff Hans - Citi: Just one quick one. I know you guys recently announced the partnership with CKE Restaurants. Do you feel the restaurant channel is something that you may continue expanding into forward? I know there has been some speculation that you were talking to McDonald's or McDonald's may consider the Monster brand. Is that a challenge you may really focus on going forward?
Rodney Sacks: Yes, [I can't say] -- because I don't know where the talk came from about McDonald's that was talk. Clearly, we see the food channel as an opportunity. It's a little more difficult because most of the fast food outlets really make their money and have some very big margins on the their fountain business and that's very much not a finished product business. That’s a model as you know, so, there are lot of logistical challenges, margin challenges and issues that we face in going into and getting additional distribution in the food channel. We believe as an energy drink we shouldn't be in the fountain business, we don’t think that does the brand and the image of the brand any good. We obviously don't want to do that, so, we are obviously looking at the channel as an opportunity to expand into additional outlets for additional sales. There is a lot of additional channels available to us in the US that we really haven't yet touched or if we've touched it we've hardly scratched the surface of them in the US and those are opportunities that we will continue to focus on just as an ongoing business, but clearly the cause relationship is a good relationship.  We think that's a very good -- particularly because of the positioning we think that's a great chain to be associated with. We think that gives us good sampling and its incremental because those are sales that wouldn’t have got anyway, it would have gone to a fountain drink and so obviously we are looking to -- basically be able to secure additional business in those channels going forward. I don't want to say any more at this point about them. We have made some inroads into the nontraditional channels; we've been sold in a number of Home Depots now. We've managed to secure distribution in Disneyland and Disney World which we think is a premium account. We're also been able to go into and getting to the nontraditional channels in not all of the country because of the different distribution systems we have but in many parts of the country in chains like Best Buy and Blockbuster Video which as we continue to go up these are channels that we will continue to focus on and see if there are additional volume opportunities in these channels as we go forward.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Question on just kind of how to think about some housekeeping things in the quarter. You touched on some of the new products and benefit you said import was about 3.3 million. What was Hitman's contribution to sales in the quarter?
Rodney Sacks: These -- we given these numbers -- initially we gave these numbers when we just first sort of launched the product going forward same as we did with the import just to say where we are with it but going forward we don’t want to -- as a policy we are not going to break out, continue to break out all these sub categories in the Monster brand.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Is it fair to say that the Hitman's contribution was similar to what we've seen in previous quarters?
Rodney Sacks: I don't know, I haven’t focused on the number. I don’t have it available to me now Mark and I just -- we just are not going to [and look to] where it because we usually get started to macro manage the Monster brand which we're just not going to do.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: What about International. Can you talk about that a little bit in terms of what selling in terms of getting into your new distributors international? Can you talk about that a little bit in terms of what selling; in terms of getting into your new distributor was versus what the actual the sales contribution was, if you talk about that?
Rodney Sacks: No, we've given you the International figure and we are just not going to break it down further at this point. As we go further, we establish ourselves in different continents it might be something we look at -- later breaking it down in more detail. Really we are just not going to do that. It becomes micromanaging there are [different continents]. There are sales, there is pipeline full in the initial full to new distributors then they sell in the market. It just becomes long explanations for each and every country, each and every area definitely which becomes too complicated and it’s just something we think that isn’t appropriate to go into, so as a company we're just not going to -- not going to that sort of detail. 
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Then let's try it like this. Can you talk a little bit about?
Rodney Sacks: Any way you want.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Well, we will ask a more broad question then, so, if you just think about what the sales look like in terms of the difference between what you see in the scanner data in the US which is obviously the your biggest market and what you are reporting that includes the strong results in July. I guess I am just trying to get a sense of what the difference is between -- kind of how the business is humming along at a stronger rate on the top line versus what we are seeing in terms of just limited channels. Is it the unmarked channels the club store, the Wall Mart, incremental distribution in Europe I mean what is really contributing through this outside growth versus what we are seeing in new track channels?
Rodney Sacks: Well I think you've got the first factor is you have different growth trends in the USA versus Europe even versus in Canada and Mexico. You are at different stages of the development, so it really is, it very to say what are the stages because you've got UK which is very different to France which is very different to Australia. I mean it’s all over the map. What I can say is that the very market generally experienced quite a lot of softness and that’s I think something that was commonly felt by most of the people we've talked to -- many of the people we've talked to -- that in the end of May early June the beverage market generally in the US somehow was soft and not sure anybody really knew why? And it sort of started to pick up towards the end of June. That was something that was commented on by industry experts guys like Mark (inaudible) everybody was sort of not sure why that was and we feel we have seen a some sort of a more positive sign later in June going into July.  Europe is sort of just very different because we are at unusual stages. I mean we've got product going into as you know when launching this product obviously you're selling into your distributor. He is selling into the market. You are getting pipeline full, you are getting a trial. We just -- it’s too early a stage to really know. We don’t have enough information quite frankly from our own distributors to really -- have a really serious handle on each country and some of these statistics. We do know that our market share in the countries in which we've got into hasn’t really dropped substantially or at all since we launched and we continue to make, keep, retain market share increase, so we've been very encouraged by that fact on sell through. But it is very early and I can't really give you more color on it. Other than we are pretty happy with where we are in Europe. I think its all going well to been able to overtake brands that have been there for years and years already within months. I think it’s a great achievement, so we are happy, but our market share in Europe is obviously still substantially lower than our market share in the US. As you can see in Canada, we are now up in the very high teens from being in the very low teens couple of months back. We are in the mid 20s in the Mexico, so our market share is different, but it is making inroads and the brand is obviously pulling and clearly we think sustainable in these other countries.  The US is the -- United States as I said had its softness, it's a much more mature market, but it is starting to -- we are seeing some signs of improvement end of June, early July and whether that's consistent with the economy, we don't know. I am not an economist and we don't know where the economy is going to go, but it has been little stronger but not sufficiently strong for us to really perceive any real trend.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Finally on the promotional allowances it seems like that went up a little bit sequentially versus the first quarter and I think directionally different than what it was expected. What was kind of going on in that number that as it led to the increase versus what we have seen?
Rodney Sacks: I just think some of the chain accounts seem to have, some of the -- the annual programs just seem to have hit little higher in this quarter than the first quarter. We did sign some programs, we did few things that were sort of hadn't been budgeted for things like Jenson Button sponsorship, that's the formula one driver who was head of the championship. We had a unique opportunity right as the season -- season started to get a sponsorship with him for the rest of the season and he was heading the -- still is heading the world championship. He hasn't won the last couple of races, but we've got enormous exposure overseas and around the world because Formula 1 is probably the premium motor sport internationally. These are the things that we decided to get in to -- on an ad hoc basis. I just don’t know that what else was happening -- we did some coupon programs with Java Monster in the period which we were probably a little higher. On the other hand we also went into a program which is -- we've taken the share of -- basically off road truck racing series and we are involved in the series which is again its another strategy we have on some of our marketing to be able to basically turn the control ongoing participation and costs in marketing in the series and so we're still just sponsoring the drivers in the series. This is the -- tracks is of (inaudible) which is been race at the moment and is being shown on TV, so, we have a stake in the actual series now and so that cost came into the second quarter, so that was one of the other costs that was higher that hadn’t been probably budgeted for initially in the first early part of the year to something we only -- decided to go into the opportunity arose during the course of the year.
Operator: That concludes our time for today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Sacks for any closing comments at this time. 
Rodney Sacks: We have been seen a lot of tough times in the beverage industry in the last -- for this year. As we said that we have seen sort of some signs of better -- our sales seemed to be better going into July. We have new products that we are really -- only really now getting into the force of getting out into the market, so, they really had no real impact in the second quarter. We are hopeful they will have some impact for us going forward. As with all new products, you don't know what they are -- how they are going to turn out. We are very hopeful for them. We've also -- to help us expand and also manage our business more closely, we've taken on a new Chief Operating Officer for the Monster brand, Nick Gagliardi who has come with a lot of industry experience both from consumer product side and from managing from a -- a brand in the beer industry from the brand starts from the best and he got also lot of experience in managing and running, operating actual distributorships.  So, we think he got a lot of good round of experience and he is going to be a great asset to the business and to helping us manage the brand going forward. We are starting to see some good results in the non-traditional beverage categories. As of indicated the Home Depots, Best Buys, Carl's Jr. and we think that those are also going to be positive. In the UK, we've been very fortunate to have been able to tied up a long-term supply -- exclusive supply arrangement with Wetherspoon which is one of the largest on-premise pub operators in the UK, certainly in sales and volume they are one of the most aggressive, so, this is pretty much the -- I would the premiere on-premise chain account we could have got in the UK. We've managed to secure that from Red Bull and we have that going forward for some years. We think that's going to be a very important account for us as just -- as an indicator for the on-premise channel in the UK and also for sampling and exposure and image in the UK market as we continue to getting to the market and secure additional distribution and we think sales volumes. So we think we do have some positive things going on, going for the brand going forward and for the company. We all looking forward to a positive second half of the year. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Hansen Natural Corporation second quarter 2009 financial result conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2008 Q4  (2009-02-26 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Rodney Sacks - Chairman and CEO Hilton Schlosberg - Vice Chairman and President Tom Kelly - Vice President, Finance
Analysts: Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Alton Stump - Longbow Research Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus Scott Van Winkle - Canaccord Adams
Operator: Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Hansen Natural Corporation, fourth quarter 2008 financial results conference call. During today's presentation all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be opened for questions. (Operator’s Instructions) This conference call is being recorded today Thursday, February 26, 2009. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead sir.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. My name is Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is with me today as is Tom Kelly, our Vice President of Finance. Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management, with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on management's current knowledge and expectations and of subject to certain risks and uncertainties many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made herein. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed on February 29, 2008 and our most recent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, including the sections contained therein entitled "Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements" for discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. We also refer listeners to our Form 10-K to be filed no later than Monday, March 2, 2009. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measures of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the consolidated or dense consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated February 26, 2009. A copy of this information is also available on our website www.hansens.com in the investor relations section. The beverage industry has continued to slowdown consistent with the slowdown in the weak US economy. The housing market declines, increasing job losses and lowering company profits all of which continue to hamper the spending power of US consumers, who we believe have cutback on impulse purchases and much of their discretionary spending. The good news is that the energy drink category continues to remain one of the few sectors in the beverage industry that continues to show year-on-year growth, rather a slower rate than previously. While this trend continues to be more marked in California, which is one of the largest energy drink markets, it is, nevertheless, a nation wide trend. We continue to believe that this trend disproportionately affects blue-collar workers who make up a large portion of our consumer base. While lower gas prices are being seen at the pumps, we have not seen any real turn-around in purchases at gas stations, which is an important sector for energy drinks. We believe that it will be sometime before the effects of the recent stimulus package can be assessed. During the last quarter we transitioned a large portion of our distributor system to Coca-Cola bottlers as well as new Anheuser-Busch distributors, which has anticipated resulted in the certain amount of disruption. I will discuss the transition in more detail later in the call. As expected, we experienced some disruption in our supply chain but the Monster Energy brand continues to grow in the excess of the growth in the energy drink category. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13-weeks through January 24, 2009, all outlets combined namely the convenience, grocery, drug, and mass excluding Wal-Mart, the energy drink category grew 8%, while Monster grew 13.6%. In actual dollar volume the energy drink category increased in sales by a total of $81.3 million to $1.099 billion for the 13-week period concerned. Of the increase $36 million was contributed by increased sales of Monster; sales of Red Bull, Rockstar and NOS increased by $5.4 million, $7.4 million, $31.5 million and $14.8 million respectively. Sales of: Full Throttle, No Fear and Adrenaline Rush decreased by $13 million, $7.5 million and $7.6 million respectively. According to the Nielsen, all outlets combined: Monster's market share was up 1.3 points to 27.3, Red Bull’s market share drops 2.2 points to 4.7. Rockstar's market share was down is 0.2 points to 11.3, Amp's market share was up 2.5 points to 7.6%, Full Throttle's market share dropped to 4.5% while NOS' market share increased to 3.1%, Monster sales increased by 13.6% in the period, and Red Bull sales early increased by 1.4%. According to Nielson sales of Java Monster, it represented approximately 15% of the sales of Monster brand over the period concerned. Sales of Java Monster to customers in the fourth quarter, that is our sales out to customers, represented approximately 10.9% of the Monster Energy brand sales in the US excluding shocks in the quarter. For the three months ended December 31, 2008, sales to retail grocery specialty chains and wholesalers represented 7% of the gross sales, which was down from 8% in the previous year. Sales to club stores, drug chains, and mass merchandisers represented 14% of sales, which was up from 11% in the previous year. Sales to full service distributors represented 75% of sales, down from 77% last year. And sales to health food distributors was flat at 1%, while sales to military and others were flat at 3%. For the year ended December 31, 2008, full year, gross sales to retail grocery was flat with last year at 8%. Sales to club stores, drug and mass were also flat at 14 and sales to full service distributors represented 74% of sales compared to 73% previous year, while sales to health food distributors decreased from 2% to 1% and sales to military and others was flat at 3%. For the three months ended December 31, 2008, gross sales outside of California increased to 78% from 75.2% while for the year, gross sales outside of California represented 77.2%, up from 73% last year. Gross sales to customers outside of the US amounted to $16.9 million, compared to $15.3 million in the same quarter last year, and represented approximately 6.1% of gross sales up from 5.5% in the same period last year. Gross sales to customers outside of the US, for the year ended December 31, 2008, amounted to $96.3 million up from $55.7 million in the prior year. Such sales represented approximately 8.2% and 5.4% respectively of growth sales for the years concerned. Including such sales are direct sales to the company's military customers, which were delivered to such customers in the US. In periods prior to the 2008 third quarter, sale to these customers were classified as domestic sales. Due to this factor, the products were delivered to such customers in the US. In determining sales to customer outside of the US in the third and fourth quarters of 2008, the company recognized their product sold to such customers were in fact being cross-shipped to the military and their customers overseas, and were therefore included in the classification of sales to customers outside of the US during the periods concerned. As a result, fourth quarter 2007 comparative figures have been adjusted by $1.8 million, and from our respect of can suppliers. This will not apply across the board, however, as we did have certain contracts with very competitive aluminum pricing in 2008. We anticipate that we will, on average, be able to achieve lower can pricing in 2009, though as compared to 2008, while we were aside with a relatively smooth transition that we achieved over the first few months. As with any transition, there are bound to be hiccups. Some of the new bottles in branches were able to integrate the Monster brand readily while others encountered challenges. We are working through all the issues. Transitioning of brand from many different independent distributors to a large organizations such as Coca-Cola enterprises, will undoubtedly take longer to do. So then compared to a small entrepreneurial independent distributor, but one strong vision and the full power of that organization is fully behind the brand, we believe that we will be able to then reap the rewards through improved distribution and results. At the end of December we transitioned Canada from Pepsi to CCE. We dealt with a number of technical issues in the course of that transition, but CCE is now getting up to full speed in Canada. As a consequence, Monster sales, in certain, but not all markets that we are transitioned, were lower than in the comparable periods last year. Agreements have been reached on the severance payments due to many other our terminated distributors. In some cases, we were not able to arrive at a final agreement before December 31, 2008, and as a result portion of the inventory returns and severance payments will only be effected during the first quarter of 2009. However, we believe that we have fully accrued for such severance payment including those relating to Canada or Mexico in the fourth quarter 2008 results. We launched Monster through CCE in the UK at the beginning of January and in Belgium, Holland, Luxembourg, France, and Monaco during February. This is lighter than indicated in our previous communications. Sales in the UK and Europe during the first two months of 2009 have been inline with the expectations. The European operations of CCE were extremely motivated and excited with the launch and sale of Monster Energy in their respective countries. Sales of Monster in Sweden and Ireland continue to progress well. The performance of our distributor in Spain, however, has been disappointing and we are currently exploring our options for Spain. Fourth quarter operating income was adversely affected by losses incurred in the UK and Europe, which amounted to approximately $1.7 million for the quarter and $10.9 million for the full year. We have also commenced distribution of Monster energy drinks in Mexico, other than in Baja and Sonora with the Humax Group, which is off to a good start. Monster Energy is now the clear number two brand in Mexico. According to Nielsen, all outlets combined Monster share of the energy drink market in Mexico for the October-November timeframe 2008 was up 8.7 points to 25.1% for 16.4% a year ago. We have expanded the distribution of hydration enhanced water products which have zero calories and are continuing to secure additional distribution. Sales of hydration have been positive. According to the Nielsen report for the convenience channel, sales of hydration in Southern California on a third point basis are higher than sales of Snapple and Antioxidant Water, Sobe Light Water, and Propel. Our plan is to proceed with broader rollout of hydration enhanced water through distribution agreements with independent distributors. We are continuing with the rollout of Monster Hitman energy shooters in 3 ounce containers. We are in the process of launching two additional shooters in the same size containers. We have been successful in securing a number of retail listings for Hitman. The rollout has the great satisfactory through the Anheuser-Busch distributors we have. Although earlier limited number Coca-Cola bottlers have commenced selling it. An extensive launch of Hitman through the Coca-Cola bottlers is planned for March and April 2009. Gross sales of Hitman energy shooters in the fourth quarter were $10.9 million. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $256.8 million compared to $12.4 million at the end of December 2007. Short-term investments were at $29.1 million, compared to $63.1 million at the end of December, 2007. Investments, primarily auction rate securities, decreased from $227.1 million to $89.6 million. Trade accounts and distributor receivables increased to $136 million from $81.5 million at December 31, 2007. Days outstanding for receivables were 16.9 days at December 31, 2008 compared to 26.8 days at December 31, 2007 principally due to product returns in December from terminate to distributors. Inventories increased to $116.3 million from $98.1 million at December 31, 2007. The increase in inventories was primarily attributable to an increase in finished product of Monster, Monster Hitman energy shooter, and inventories in the UK. These increases were offset by decreases in can and concentrate inventories. Every days of inventory was 90.3 days at December 31, 2008 which is higher than the 73.1 days of inventory held at December 31, 2007. In the fourth quarter, total value of the inventory returned to us by terminated distributors resulted in a reduction of growth sales of about $9.7 million. In our press release we have provided certain financial information regarding terminated and new distribution agreements. We explained the impacts of the termination payments made to terminate the distributors to the income statement. Namely, the full amount is expensed in the quarter, including those distributors where we commence distribution in 2009, namely in Mexico and Canada. We also explained that while we will receive from newly appointed distributors, non-refundable contributions covering a significant portion of the cost of terminating certain distributors, such contribution will be accounted for as deferred revenue. Such deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue, ratably over the anticipated 20 year life of the distribution agreements. This explains the accounting treatment relating to the above. From a cash flow point of view, the above described transactions are expected to be largely neutral to the company, as we expect to receive payments for the contributions at approximately the same time as the payments are made to us by the terminated distributors. We continue to hold auction rate securities, having a fair value of $97.6 million at December 31, 2008 which is down from a fair value of $111.4 million at September 30, 2008 and $227.1 million at December 31, 2007. The $97.6 million fair value at December 31, 2008 reflect an impairment of $14.9 million; $14.4 million of which is deemed temporary, and was recorded net over tax benefit of $5.7 million as a component of other comprehensive loss. The remaining $0.5 million of impairment was other than temporary and we recorded a charge to net interest and other income for the year ended December 31, 2008 in that amount. During the fourth quarter the company repurchased 2,169,102 shares of common stock of the company for a total price of $53,500,498. This in addition to the 1,696,231 shares that’s repurchase by the company in the second quarter for a total price of $49, 965,997. Consequently, we repurchased a total of 3,865,333 shares for a total price of $103,466, 496 in 2008. I would now like to open the floor to questions. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you sir. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Thanks. Hey, Rodney.
Rodney Sacks: Hi.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Rodney, I am just trying to reconcile your sales growth in the quarter because it seems like that there are a lot of moving parts in the quarter. So, first you have the 12.8 million of deferred revenue that you got that was booked in the quarter. You also called out for 7 to 8 points of sales that benefited you in the fourth quarter of 2007 as the trade loaded up on inventory before the price increases.
Rodney Sacks: Right.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Was there any, I think you have talked about taking back some of the inventory from your existing wholesalers in the fourth quarter with the transition. Was that part of what happened in the fourth quarter sales number?
Rodney Sacks: Yes. That is a 9.7 million figure I referred to.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: So 9.7 million that you have taken back from the existing wholesalers. So that runs against your sales in the fourth quarter.
Rodney Sacks: Right.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then, in terms of your comment about that you are not seeing any improvement in the convenience and gas channel in the early part of this year that sounds a little bit different than what the other beverage companies have talked about, when they reported the fourth quarter results. So I am just trying to see, what you are seeing, and more specifically, in some of the premium non-carb category with respect to CNG channel, and if you are seeing actual improvement in CSP, but, maybe the consumers are holding back on some of the higher price point beverage products.
Rodney Sacks: We are seeing the energy category sales increase being pretty constant in the category was increasing in the 30% range or higher than that. There is 40% range in the second quarter, 30% range and it was sort of falling off in the third quarter, into the 20s and then high teens. In the fourth quarter, it really has been pretty consistent; there was a little bounce in November. But our numbers are showing the category in convenience, for example, as being 13.5% up in the four weeks ended October 2008 went back up to 14.9 which is still way up where we had been in September – in November and in sort of going down to about 13.3 in December. And it has been even now, it is January numbers are coming in at about flat at that level about 13.3. So we are seeing the numbers still staying down there. We do not feel there has been much improvement. There may have been improvement in some of the lower priced items going out of the door in the convenience, but in the energy category, we are seeing a sort of very similar to it has been over the past few months.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then in the fourth quarter, it looks like you had a pretty good expense control. The distribution costs as a percent of sales were down year-over-year, your selling expenses were also down as a percent of sales. I am just wondering if you made a conscious effort to sort of humbly down on some of these expenses and how we should think about those costs in 2009.
Rodney Sacks: I think that going forward we are going to obviously try and keep our cost inline. We are mindful of the economy and we are not sure, how torpid economy will bring better come back. But one of the main issues one of the main cost we have is our sponsorship and endorsement cost and those were down for the quarter, but overall were up on the year, quite high, based on the previous year, but those we obviously did look at clearing back somewhat in the fourth quarter because they were running high. They had been budgeted high and anticipated higher sales levels and where that would be brought back. But one of the things that has throw some of the numbers out quite a bit are the UK costs. For example we maintained we have kept our payroll costs pretty much inline. But our costs of where we put under marking about TDM program costs have gone up quite substantially, not so much in the US, but because of high extensive TDM sampling program that we did institute in the UK to start helping to see the brand and basically last year the sales we just didn’t get the listings as we have explained in previous calls and then we had this sort of the uncertainty and a little bit of disruption in our distribution. There was a disruption in the changeover. There was a delay in the changeover to CEE there, which again (inaudible) because we had to retain the existing distributor for the rest of the year and obviously you got a distributor is not very motivated and knows that he is sort of on the way out. So, that was really difficult and those costs are, when you consolidate all playing quite a bit of havoc with some of the percentage numbers. But by and large, we think that those costs will come inline; sales in the first two months in Europe were pretty much inline with our budgets. So things are settling down. Again there were some delays. We started off in the UK in January. There was a bit of delays to a couple of weeks in getting everything in order to really get going in on the continent that has gone in or started in February. We have good listings and that is going. We are pretty excited by how the launch is going in the continent. And we just think that going forward now, our cost in the UK obviously will be expensive when we are going to spend as much as necessary to make sure we can cede the brand and establish the brand there. We do think it is not going to have the sort of losses we had last year, anywhere near there. We think that it is going to be much more balanced and that will help our costs get a little more into line. But by and large, we think that our cost will be pretty well contained this year and we think we will at least maintain the levels that we have in 2008.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then just following up on the UK and the European launch. Would you expect to see some benefit in the first quarter with some of the pipelines filings as the launches take place in the first quarter?
Rodney Sacks: I think that it is still too small to have a real influence on our numbers here. Again in the first two months, we still got to have pretty disruptive effect from the transitions in the US and Canada. In Canada, we just start in January and literally for the first two months of the year, we had very little in the form of promotions. And so, I think the sales in Canada were soft. But we are seeing the pickup now. Going into mid February we are starting to see the older rate coming up quite dramatically and we think that March is going to be a big month in going forward. So, but it has taken, there are all hiccups in this transition at all. We are seeing in some of the different areas in the US and so going forward, it is just very difficult to look at this quarter. I think this is going to be a transitional quarter. There is no question about it. But as things are slowly settling down, we are clearly starting to see and appreciate the benefits of the strength and the professionalism of the systems that we are in the CCE systems and the AB distributors who we have transition to. So overall, we've two and we think systems operate in many different ways, but are very strong systems. That is how we see the year going forward. We have had some weakness in Java Monster products. Monster is still doing nicely. Part of that weakness we attribute to the fact that there was the launch during last year by Starbucks of their Doubleshot plus Energy Coffee drinks in similar size cans. I really just copied out cans. There were three of them; there flavors in that, they came up with, but they have been quite aggressive. Pepsi in marketing and promoting the products and they promoted it very aggressively. And they have taken some share, you know, and our execution is probably going little backwards with the regard to Java Monster and shelf space. And the right shelf space in the right section at the expense of the Starbucks products over the past few months. So, we have seen some softness in Java. We think obviously we need to address that; we will address that as part of the transition. And we have plans to go back and aggressively address that. We believe that will come up. But that is really where trading is headed in it in the first couple of months. They are all, as I said earlier there are some identified areas of pockets where we are seeing some softness in the numbers, Monster numbers, as part of the transition. We believe that is not due to the actual area because it is not in line with the area, but it really is attributable just to the actual transition and getting the brand into the hands of new distributor, getting them to understand the brand and work the brand and be able to promote it. And obviously, we think those will turnaround quite quickly because in other areas where for whatever reason there is a million of them, the distributors brought us in those areas we are able to jump on the brand much more quickly. We have seen these starting to see some of the benefits in those areas. And if you look at the Nielsen and examine it, you will see it normally is going through in some of the areas. There is just no reason for the brand to suddenly go after them, other than it being attributable to the change out. But again, we think that by the time we get through the first quarter that will be behind us and everything will be firing on pretty much on all cylinders going forward. 
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of (inaudible). Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good afternoon.
Rodney Sacks: Hi.
Unidentified Analyst: So, I just wanted to identify what are the main drivers of the higher gross margins around the quarter.
Tom Kelly: The main driver of the higher gross margins in the quarter were, firstly product mix of business launch, obviously slowing down of the Java Monster which gave us a higher margin. Monster product, the Monster energy shooters have a high margin than the traditional, many of the energy drink products as well. There is also the recognition of revenue through deferred revenue because there was, to terminate the distributors, there was some deferred revenue that was brought to account in the fourth quarter. And those are pretty much the factors which resulted in that higher margin. So that is sort of a more unusual situation and going forward. We do not expect that that would be at that level. It will go back more to the usual levels which were in the 52% range.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And with Coke going to distribute the Hitman product in, I guess, in the second quarter. Would you expect to see a little bit of a step-up in margins or is that not expected to be that significant?
Rodney Sacks: Again, it is just too small for us to tell. I mean, in theory, obviously from what I just said, they do have higher margins if they sell through. And the sell through starts picking up it will obviously help it, but again, it does take time to get it all of this going. It is a small brand filling the context of the whole company. But you know, there are nice margins. So that is obviously why we feel we will help the margins going forward. But as we do not want to give any further sort of indication of whether the margins will go up at this point, it is just too premature for us.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay and then regarding the recently announced Pepsi-Rockstar distribution deal. I mean, do you think that will have any impact to the competitive environment impact to Monster?
Rodney Sacks: Well, obviously we feel, that was going to be likely scenario when we went into the Coke system. The Rockstar could not obviously stay in the Coke system for too long. They needed to find a home and they had different alternatives which I am sure they investigated. They ended up with what was a reasonable system for them, which is a sort of one-stop shop result. We believe that will give them or may give them some boost in the short-term. Particularly in areas where Rockstar has had very limited or poor distribution until now, but has not been in the Coke system at all and just has not had good distribution. Obviously being in the Pepsi system there that will give, in those areas, they will see some uptick. There are other areas though that I think Pepsi is clearly weaker than the Coke system and we think that they going to suffer in those areas. Additionally, Pepsi has their own brand and it is one thing to go into a system where, what I call the AMP brand, is a much weaker brand and the bottler really could have your interest at heart and really put his heart and soul behind your brain. In the Pepsi case, it is going to be much more difficult for Rockstar because the AMP brand has been increasing in sales and getting market share. Pepsi have committed a lot of funds to marketing support and funds to the brand. They have come out with aggressive line extensions, they have just come out. We have seen another three line extensions and in fact the real competitor for Rockstar is in fact AMP. I mean, AMP is really close on the heels of Rockstar, has Rockstar in their sight. So there you are going to have a very competitive environment where it will be hard for us to speculate but we ought to probably see AMP coming out on top. And so that is going to be very competitive internally and we think that is going to cause some issues for them. By and large the Pepsi system is a strong system but we think that it is not in the long-term going to help Rockstar in the long-term. It is not going to change the position we are. We are actually quite happy that it happened sooner than later. It makes different lines clearly for our Coke partnership. The Coke distributors are clearly fully motivated and they know there is no mixed signal. They do not have to take care of another brand in their system and obviously try and do that brand justice if they can have their full devotion and attention to our brand which is by fair clearly the largest player in their portfolio. So we do believe that we are going to get the focus now and that it was in fact better for us the sooner that it happened than later and so we are not particularly concerned. We think that we will continue to grow in market share going forward with the system. We just have to settle it down. Rockstar is still going to have the rocky road of the transition ahead of them going into summer and so we think that going into the second quarter, we will have a lot of positives going for us.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with UBS. Please go ahead.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS:  Thank you. Hi everyone.
Rodney Sacks: Hi, Kaumil.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS:  In Europe you are going to expanding distribution, I think, much faster than you have in the US. Can you give us a read on how you plan to allocate investment spending in the UK? You had almost a 6-month headstart in some marketing and sponsorship investments but while you’re going through the rest of Western Europe, you are going to getting there much faster. So can you give us a read of what you are doing in terms of the sponsorships and how you are thinking about allocating spending there?
Rodney Sacks: We do not think that we are going to have to have that same sort of model for the rest of Europe that we had for the UK. What we did in the UK last year was largely laid the base for what we are now doing in Europe. What we are doing in the UK and Europe this year again is largely setting the base, not only for those countries, but for any additional countries we will go into. We do have plans to expand further in Europe. We were just obviously waiting to get these countries going and fully operational and then we will look to additional countries and we believe that a lot of the spend we are having, the principal amount of the spend we are having, leaving aside the local marketing, has already been set. Most of the properties, the amount properties we signed up on, are pretty much either international or pan-European. The deal we signed which is the major deal we have signed, which is one of the biggest deals we signed for the company with Rossi who is the World Champion MotoGP racer. It is a very important deal but it carries wherever we go because if we go, we launch in Australia, he is well known there. The MotoGP is a sport we will follow there; the same thing in the rest of Europe. Many of the races are held in countries that have not ever been in. And so we can go to those countries without worrying about an additional, what I call lead marketing property, which pretty much the Rossi deal gives us and it is a great show. How do we execute against that? We will execute obviously against that in the field and in stores against the Rossi relationship. We are also continuing which we did last year. We supported the Motocross in Europe the MX1 the MX2 series. We were the winners. Our team actually won the series and we have signed up with the same team. Again, it is a European series, which will transcend into all of territories we are currently selling in and new territories that we plan to go into later in the year. In conclusion, I launch additional capital allocation to marketing or to capital to enable us to go into those countries. We have a large infrastructure. We are really setup, based in the UK and Ireland, and basically it will be a lot easier and a lot more economical for us to expand from here on into Europe.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: All right. I see and then can you give us some help if is there any FX impact on the quarter and are you now manufacturing locally over there?
Rodney Sacks: We are manufacturing in the UK. We were doing a little bit of manufacturing here in shipping across, pretty much by and large all of our manufacturing is being done in the UK. As we go through the year, we will believe some of that manufacturing will also be done by CCE for us in the UK, and Europe was greater than UK, but for Europe.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: Manufacturing in the UK?
Rodney Sacks: We will continue to manufacture in Europe for that market and then we think if that is a time a lot of our costs will start going down. Our costs started going down as well as even with our existing pack up as our volume start to become more regular and as we get inventory going, we can have longer runs.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: Got it. And then last question. Red Bull had gone through a bit of a restructuring over the last 12 months or so. Have you seen any changes in their competitive behavior in the US?
Rodney Sacks: Not really. We think that, in certain respects, today we are seeing a little more in some of the actions sports which were more than a quarter ago in many years. They seem to have gone into a number of additional properties in recent years and now I think some are going back a little bit to their roots. But, they are still continuing to market in the same way as they have individual properties that they create and they develop as they sort of owned their own events. And they spent quite a lot of money on that.  So, we do not see that we come out with the three SKUs with a cola product, which has not been particularly successful within in a month. We understand they are going to come out with an energy shot in the next couple of months, but, which again, is probably a little bit light but will make the energy short market more comparative. And we think that the leading energy drinks in that area will affect soon star taking major share of that category and become more and more important in that category. Basically, that category will probably be more in the traditional energy categories, and how we see it in some years to come.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: Okay. That's good for me. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alton Stump with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Thank you, Good afternoon.
Rodney Sacks: Good afternoon, Alton.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Two quick questions. First off, can you give us any idea on your gross sales performance in the first two months of the year? I am sorry if I missed that earlier.
Rodney Sacks: The first two months of the year are really difficult to compare. Sales were soft, starting off in January, part of the year of the transition we have seen a pickup. February though has not closed yet. So we are seeing, basically, the numbers are up a little bit, but basically it is very premature for us to say this. It is very difficult to go without going to a lot of detail as to explain the numbers. And I would, in this call, like to really identify the first two months have really been transitional and is very difficult for us to give you that the direction. We think there is too much room for misinterpretation and not being able to understand the number fully for us to really go into them with you at this time because of all the changes that are going back there. There are product returns being received, there are number of issues as well as the fact that we just did not close it. So, we think, we would like to wait until the end of the quarter and then we get the full quarter numbers, which obviously we will report on. It would have been much better to handle on the direction of the company that transition and how it is settling down for you guys.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Okay. And then one just quick follow-up and I think you cover this twice already, so sorry about this part. Within $9.7 million that was taken back from wholesalers. Could you just explain what exactly happened there and why there was that amount taken back?
Rodney Sacks: What happened is that when we have this transition, wholesalers, the distributors have a lot of inventory. They have effectively there are two options that they can follow. One is to continue to sell that inventory into the trade, and the second is to then return that inventory to us. In some cases, the agreements provided they were entitled to them and in some cases they were provided that we were entitled to accept or decline to purchase the inventory back. Where they were small amounts, we generally did not purchase it back because there is a cost, actually, it was picking it up and re-transporting it and resorting it. But the other side of the coin is that you do not want to leave too much inventory out in the trade because they start selling it. Often it has been (inaudible). They just want to cover their cost. And that structure erupting your new distributor, which we did have some up. So what was happening is our new distributors would go into an account that they would normally call hoping that they would so Monster together with the Coke together with their other products. And the store really just had a delivery from, in this case, maybe Dr. Pepper or 7UP or one of other distributors. And so it becomes disruptive because they cannot really sell because the guys got product in the stores that is being given to him at a discounted price in order to simply move it through. So in many cases, we opted for picking up the product and taking them back from the distributors to try and not to avoid the market that just has been flooded with basically low priced inventory and the market of the new distributors disrupted. And so that is really why you see that figure of that $9.7 million. It is basically the products returned back but then the effect of that is they get affected as a reduction is sales.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Okay. Thank you.
Rodney Sacks: There will be a little bit more for the distributors that we terminated as I indicated in my remarks during the first quarter because not all of them were finalized and terminated in the fourth quarter but it will be lower. The other thing is just saying one thing about (inaudible). I just want to say that on the numbers for the first two quarters the Monster, sales numbers are up. And as I indicated earlier, what we were seeing was some weakness in the Java Monster which we need to address, but Monster itself has been performing positively and is up quite nicely.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Okay. Thank you, Rodney.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.
Rodney Sacks: If I mentioned the first two quarters obviously I was referring to the first two months, sorry. Okay. Hi Mark, sorry.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Good afternoon.
Rodney Sacks: Good afternoon.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: I guess just trying to reconcile some of what is going on the top line. If I back out what was going on in terms of inventory repurchase and then reflecting the amount of buying ahead of the price increases last year, I get a volume or a top line growth number somewhere in the low double digit range. I guess, one. Is that correct? And then secondly, you talked about some impact relating to disruptions due to the shift over the Coke enterprises and other Coke bottlers and you said that some markets for sales were actually negative. So, can you adjust that low double digit top line number to reflect for those markets and basically just try to give us what a normalized or run rate top line number would be for the quarter?
Rodney Sacks: We cannot give you that normalized number and back that out because in many cases we did not have good information and also pretty recently from our distributors as to what was happening in the markets. We are seeing the markets. We are seeing but if you are going to the [Hansen], you will see some of the negative numbers and then you say, why are we low here, why are we down in the number mocked for example in grocery. We know that in grocery we are down because grocery is to some extent driven by promotions and over the provisional (inaudible). There were very little promotions being done. We are going to get things straightened out. I tell you, in some cases, the grocery side seems to have taken more of a hiccup for example than the convenience. But the assumption that you are making in a market, depending on how you slice and dice the numbers, I think that you are in the right region of pretty much the low double digit numbers if you take the brand and you make those sort of adjustments in the fourth quarter for the increase. But it is just hard for us at this time to actually do the exercise you are asking. We have not done it so I cannot really speak to it. I can only give you the trends of what I would call our main product line which is Monster itself and to say that year-to-date, and again, we have not closed off these amount. But it is quite decently positive into the probably north of the double digit area.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, that is good. So basically, just to summarize that and if you say that the real number in the fourth quarter was somewhere in the low double digits for a revenue growth standpoint, there was an impact due to the shift disruption and therefore on a run rate basis the top line number should then be slightly better than that or at least it would have been slightly better than that, if the Coke disruption did not happen?
Rodney Sacks: Possibly, I mean it is in America, it is Coke. Also, I wanted to just say it is the Coke distributors. There was also disruption in going to IB distributors who were new distributors as well. But it is just that we are focused more on the Coke side than on the [AV] because most of the transitions are into, when I call it CCE again, I do not want just limit it to CCE. I mean, there were disruptions in transitions to Coke United, Coke Consolidated, Coke Sacramento. The other it is into the whole system. It is just part of the transitioning of a brand.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Great. Okay. In terms of thinking about the benefits that you potentially will receive because of the new distribution, what sort of things do you think you can point us to that will be like tangible evidence of this? Meaning the energy channel was being pretty under-indexed in the supermarkets and club stores versus convenient stores. Do you expect to see an increase in the shelf space and sales in those markets at some point going forward?
Rodney Sacks: We think we are all getting additional shelf space and we think other energy drinks are as well. But we know that the Coke system is strong in the convenience or in the grocery channel. They have, for example, two checkout counters that we have never been able to really get into until now in any meaningful way. So we believe that is a positive. We believe there are non-traditional channels that Coke go to that the previous distributors and peer distributors also do not go to. We believe that the Coke organization together with the support from the IB yard, but the Coke organization is just generally stronger in grocery. So we think there will be an increased focus and emphasis on that execution, on promotions, on size decks. When other Coke products are on promotion, we believe there will be a benefit for Monster. We also think that what we can get from the Coke system, because of the depth of their army out there, is better execution in stores. So, where we have got listings, that have secured shelf space. In many cases we have the shelf space in theory, but in the practice and then in the real world, it has been a tougher battle out there and we have not always got what we have paid for a boat. We think that we have a much higher prospect of getting it done with Coke and when that execution goes, out they are much more disciplined and where in those stores frequently enough to protect that space. So we think that the dips and the quality of dips of the distributions will improve. I mean, even today alter many years, as we have been in the energy category and worked on main product is now up to for example 93% distribution in convenience. The measuring drop offs you were 82 for Lo-Carb and 56 for 24-ounce, Khaos use a 69 and Mad of 59. So, you look into that area and there is a lot f room for increase depth of distribution. Our 4 packs distribution is down at very low its better obviously in grocery, but very low in convenience. Even on Java Monster our best item is up 62%. So there is a lot of room. I mean, the new items are in the 30% range. So the new items and everything else really have been given what we think is a (inaudible) shorter at yet and so we do believe that those are the things that will start benefiting the brand as we go forward. There will be a lot of great news that we could not get before; where we think that the Coke distributors will be able to take the brand and whether that campuses and sports arenas, some of the them, while we are going to have to sharing the cost of securing the size, but others we think will become part of the deal and part of the things like vending. There's a lot of opportunities that we have not had before because vending for example, is not something that is very (inaudible) hardly any bending through the beer cans. So that [I normally] do that. So those are opportunities that we think that will open up for us and the challenge is being able to work with the system. We are very excited. We think that they are going to be behind the brand. I was down in Atlanta on Tuesday and gave a presentation to their global meeting of the full CCE System. I think there is a commitment from them. I think the fact they ratchet it up has been time to really get to their team throughout the world, to get to now understand the brand, to know what it is, what it stands for. It shows that there is a commitment by them to make the brand happen, to make things happen for us. So those are sort of basic pretty much the reasons we have seen. We, for being optimistic, have been able to get better execution out of the system. But on the other hand, it is a very big system and it is a challenge to work through the layers of people in the system and at the branches.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: 
Great.:
Rodney Sacks: We have just taken on a Senior Executive, who was an ex-CCE executive, Steve Megan, to basically head-up our relationship with Coke and to be available in Atlanta full-time to work with the Coke, not any CCE, but the other Coke bottlers and to make sure that we are able to communicate with each other, that we get things done that we want and need done from them. What they need from us is taking care of because that is the challenge. It is a very big organization and it is a challenge to work your way through it. So we are all taking steps to try and make sure that this relationship really does benefit both of us and that we both end up benefiting from what we think the increase distribution and sales. We are hopeful we will get through the relationship.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, great. And then finally, on the share repurchase. You got about $50 million left under the authorization. What are your thoughts on that going forward and then for Hilton, I guess, in terms of amount of shares outstanding? I am assuming it was down because of options.
Rodney Sacks: I think the amount outstanding is closer to $100 million available under the program. It is still active, and we will obviously look to continuing to implement it. We will see how we go as we go through the year. We are going through pretty difficult times at the moment not knowing where, what direction anything is going into. So, we want to cautious but on the share is held-up pretty nicely, but we are clearly going to look to, continuing to execute that program as an appropriate time. Hilton, perhaps could address the share issue, share number if you could.
Hilton Schlosberg: Well, the number of shares has come down from 2007, and that is principally because of the share repurchase scheme and also the analysis that is being done instead of Black-Scholes model for option.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Perfect, thanks guys.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you, Mark.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Van Winkle with Canaccord Adams. Please go ahead.
Scott Van Winkle - Canaccord Adams: Hey Rodney, a couple of questions. You mentioned in the January and February in the transition period. I am wondering, do you know what percentage of your distributors that were displaced by the new Coke and Anheuser distribution have already put inventory back to you or returned product and how much of that hangs over into January and February? Give a rough idea that are half three quarters, a quarter that type of thing?
Rodney Sacks: It could be a little bit gift on our part, but I would say we probably have closer to two thirds of the way through.
Scott Van Winkle - Canaccord Adams: And you have fairly easy comparison on a volume basis year-over-year because of the buying ahead of the price increase last year in January and February. So, when you talk about being difficult to kind of lead through the numbers and you mentioned Java is the inventory coming back a primary reason?
Rodney Sacks: No, there are issues in different markets and we just have to deal with it individually and we just have not done that. We have not actually gone and tried to analyze each and every market and attribute the reason in each and every market.
Scott Van Winkle - Canaccord Adams: And you mentioned that in Canada you accrued for some of the termination payments that probably came in January and February when you reached agreement. Do you also accrue for inventory returns that you anticipate might come back in January and February?
Rodney Sacks: We have accrued for inventory returns, yes. But there may still be some additional ones, but we did do an accrual for inventory, yes.
Scott Van Winkle - Canaccord Adams: And the last question. You talked about margin improvements as you get volume in the UK and Europe. Is the ultimate margin structure going to be similar over there that is here in the US?
Rodney Sacks: No.
Scott Van Winkle - Canaccord Adams: Can you expand on that at all?
Rodney Sacks: Firstly, I do not think we talked about margin improvement. I think we said that here the margins were likely to be inline. And secondly, in Europe I think they are probably going to be a little less income based on our cost of goods and there will be quite a change in that cost of goods as we secure additional packing with the CCE Group. There will be a lot of cross-board costs of freight and costs for getting movement and we are arguing that will disappear. Cost of production will be a little lower. So that is going to be the sort of change over as we go through the Europe because we are redoing one of the plants at the moment and re-equipping it. And when that gets up and running later in the year that is when we start. We hope to be able to start manufacturing some of our products. They still will not be able to manufacture all of our products but there is a certain amount and then they will be able to work with us. But, the margins we think in Europe at this point, our best estimate, is that European margins are probably lower than the US margins.
Scott Van Winkle - Canaccord Adams: And I think I missed some of your comments about the hydration product. I heard the good results in Southern California. Did you mention what your plans are after the success you have had thus far in?
Rodney Sacks: We are doing a test with the IB distributors in Florida, starting round about now, in a couple of weeks' time. It has not started yet. It is about to start. We do have some independent distributors in other places, Midwest, and we are looking at the best brand. We are looking at to consider exactly what system we should put it in. We have got a listing for the product in [Sands] and we are seeing how that is going to start selling through. We are looking at the possible opportunity of whether that should be more aligned to the bad system or independence and there we have not yet come up with a final decision and have not had final discussions with the Board on that. So that is why I say it is still pretty much up in the air. But we are looking at it, and over the next couple of months have to be in a position to start making decisions and going in one direction or the other.
Scott Van Winkle - Canaccord Adams: And lastly, just a follow-up to earlier question about cost. You talked about dialing back some of the sponsorship activity in the back half of the year. If I remember correctly, part of that was seasonal; you had some spending in the first half of the year around some events. Do we see that pickup sequentially in the first half of this year, and kind of follow the same pattern or was the dialing back that we saw in the back half just going to continue here in the first half of this year?
Rodney Sacks: No, I think that we have sort of looked at our spending and we have tried to get the spending sort of a little more spread over the year. But again, there are some events at the early part of this year. For example, one of the big properties we do is the Motocross where we sponsor the series plus we have riders and the MotoCross Show which has a different time scale to Europe. So that is sort of probably SKU towards the first half of the year. But generally we have set our budgets for 2009 and trying to be pretty much inline with 2008 and but probably a little smoother. There will probably be a little bit higher in the early months. But we think that we will be able to hopefully be able to manage a little more. In the case of last year, we sort of reached out and we actually pulled back some of the spending as we went through the year. So you saw a drop. For that reason we think it will be more balanced this year going forward.
Scott Van Winkle - Canaccord Adams: Thank you. 
Rodney Sacks: Thanks. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude the question-and-answer session. Mr. Sacks I will turn it back over to you for closing comments. 
Rodney Sacks: Thank you very much. Once again, I would like to thank all of the analysts for their support. We are going through this quarter, it is a transitional quarter which makes it, we understand, a little (inaudible) for you to guide to through your own analysis but unfortunately it is the nature of the beast. It is transitional and that is where you should be going through. But we all very hopeful about it. We do have very positive attitude from the bottle distributors that we have transitioned to as well as from the Coke, the whole Coke system, to work with us and we do believe that they will put all the efforts behind the brand to help to make it a success. And we believe that this decision was the right decision for our brand particularly on the long-term basis. We think we have a good home just looking at the different product offerings in the Coke system. We think that the match up was the right match up for us. And so long-term we are very excited. We think that this will really help give us a good start now in Europe and give the brand a solid base to work from. So we look forward to starting to expand and throughout the world and to grow the brand and to truly become a global brand. We think we have that potential. And we are going to obviously. We are doing our best to achieve it. So, once again, thank you for your support and we hope to be able to report some good progress to you when we release our first quarter results on the transition and on the European launch. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's teleconference. We do thank you again for your participation. And at this time you may disconnect.

===== 2008 Q3  (2008-11-06 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Rodney Sacks - Chief Executive Officer
Analysts: Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Alex Paterson - RCM Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs
Operator:  Good day, everyone. Thank you for joining today's Hansen Natural Corporation's third quarter 2008 financial results conference call. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introduction, I would now like to turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Rodney Sacks. Please do ahead, sir.
Rodney Sacks: 
 : Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of Management, with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends. Management cautions that these statements are based on Management's currently knowledge and expectations and of subject to certain risks and uncertainties many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made herein. Please refer to the section headed "Caution Concerning forward-looking statements" in our earnings release as well as to our filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K filed on February 29, 2008 and our most recent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, including the sections contained therein titled "Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements" for discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. We have provided an explanation of the non-GAAP of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call in the notes designated with asterisks in the consolidated, consolidated or dense consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated November 6, 2008. A copy of this information is also available on our website www.hansens.com in the Investor Relations section.  Consistent with what I have said during my last quarterly report, I reiterate that the energy drink category continues to remain one of the few sectors in the beverage industry that continues to show year-on-year growth. The growth of the entire beverage industry continues to slow consistence with the general slowdown and the weak US economy, the housing market decline and soaring fuel and food costs, which are hampering the spending power of US consumers, who we continue to believe have cutback on impulse purchases at gas stations, amongst other places, gas stations being the most important sector for energy drinks. While this trend is more marked in California, which is one of the largest energy drink markets, it is a nation wide trend. We continue to believe that this trend continues to disproportionately affect blue-collar workers, who make up a large portion of our consumer base. The recent upheaval in and dislocation of financial markets appears to have contributed to a reduction in demand for many commodities, with the result that we are now starting to see reduced gas prices at the pumps. We are hopeful that if these levels continue the lower cost or filing up cost will free up disposable income to consumers to spend more at stores at gas stations. However, in light of the continuing volatility in most markets that affect the lives of everyday consumers, we will have to wait and see what trends emerge. Positive news for us is that despite these factors, the Monster brand has continued to grow in excess of the category and generated the majority of additional dollars earned by the category. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through September 27, 2008 for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass excluding Wal-Mart, the energy drink category grew 9.8%. In actual dollar volume the category increased in sales by a total of $115 million to $1286 million for the 13-week period concerned. Of the increase $68 million was contributed by increased sales of Monster, of which $30.5 million was attributable to increase sales of Java Monster. $27 million from increase sales of Red Bull, $5 million from increase sales of Rockstar and $40 million from increase sales of Amp. Full Throttle was $18 million lower in sales, but NOS was $23 million higher, No Fear was $13 million lower and Adrenaline Rush was $10 million lower. According to Nielsen's all outlets combined, Monster's market share is 27.9% up 3.1 points. Red Bulls' market share is 37.8%, down 1.1 points. Rockstar's market share is 11.1%, down 0.7 of a point. Amp's market share is 7.8%, up to 2.6 points. While Full Throttle's market share is 4.4%, which is down 2 points. NOS' market share is 2.9%, up 1.7 points, excluding Java Monster Monster's market share is still 25.8% up, 2.3 points over the last year. In dollar terms, Monster sales are 23.4% higher, compared to Red Bull at 6.3%. The convenience and gas channel grew by 10% over the prior year. Monster's market share increased to 29.1%, on an increase of 23.8% in sales versus Red Bull, whose market share decreased to 34% on an increase of 7.6% in sales. Rockstar's market share decreased to 10.7%, while Amp's share increased to 7.7%. Full Throttle share dropped to 4.6%, while NOS' share increased to 3.2%. According to Nielsen, the convenience and gas channel represented 81.4% of energy drink sales in the 13 weeks ended September 27, 2008. For the three months ended September 30, sales of Java Monster in the company represented approximately 10% of the total sales of the Monster brand, so according to Nielsen, they do represent a higher percentage, based on sales out from the retailers to consumers. For the three months ended September 30, 2008, sales to retail grocery specialty chains and wholesalers represented 8% of gross sales, which is the same as last year. Sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandises represented 12% of sales, which was down from 16% in the previous year. Sales to full service distributors represented 75% of sales, up from 72% last year. And sales to health food distributors was flat at 2%, and to military and others, was 3%, which was up from 2% in the previous year. For the nine-month period ended September 30, sales to retail grocery amounted to 8% compared to 9% in the previous year. Sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandises amount to 13%, compared to 50% in the previous year, while sales to full service distributors represented 74% of sales compared to 72% the previous year. Sales to health food distributors were flat to 2% and sales to military and others were 3%, which was up from 2% in the previous year. For the three month ended September 30th, gross sales outside of California increased from 72.1% to 75.6%, while for the nine months gross sales outside the California represented 77% of sales, up from 72.2% last year. Gross sales to customer outside of the United States amounted to $31.1 million, compared to $13.9 million in the same quarter last year, and represented approximately 9.6% of gross sales, up from 4.9% in the same period last year. Gross sales to customers outside of the United States for the nine months ended September 30, 2008, amounted to $79.4 million, up from $40.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2007. Such sales represented approximately 8.9% and 5.4% respectively of gross sales for the nine months periods concerned. We have started to see reductions in costs of certain raw-materials, principally apple juice, aluminum, milk and sugar. Although, dairy products rose in the third quarter, the cost of the milk component has since decreased. The reduction in the price of aluminum will not necessarily be reflected right across the board, as we do have contracts, some of which have afforded us the opportunity of lower can prices from certain suppliers during the current year and some of those contracts will come up for adjustments as we go forward. So, I want to caution although I have reefed to just the aluminum costs having gone down, that doesn’t necessarily equate on an unqualified basis across our can costs. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $256.4 million, compared with $12.4 million at the end of December 2007. Short-term investments were $14.8 million, compared to $63.1 million at the end of the December 2007. Accounts receivable decreased to $73 million from $81.5 million at December 31, 2007. Although, inventories increased to $110 million from $98.1 million at the end of December, they were lowered than they were at the end of the second quarter. Investments, primarily auction rate securities, decreased from $227 million to a $109.5 million. Days outstanding for receivables were 23 days at September 30, 2008, compared to 28.7 days at the end of December 2007, and 31.2 days at September 30, 2007. The increase in the inventories was primarily attributable to an increase in finished products of Monster and Java Monster. Average days of inventory were 73.3 days of September 30, 2008, which is higher than the 73.1 days of inventory held at December 31, 2007 and 71.2 days at September 30, 2007. I'll refer to our press release of October 6, 2008, in which we provided certain financial information regarding distribution agreements. In that announcement, we explained that the pretax impact of termination payments that we expect to make to terminated distributors is currently estimated to be in the range of the $110 million to $130 million in aggregate, but could be higher or lower. Actual termination payments could differ significantly from current estimates, because these estimates are based largely on our estimate of each affected distributor's contractual termination rights. This estimate includes, estimates of each distributors own sales and profit levels net of certain allowances. The actual termination cost will be expensed in full, in the period in which the termination has become effective, which will primarily be in the fourth quarter of 2008. We will receive from newly appointed distributors, non-refundable contributions covering a significant portion of the cost of terminating affected distributors, which will be accounted for as deferred revenue. Such deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue, ratably over the anticipated 20 year lot of the distribution agreements. This explains the accounting treatment of the above, from a cash flow point of view the above described transactions are expected to be neutral to the company, as largely neutral, as we should receive payment of the contributions in close proximity of time, to the finance that would be required to be made by us to terminated distributors. We continue to hold auction rate securities, having a fair value of $111.4 million at September 30, 2008, which is down from a fair value balance of $124 million at June 30, 2008, and $227 million at December 31, 2007. This amount reflects an impairment of $5.6 million, which we deemed to be temporary, and was recorded net over tax benefit of $2.2 million as a component of other comprehensive loss. We will continue to review the fair value and treatment to be afforded to these securities at the end of each of quarter. We recently announced distribution arrangements with Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola Enterprises, and certain other Coca-Cola Bottlers within the United States. These arrangements are scheduled to commence on November 10, 2008. Consequently, during the third quarter, Coca-Cola Bottlers and certain new Anheuser-Busch distributors purchased substantial products to ensure that they will have sufficient inventory in their warehouses and at distribution points around the territory for which they have been appointed when they commence sales. Such purchases had the effect of substantially increasing sales during October and more than offset the fall off in sales from distributors who are being terminated. We expect that once the new distribution arrangements going into effect, distributors whose distribution arrangements with the company have been terminated, will seek to return to us unsolved inventory in their possession. While we may not be legally obligated to take back all such inventory, we believe that in most instances it will in our best interest to do so and thereby avoid such inventory being dumped on to the market, which should have a disruptive on the orderly transition from existing distributors to the new Coca-Cola Bottlers and new Anheuser-Busch distributors. Consequently, we expect the return of certain amount of inventory, principally in November and December in the United States and in the first quarter of 2009 in Canada, which will have effect of reducing sales during those months. In light of these factors, we believe it would not be appropriate for us to report sales for October at this time. We believe that the afore going adjustments will largely have worked their way through the system by the yearend apart from Canada. We are pleased to report that we've now launched Monster Hitman energy shooter in 3 ounce sized containers. Gross sales of Hitman energy shooters within the third quarter were just under $3 million. We are continuing with the planned development of a new line of Monster energy products. We are working through certain production and technical issues in connection with the development of that line. Although, we do not believe we will be in a position to launch it before the end of the year. We currently anticipate that we will be in a position to launch that line during the first quarter of 2009. We continue to believe that the energy category will rebound, and continue to grow at an increased rate during 2009, as the economy and financial markets stabilize. We have now launched Monster energy drinks in a number of countries in Europe, including Sweden, Ireland and Spain, in addition to the United Kingdom. Operating income was adversely affected during the quarter by losses incurred in the United Kingdom and Europe of approximately $4.3 million, in consequence of a distribution agreements completed by our company with the Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola Enterprises. It is anticipated that Coca-Cola Enterprises will commence the distribution of Monster energy in the United Kingdom during November in place of our existing distributor. We are planning to launch Monster energy in conjunction with Coca-Cola Enterprises in France, Monaco, Belgium, Holland and Luxemburg at the beginning of 2009. We are also planning to commence distribution of Monster energy drinks in Canada through Coca-Cola Enterprises, commencing January 1, 2009 We have extended the distribution test of Hydration enhanced water to a number of additional areas, and are continuing to evaluate consumer demand and resale levels for that product with the view to expanding distribution commencing in 2009. Finally, with regard to new products, I am pleased to report that we will launching an additional Hitman energy shooter in three ounce containers and hope to be able to do so before the end of this year. I’d like to open the floor to questions. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). We will take our first question from Judy Hong at Goldman Sachs
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Hey, Rodney.
Rodney Sacks: Hello, Judy.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: First, in terms of the distribution transition, is there anyway to quantify in October, how much of your sales would have been boosted by inventory building? I know you are not giving the October number per se, but is there anyway to quantify that number?
Rodney Sacks: No, we have not done so.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: What about in terms of how much of the inventory that you will be taking back from your old distributors?
Rodney Sacks: Really, it is a guess. We have no knowledge of what inventory levels they have. How they will sell through, whether they have been holding a lot of inventory or a little. We just do not know.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Generally speaking is that a week of inventory, two weeks?
Rodney Sacks: I do not know.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. In terms generally speaking, I know that we are hearing a lot from wholesalers and retailers that they are tightening down inventory even more in this difficult financial situation. I am just wondering if generally speaking if you are hearing similar comments from your customers or that is not happening in your category.
Rodney Sacks: Well really have not heard anything different. I think that in past calls we have discuss this and we have refer to the fact that we believe there has been a destocking by our own customers, by retailers, by everybody to try and minimize their holding cost and that was discussed by us in the context, on a number of the calls, the discrepancy between what we were seeing in sale through to customers from retailers through the Nielsen numbers and our own sales, there was this inconsistency So that is way we are. It has been happening for sometime and I think it is just continuing to happen, everybody is just taking a conservative view and try to conserve cash and that goes for every type of customer, all the way through from the distributors, and bottlers, to the retailers.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Then Rodney, just in terms of the international opportunity, it seems like even without the go of the European launch, you have been able to grow your sales outside the US, and it is now close to 10% of sales. So I am wondering if you can just frame for us as you have got launch with the new distribution agreement in the UK and in some other parts of Western Europe in the next year or two years or three years, what mix are we looking at in terms of how much international could be of your total company?
Rodney Sacks: We really do not know, as you can see from the results that we have given, it was a slow bolt in the United Kingdom partly attributable we think to our distributor, not having the strength and some how the focus to get listings and partly due to timing. That is been that, but where it has gone into stores, the feedback we have got is that sold right has been good, it is been stronger than the number of our competitors. So in many cases where we have gone into a chain and then given us test in certain number of stores, we have in recent months also actually increased, and they have comeback reasonably quickly and said we wanted to increase the coverage. So, we are seeing good results, but it is taking time to bolt. We seem to have got probably a lot more coverage, more quickly in Sweden and even in Ireland, and we have managed to succeed in the UK. It is just again a different distribution systems and the easier way of getting to market in Sweden, particularly, and there we have seen some good results. Its just too soon, we think that the strength and the depth of the organization of CCE in United Kingdom and France will be very important contributors to out ability to get our products on the shelf in 2009. We are making, and starting to make presentations now, both on organizations and in conjunction with CCE for listings and shelf space for next year and its been done in time. So we believe that we will be able to get on the shelves, and we believe that both of those countries have large populations, and then we have followed that principally with Holland and Belgium. We believe that we can look forward to some healthy distribution gains and we hope to sell through. It is very new, we do not have experience in those countries and we really are not in a position to give any guidance concerning what extent we believe we will actually achieve distribution, at what level, and what the sales rights will be, we know that sales right in Europe and UK is generally seems to be a little lower than in the US. Generally that is the case for soft drinks and we think that energy drinks would be similar in effect, because we believe that the energy category is not as well developed there, it has the opportunity, but it is going to take time to bolt. Certainly the ability of having the CCE system working in conjunction with us and our brand, we think will be very beneficial to assent our efforts to get the brand distributed and sell. So we are very hopeful and we are optimistic, but I just can not give you any real numbers or any guidance on where we feel that will turn out, what effect it will have on our numbers generally.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Then just my final question Rodney; would you update us on how you are thinking about pricing going forward? You have talked about some of the input cost coming down more recently, but you have some contracts in place that are showing up as a bit more inflationary, how were you thinking about pricing?
Rodney Sacks: At this stage we feel that, we are not going to look at any pricing adjustments. We will wait and see what happens with somebody's cost, we think that, that we will be able to continue to trade at a fair level at and over the fair level of margin, at these pricing levels. So we do not think we should be looking to adjust prices at this time, particularly, in the light of the current economic environment. We just do not know. These are things that we are looking at from month-to-month and we will see what affect they have. So I really can not give you a definite answer on, whether we will or will not increase prices. All I can say to you is that at this stage, we are not envisaging any immediate price increase, but we will review it from month-to-month.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you.
Rodney Sacks: Thanks.
Operator: We will take our next question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel Nicolaus.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Good afternoon. Question, first on the Coca-Cola Enterprise's relationship, just wondering what steps you all are taking, in terms of working with CCE to ensure a smooth transition in both the US, and Europe, as well Canada?
Rodney Sacks: I mean, that is an operational issue. We obviously are working with them; we are working with their teams. Our sales reps are working with their individual branches and divisions. That is something we operationally do. Just like we have would start off, we would normally kick off any new distributor, you explain the brand to them, and you talk with them, and you get them to understand your selling proposition, and way you are selling and way your chains and customers are. It is just an operation issue. I could not give you any more color than that. Obviously, we are out in the field working with the appropriate people at CCE, and in fact for the new ID distributors that are coming on board as well, and working on helping them and guiding them on what we think is important in going out and selling and merchandizing the brand and what we consider important in that regard.
Unidentified Company Representative: As well as the other counter parties.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Yes, they are all under there, independent co-partners, there is United and Consolidated, who have come on board, Sacramento and some others.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. In terms of thinking about Europe, which is obviously a relatively new market for you all, how will you be working with the Coke system there in terms of supporting the brand launch, in other words, I am assuming that you are going to be hang for some of the support, and I am assuming that the Coke systems will also help pay for some of that support, is that fair to assume?
Rodney Sacks: I do not want to go into the details of how it is going to be structured. We have a particular structure with them, which ultimately will result in the brand being promoted, but we obviously are going to do what is normal. We are going to the normal programs at a store level to get consumer demand we are already doing substantial global marketing for the brand in the UK and Europe generally. We have signed contracts; we really did that last year, so we have already set the tone and the scene for the brand. The brand already has some level of awareness in Europe from what we have done during 2008. We have sponsored substantial music events in the UK, substantial motor sports, Supercross, Motocross Superbike in Britain, and particularly, the large one is probably our MotoGP, we were a sponsor of the Kawasaki team internationally, the sport extends internationally, but its pretty much focused on Europe, and has is a very high visibility for our consumer. So we have already done that and we are continuing to do that going forward. We have spent ahead of the brand. We think that that has been the main contributor to the losses that we have incurred in the UK. We think that has been a good investment spent, but it has been done and we will continue to spend going forward, we believe it will be probably substantially less of an impact on our sales, as our sales increase. We will continue to support the brand, but its going to come principally from us. There are a different ways in which you cut off the margin, but ultimately it comes out of the margin chain and we are playing to spend at a sufficiently high level to make sure the brand has every chance for success in Europe.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. Great. Then just thinking on a worldwide basis, if you look around what market do you see that you are not in that are potentially intriguing from an energy category standpoint?
Rodney Sacks: That would just be premature at this point. We really are focused on Europe at this time. There are some other markets, which I do not want to go in to, we are looking at, but Europe is pretty much the prime focus of where we are looking. We are selling elsewhere. We are looking at the Australian, New Zealand market, but really our focus is on Europe at this time.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Great and just finally on share repurchase. Can you talk a bit about where that stands, where you are headed in terms of potential increase in the authorization that you have?
Rodney Sacks: Well, I think we first go to; we first go to basically use up the current authorization. In the lines of the discussions and negotiations that we are underway with Coca-Cola, we really are not in a position, which obviously now you can see why, to do anything during the last open period. We believe that we will resume the share buy back once we are in a position to do so, in a couple of days' time. The debt line, depending on how that share buy back goes, we will consider looking at increasing to buy back depending on, where we see the pricing, just on the timing basis. So that is our current thinking. The Board will have to evaluate whether to increase, is it something which I certainly an Hilton do not. We can not make that decision on our own. We will be raising that with the Board.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Alright. Great, thanks.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Greg Badiskanian with Citi.
Unidentified Analyst: Hello, I am standing in for Greg. Just wondering, if you have a sense for how the energy drink market is holding up in the UK and in Europe and given the timing of watching of the launching there or you seeing any customers who wants to take on inventory there?
Rodney Sacks: We think, the market has continued to hold up. Its growth was historically in the last few years substantial lower than obviously the growth here, but it was healthy growth. I do not know what it is done in the last six months to nine months, but it has continued to be reasonably solid and we are quite comfortable that it will continue to grow. Particularly, we believe that we will be able to expand that market as we approach it in market, promote our products in a very different way to Red Bull, which is the market leader there.
Unidentified Analyst: Then give a sense for sales potential for Hitman may be even as a percentage of your sales and how do you think of that.
Rodney Sacks: We really do not know. That is a category that is so small, it started. It started to get some impetus. A lot of the major energy drink companies have all entered into that segment. So everybody entered it, and so it became a bit flooded. One of the challenges, is, how the way you put this shots, when there is one little box sitting on the counter it is easy for convenience store. Now you have got six or eight brands out there and you got some of the main brands there. So we think that there is going to be some evolvement of where it is, how they get marketed, where they get put on the shelves, and then we would have to see, ultimately, whether the consumer base for them actually broadens, I think that if this market has to really have any significance, you would have to have some basically cannibalization from we think the regular energy drink consumers who would prefer to try and get their energy boost, but act with this volume for whatever reason. So we do believe it is going to grow, but we believe that it is still going to be a niche with energy category. Category has got good margins, so that is positive for the company. We all do have plans to extent, and have indicated the deadline, and we may extend it further, going into 2009, when we get a better read and feel for them all. So it is very premature, but we are giving some sale through and at the moment it does seem to be incremental and not completely cannibalizing, but we do not know we will have to see how that evolves in the next two or three quarters.
Unidentified Analyst: Then, I apologize if I missed this but were the name drivers for the higher risk margin at present?
Rodney Sacks: I think the main driver was really just again as we got a mix and I think we have been able to just get some better margin in products like the shops and generally just probably a higher product mix between Java Monster and Monster in that quarter than perhaps in some of the previous quarters.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you very much.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Kaumil Gajrawala with UBS.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: Hi, thank you.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: First, as you think about the markets in the United States where you are going to be transitioning the CCE, could you talk a little bit about where you believe CCE would be able to offer incrementally, maybe such recent channels whatever it is, talk about what is behind some of the transition in the US markets?
Rodney Sacks: Well, obviously we believe that on an overall basis CCE has a very extensive network of salesmen, merchandisers, trucks and a very professional selling organization behind them. They have got very deep reach; they reach a large number of additional accounts that have not really been available to us through an alcoholic system, because in many cases they just do not go to the same universe of accounts. There are many areas in the US where there are dry areas or the alcoholic and non-alcoholic systems do not line up. So for all those reasons, we believe that in those areas, where we have made transitions. We are getting a very strong distribution partner. Now is some cases, we were doing very well and our previous distributors had built up strong market shares for us and a lot of them have been smaller distributors or entrepreneurial, they did a very good job. So in small instances, you may find that you may not get a big uplift but if you take the overall area and territory that has been transitioned and then you take the overall territory that is now left in the analyzable system, you do have the best of two strong systems and you have, one of the best, but you have two strong systems, each of slightly different strengths and we just believe that with both systems we will have the real opportunity to maximize our distribution and penetration in the markets that each of these respective systems are now charged with distributing the product and with the additional manpower behind it and additional points of sale that we will reach in additional tops of outlets, we believe that we will, on a overall basis benefit the brand in the longer term.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: Then just to clarify it. It is your decision to where you are in transition and not transition and 100% your?
Rodney Sacks: Yes, but obviously this was subject initially to negotiation with Coca-Cola before we entered into the agreement and mapped out, in general terms, where we would be transitioning there have been a number of instances, where they have been changes to that because of different factors. Where there have been changes, as we have gone forth that has been necessitated and basically, nothing domestic, pretty much in shape now and it is in the course of now being implemented.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: Then, if I could move on, without talking, maybe about your business but clearly gas prices have come down fairly quickly, have you already seen a step up in traffic in to these stores?
Rodney Sacks: I can not answer that, we just do not have that information.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: Okay. Then last question on international. I respect that you have done quite a bit already in terms of planning up sponsorships but it looks you will be rolling up faster than you could perhaps initially we had planned when you first lined down these sponsorships. Now that you are going through the CCE, so should we be expecting a bit of step up to some degree in marketing?
Rodney Sacks: Not really. We think what we are doing translated not only into the UK but of course Europe and so, to some measure, what we did this year was really preparatory for going in to Europe and really sometimes it is not what like the US, where you can take a national, if you only once taken the US, you had an athlete that was no national, he is going to get you the benefit across the whole, the US naturally what happens there. A lot of their competitions are not focused on one single country. So while some athletes were very much country focused, the majority of the athletes and programs that we conclude or will have to perform and compete an event situated different countries around Europe, they are shown on TV around Europe. So we are not going to change that marketing very much. We are going to re-look at, we are going to revisit what we got sure, we will be stepping up in, but where will step up more marketing in the individual countries as and when as we go into those countries and look for local athletes, local events, local promotions that are more meaningful to those countries. That we will be more tied to way we get to the country. So it as though just because we are in a more country than we had initially, we are going to splash up more money on marketing. We think that is going to be more inline effect. We probably spent more thus, in the area than we will far more per case than we anticipate we will be spending in 2009.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: Okay, good, that is useful. That sounds like no F1 cars in the near term?
Rodney Sacks: No.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: Thank you.
Rodney Sacks: Thanks.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We will take our next question from Alex Paterson with RCM.
Alex Paterson - RCM: Yes, Rodney. I just wanted to clarify the DSD net sales if you back out international, US looks like it was up 10%, does that sound about right for Q3?
Rodney Sacks: I do not know if you back out international because international includes Canada, includes Mexico, I think the numbers on DSD are pretty much up closer, just our full service; sales to full service distributors are up probably closer to 20%. So I do not believe that that figure is right. I think that is higher than that, but just sitting here I can not give you an answer on that figure.
Alex Paterson - RCM: Okay. We are going to circle back on that. Then the warehouse group was up and I still thought the WIC contract which I know was not necessarily going to loose all those sales but they were going to change that. Was warehouse better than expected for any particular reason?
Rodney Sacks: What happened was, while the WIC contract terminated, the WIC contract did continue for apple juice on a non-exclusive basis, but we have continued to see some decent volumes of apple juice even after termination of that contract. Where we did not continue was in the juice blends. That category where we originally had a juice blend category was terminated by WIC and juice blend does continue of to qualify. So we saw a fall off in the juice blend side of the business on that side. Overall, we ended up I think, as we have indicated, higher than in the warehouse division than in the previous quarter.
Alex Paterson - RCM: I mean is there any reason to think because of the nature of the business going forward that we should expect that to be running below recent trends or should we take this quarter as a fair seasonally adjusted run rate for what warehouse should be doing.
Rodney Sacks: I do not believe I can give you an answer on that, Alex.
Alex Paterson - RCM: Yes. Okay.
Rodney Sacks: Now that is as far as getting into the projections and into the guidance which we really do not give.
Alex Paterson - RCM: Well, actually I am sorry. What I was trying to understand is, what the changes you did make in the WIC contracts and the way they have turned out to play out the bottom line is we should presume that there is been a step function down in the sales potential of that division given the way Q3 played out?
Rodney Sacks: That is correct. As a slight up we have actually been able to probably make up as much of the loss that we have in juice blends, is really what you are saying, with continued sales of juices and we have had some increases in our tetra pack business, the safety pack business, and so that is helped that business
Alex Paterson - RCM: Okay, all right, that helps. I have been trying to get a handle on the fourth quarter, Rodney, because of last years give or take $20 million of load and you tried to highlight how that A, does that seem like a fair number that we should be using in terms of turn it back that out of fourth quarter, and then what play does that have on the operating margins, as obviously last year's $20 million extra created a lift over to expense structure and this year we wont' have it, obviously with CCE and all that is going to make difference but just underline all that, can you give us framework for understanding how the fourth quarter plays out relative to last year.
Rodney Sacks: I really I do not think that we are in a position to give you any guidance on that. We have a quota that is subject to a substantial changeover in our distribution system very extensively. We have had volumes from Coke. We have got return of inventory. In an ideal world, they should equal each other but each of these different distributors are going to have different criteria of how much inventory they want to have on their floors at any one time. We have got to see when that actually comes through the company. We are obviously looking at just managing the business, the $21 million last year of volume, we understand did this to topple the last year situation but the business is solidified. We also are waiting to see how the category does, generally the economy does. So it is very difficult for me to give you guidance and really we just do not that and particularly this quarter is more difficult than any other quarter.
Alex Paterson - RCM: Right, Rodney. I perfectly understand that. Perhaps a better read on last year's fourth quarter, the degree to which the $21 million created any artificial lift on margins because it was more than a normal quarter because of that load in. Is that a fair read or were the margin fairly representative of the business without the load in.
Rodney Sacks: Again, I think it is unfair for me to try and categorize that because there was a lift, roughly $21 million we estimated for the increase was a combination of 16 ounce which was pretty much our entire product range in Monster. Also, there was a large price increase in Java Monster and it was higher, it was about 12% or 13% versus a 6% or 7% increase in Monster. Now how much of that increase was of Java Monster and that just perhaps a little disproportionate, there is a bigger bind of increase of that or not which more than offset that margin, I do not know. So we are just not in a position to say to you we think that the margin structure is good or bad. What we can say to you is that going forward, this year, we have historically what has really happened is that we have been able to improve the margin, I think, this quarter. We think that we have got Java Monster has as a percentage of sales is a little lower. 24 ounce is a little lower in the Monster mix and those are the two lines that have smaller, lower margins. At the fourth quarter this quarter this year, we will have some sales and some higher margin sales from the energy shooters. So those are factors that are going to influence the quarter and more than that I just can not give you any more indication. We are also at the fourth quarter going to be affected by the accounting for termination cost and deferred revenue. Those, again, have to be backed in and out. So there is just a number of moving targets in this quarter.
Alex Paterson - RCM: Okay. Rodney, I appreciate that but lastly just the international sales, as you are expanding them through CCE, should these be margin accretive, neutral, dilutive over the time?
Rodney Sacks: We think that there will probably there will be a slight decrease in margins from margins overseas that seems to be the trend because of crossing their higher cost of doing business, higher cost of our distribution arrangements and the route to market. So, overall, at this point in time, it seems to us, in the countries we have gone in to that we will have a lower margin then we have enjoyed in the US. Also there will be a big factor on foreign currency, as you know, whereas up to couple of weeks back, the dollar is weak the currencies were strong which helped us. That swung in the last couple of weeks ago and so that will also start having an affect on us going forward but at this time, it is not. It is just too premature for us to be able to assess that.
Alex Paterson - RCM: Lastly, the December meeting.
Rodney Sacks: The December meeting, we are planning to have a December meeting, update meeting to stockholders. It will be, I think, the date is around about the December 16, and it will be held in New York at which, investors will be invited, which we will be honored to attend.
Alex Paterson - RCM: All right, thanks very much, Rodney.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you.
Operator: We will take a follow up from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Hi, Rodney. A couple of follow up questions with respect to the agreement with the Coke system. First, is there any opportunity to move your manufacturing out of your co-packers and move that into the Coke system and perhaps help your gross margin from that perspective?
Rodney Sacks: That is something that is just too premature for us to discuss at this point in time. There is always opportunity but that is something we will be considering as we go forward, and we will be holding some discussions with Coke and where we believe it is appropriate we would consider adding some Coke facilities to our production network but at this point in time we are continuing to produce through our existing network at the full. Again, this is something we all looking at. It is been evaluated.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Then my understanding is that this more of a long-term agreement, something like a 20-year an agreement, and I am just wondering logic of entering into this long-term relationship and what actions or what do you have in place that may limit the risk of consumers buying another energy brand, or then developing their own organic energy plan and perhaps that takes attention away from your brand.
Rodney Sacks: We think we have safeguard build into the agreements to protect the amount of focus and attention that our brands will get. There are certain limitations on what the distribution partners will be able to distribute. We are pretty comfortable. We do not think that there is any real, major difference between this arrangement and Anheuser-Busch relationship in principle. The two relationships are reasonably similar and we believe that they both will be beneficial for the company. As we said, we do have safeguards that we do have build into to obviously ensure that we do not get locked into a system that is not performing or is not giving us a fair amount of attention. It is up to us provide that they give products on to the shelf and perform their distribution functions efficiently, which is all weaken, it is up to us to undertake the global branding for the brand and to make sure that brand remains exciting and get pulled off the shelf. Provided we do our job, we believe that the distribution arrangements will continue to be positive for us on a long term basis, both with the IB system and with the Coke system.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: So it would be fair to assume that the most of the terms in the agreement whether it is a margin structures or exit terms are relatively similar in this instant versus your prior agreement?
Rodney Sacks: I think they are relatively similar to the IB arrangements.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference and concludes the question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rodney Sacks for any additional closing remarks.
Rodney Sacks.: Thank you. Just in closing, the fourth quarter is a period of transition for us. It is quiet a extensive transition that we are going through as a company and we obviously are very focused on that. We are also focused on getting the transition in place in the UK, and then ultimately, getting the products established in the CCE system in the additional countries. so we believe we got a lot of work on our hands going forward, but we believe that this will ultimately be very beneficial to the brand and for the long-term growth, not only in the US, but also internationally for the brand. So we are pretty excited about the arrangements that we have been able to conclude and as we go forward, we think that 2009 will be a very exciting year for the company. Thank you very much. We have to be in position to give the investors a further update when we have our interim investor conference in New York in mid-December and thank you for your support. Thank you very much.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference, we appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2008 Q2  (2008-08-08 18:00:00) =====
Executives: Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and CEO Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, CFO, COO and Secretary
Analysts: Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus Gregory Badiskanian - Citigroup Alex Paterson - RCM
Operator: Good day, everyone and thank you for joining today's Hansen Natural Corporation's Second Quarter 2008 Financial Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'd like to turn the conference over to Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Rodney Sacks. Please do ahead sir.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is Rodney Sacks speaking. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, he is with us today as is Tom Kelly, our Vice President of finance. Firstly, I would like to thank you for attending the call and at this time, I would like to record that certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues and profitability. Management cautions that these statements are qualified by their terms, or important factors many of which are outside the control of the company that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from the statements made herein. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. At the onset, I would like to apologize, I understand there was some delay in our results being transmitted across the wires and through the internet and this was due to circumstances beyond our control. They were released on yesterday, but that was apparently summing that just occurred... there were tremendous amount of other companies also reporting results at the same time after the close today. But I understand that both the release has now gone across the internet and the 8-K has also been filed and has gone across the internet. Our results for the quarter underscore our ability to continue delivering growth in both sales and profits despite the challenging macro economic environment in the United States. During the quarter, almost all categories of ready to drink beverages in the United States experienced weakness. This weakness is most pronounced in convenience store cold drink channels, where the vast majority of energy drinks are sold. We continue to believe that the moderating growth we have seen in energy drinks appears in part due to the challenging macro economic environment and the resulting decline in store traffic, primarily in the C&G sector, especially in Southern California. We have seen a noticeable fall off in sales all for example, our 24-ounce sized packages in Southern California, which is consistent with the above. Although our sales of regular and low-carb Monster Energy Drinks increased, as did their respective market shares. In fact, I'm proud to report that according to latest Nielsen's, Monster Energy and 16-ounce cans i.e. our Green Monster is now the highest selling item in the energy category in the United States. And our low-carb Monster Energy in 16-ounce cans is also now the best selling low carb or diet item in the energy category in the United States. This is a remarkable milestone that we've achieved in overtaking the leading Redbull item in the category. According to AC Nielsen, for the 13 weeks ended June the 28, 2008 all outlets combined, convenience, grocery, drug and mass excluding Wal-Mart, the energy category as defined by Hansen Natural, grew by 13.7% over the comparable period in 2007. Monster sales increased 42.5%, while its market share increased to 28.3% from 22.6% last year, and also increased from 26.9% at the end of the first quarter of 2008. Red Bull's sales increased by 11.3%, while its market share decreased to 35.7% from 36.5% last year and 37.3% at the end of the first quarter of 2008. It is noteworthy that Rockstar sales decreased by 0.7 of a percent and its market share decreased to 10.8% from 12.4% in the previous year and from 11% at the end of the first quarter of 2008. Pepsi's Amp sales increased by 59.9%, primarily due to the introduction of new SKUs and expanded distribution. Amp's market share increased to 7.9% from 5.6% a year earlier. However, Pepsi's No Fear and Adrenaline Rush brands both locked substantial market share and are now down to 1.8% and 1.4% market shares respectively. Finally, Coke's Full Throttle brand sales decreased by 16% and its market share decreased to 4.8% from 6.5% last year. However, its NOS energy brand increased its market share to 2.6% from 1.1% last year, also largely due to new SKUs being introduced and expanded distribution. I would like to refer to the growth rates on some of the individual items. What is important to us for example, in looking and assessing the strength of a brand is to look at for example the main or fledge of SKU. In the case of Monster 16-ounce Green Energy, the main brand grew 16% in convenience and gas and it sales point grew 6.7%. When compared with the leading Red Bull 8 or 12-ounce sizes, the Red Bull 8-ounce size can product dropped sales dropped 14.6% versus last year and on a sales per point, also dropped 14.6%. Their 12-ounce pack dropped size can product dropped 8% in dollar sales and 19.6% on a sales per point basis. The leading Rockstar products dropped... energy drink in 16-ounce cans dropped 11.3 percentage points versus last year and it sales on a sales per point basis dropped 7.4%. Amp, which has seen an increase in the sales for the brand however they are leading SKU, their flagship product drop... was up only 5.3 points in the sales and on a sales per point basis were down 2.3%. Full Throttle, leading product is down 10.6% in sales and on a sale per point down 9.4. Even NOS, which is a brand which was up substantially on sale due to the increased distribution primarily is up at 134% increase in sales in aggregate, but on a sales per point dropped 20.7%. When compared against admission against our competitors, you can see that the Monster Energy drink has continued to show positive growth both in sales and growth per point. And as we indicate earlier is now the leading item in the energy category. Club store sales of energy drinks has generally been up around the county but California has seen a decrease in sales in percentages across all brands, certainly there also appears to have been a drop of in-sales in some of the independent stores in the U.S. again, particularly focused in California. So those non-measured channels appear to have been more severely impacted by economic conditions, particularly in California. Sales of Java Monster represent approximately 10% of the total sales of the Monster brand, which is lower than about 16% that it represented in the first quarter. I will also point out that in the sales number that have been released, sales in the six-month period were negatively impacted by the buying at the end of 2007, ahead of the price increase and we estimate that was between up 3% to 4% of the total sales for the six-month period. I think that is probably... is that correct?
Unidentified Company Representative: I think it's a little bit more like 21 million over 280.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: You just check that it is for the six months sales, six months period. I'll just get that confirmed, I apologize. Sales to retail grocery decreased from 8% to 7.2% and sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers decreased from 14.3% to 14.2%, or sales full service distributors increased from 73.1% to 73.8%. So sales through distributors decreased from 1.8% to 1.5% while other sales were flat. International sales for the second quarter were nearly 6% compared to 4.8% last year. Gross sales outside of California increased from 72.8% last year to 76.5% this quarter. In the DST division, sales outside of California represent 81.1% of that divisional sales, up from 77.9% last year. Gross sales to customers outside of the United States increased from $13.4 million to $19.5 million. In the first six months of 2008, we experienced increased cost of certain raw materials, principally apple juice concentrate, aluminum cans and sugar, which had a greater impact on the warehouse segment than the DST segment. Although dairy prices were lower, at the end of the quarter, we did start to see higher diary cost coming through. We believe that dairy cost will increase in the second half of the year, although we still believe that the gross profits that we are able to generate from our Java Monster product in the second half of the year will be higher than we were able to achieve during the last year. We're also hopeful that apple juice concentrate prices will come down during the second half of this year. The figure I did give you earlier is correct for the impact on the volume. Turning to the balance sheet, I pointed out that outstanding receivables stood at 28.4 days at June 30, down from 28.7 days in December and 33.9 days last year. Inventory was $123.2 million, up from $98.1 million at December. The increase in inventory is primarily attributable to increased raw materials and finished products of Monster and in particular Java Monster. And this was to ensure that we were able to meet demands during our peak selling season. Average days of inventory was 82 days at June 30, 2008, which is higher than the 73 days of inventory at December 31, 2007 and 68 days at June 30, 2007. We hold auction rate securities having a face value of $129.8 million at June 30, 2008. There were $207.5 million at March 31, 2008 that had experienced failed auctions. Additional redemptions amounting to $8.9 million were received by us in July. These securities continue to accrue interest at the contractual rights until their respective auctions either to succeed or they are redeemed. Based on our availability to excess cash and other short term investments and our expected operating cash flows, we do not anticipate that the current lack of liquidity of these investments will have a material effect on our liquidity or working capital. We're continuing to make progress internationally. Sales in the second quarter in the United Kingdom increased to some $1.9 million. Total losses attributable to the United Kingdom start-up operations were $2 million in the first quarter and about $3 million in the second quarter, due largely to FPs and event sponsorships incurred during the quarter. We are continuing to secure additional listings for our product and as sales levels improve, the trading losses that we have incurred in the United Kingdom to date will be reduced. Obviously, the sponsorships were focused on the second quarter because that was the story to get into summer in the United Kingdom which has a short summer season and that's when we were focused on that. These start up costs... basically, if when taken into account with respect to our results, had an impact of about $0.03 all together on our results, approximately $1 million in the first quarter... sorry, $0.01 in the first quarter and $0.02 in the second quarter. So if one looks at our sales, our results on a percent basis, we believe that it should be factored in our results, these are one-off [ph] costs and obviously as we as we go forward we believe that we will achieve profitability reasonably quickly and then we will make up those costs. But for assessment proposes and other purposes, even those numbers should be taken into... factored into account. We... subsequent to the end of the quarter, we commenced selling Monster Energy drinks in Sweden and Spain and we expect to commence sales of Monster Energy in Ireland in the next few weeks. We are continuing to make progress in South Africa, where we are securing additional listings and sales are increasing. Our sales both in Canada and Mexico continue to improve and we are continuing to gain market share in both of these countries. On the Hansen Natural side, we are continuing with the roll out of our 40 beverages in 10.5 ounce sleek cans. Gross sales for July were approximately $11.3 million some 20% higher than gross sales in July 2007. Sales of Monster and Java Monster in July were approximately 21.5% higher than last year. We are continuing to make progress in the on premise channel. The securing of the South West Airlines account was a great achievement for the company and we have now managed to secure the availability of Monster on a regional airline. We continue to see strong growth in the on premise channel with over 3000 accounts now selling Monster. Last quarter being the total number out there selling Monster to more than 14,000 on premise accounts. We have seen the emergence of a small niche for energy shots in small size containers approximately 2 ounce sizes. These products are usually placed on check out counters in convenience stores and are very much an impulse purchase. As sales of these products have continued to increase, we decided to launch a Monster Hitman energy shooter in a 3 ounce size container which is a black container. We completed... have competed the formulation and the design of the product and anticipate launching Hitman later this quarter. We are also planning to launch certain new additional lines of Monster energy products before the end of the year but it would be premature and not appropriate for us to divulge further details in this regard at this time. In conclusion I reiterate that we remained extremely excited by the strength of the energy category in the current economic environment. We believe that the economy will stabilize in the near future and when consumer confidence is restored, the energy category will rebound and continue its growth trajectory ahead of that of traditional beverages and other categories which we believe will continue to reflect positively for the company. We are continuing to evaluate other opportunities internationally and to place additional resources behind the expansion of Monster internationally. Additionally we are test marketing a new product non-carbonated enhanced water under the trade... brand name of Hydration in selected markets in Southern California and as and when we are able to measure the results of that brand in those channels, we'll consider rolling out the brand more widely and will keep investors updated with respect to the roll out at our interim conference call. I will now open the floor to question. Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We'll go first to Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Hello everyone.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi Judy.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: When I look at your sales number. For the quarter it was up 15.5%. When you gave us the April number on the last conference call it has been running up 29%. So it implies that the sales numbers still down pretty dramatically in May and June and then it sounds like a picked up to about 20% in July. So can you just walk us through what happened in May and June and then what we think is driving the improvement in July?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: There was a slowdown in June, you were correct and there was a slowdown in May. So you didn't get the months right which was quite... quite substantial. It then picked up in June and it has picked up further in July. You know why the reason for that, I simply... we don't know.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay and then just sort of trying to again reconcile some of the Nielsen numbers that you have given us versus the gross sales number that you are reporting, it seems like disconnects seems to be getting bigger. It looks like in the Nielsen number shows 42% or something like that, it increased for Monster and again your gross sales numbers was much lower than that and that gap seems to be widening in more recent quarters. So do you have an explanation in terms of why do you think that the gap seems to be widening in the... in the Nielsen numbers versus what you're reporting?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We don't have an explanation. We've obviously noted that... that... that gap, the Nielsen numbers are an extrapolation of actual sales out of retail outlets. We obviously only... can only work on our sales numbers and shipments into our distributors, and from them, into... to retailers. They're all major channels. These are the measured chain channels. There is a large number of independent stores that... that basically starting to sell out product. They aren't measured by Nielsen. There are also a number of... unmeasured channels, for example, the club stores, and we know that club stores which have traditionally been large purchasers of our products, and you know, and do have a substantial business in the energy drink sector, have clearly seen some falloff in their sales, nationally, although they are still up nationally. Generally that is our understanding, except for California. We understand club stores generally throughout California have all been severely impacted by the economic downturn and are all showing negative numbers for energy in California, and that is not only attributable to... to the best we were able to ascertain, not only to our brand, but also to the other brands that they stock. It's a little more difficult for us. We were able to give information over here about our brand, but the... the club stores don't directly share the information with regard to the competitive brands, but as I've said, from what we've been able to glean from... from those chains, all of their brands are down similarly. So that is one of the... the reasons that we've seen a difference between Nielsen and our own sales numbers. But other than that we did obviously believe that for a period of time there was quite extensive de-stocking going on throughout the U.S. just people putting in their belts and just making sure they had less inventories on hand. We would have thought expect to that to have worked through the system now and that is all we can say. All we know is that we look at the numbers of Neilson which are measuring actual ring through but at the same time, they... it is an extrapolation from a selected number of sample of stores and we have no other... we're continuing to sell our products to the same distributors, to the same stores in the same way. But, that is the only explanation we can give. We measure ourselves through from Neilson but we always look our own sale but we all, as we've indicated, we're seeing a pick up in sales and when you look at the sales of Monster within the company they are north of 20%. So you know that's the only explanation we can give to you on in that regard.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay, and then if I look at your operating expenses as a percent of sale it looks like it declined pretty substantially from the first quarter even though you've started to incur even more startup cost in Europe. So can you just explain some of the factors that drove the sequential decline from first quarter to second quarter in terms of the SG&A expenses?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I think a part of that was driven by you have to back out the, that is only cost relating to distributed terminations and, the legal fees et cetera. And I think that had an impact, I don't think that on a sequential basis we would have, if you take that impact out that there would be a substantial decline.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay, last question on Java you said the mixed decline sequentially to 10%. Can you talk about the competitive landscape obviously you've seen more products coming to the marketplace. What's happening from a competitive standpoint and Java's ability to get more shelf basis?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: So I just got back before just to the other question, I'm just looking at some of those numbers now for first quarter on, if you take some of those other numbers out. And basically we are not seeing a decline sequentially either in distribution or all the SG&A and payroll are all basically up, inline with increased sales and increased marketing. So I think that effected just because of that you got to backup those other extraordinary expenses.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: If I look at numbers in the first quarter your operating expenses up 57%. You back out those numbers and it looks like this quarter was up close to 25%?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: But then you pricing that also previous year.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Right.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: That I cannot tell you, I cannot tell you why the difference was but I mean it's I cannot answer that question for you sitting here. Sorry. Your other questions Judy?
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: On Java and what's happening to the competitors landscape and?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We are just seeing that there has been a lot of other brands that have jumped into the market and what we do seem to be seeing is sort of a [indiscernible] slowing down in consumer demand for the energy plus coffee sort of category. The actual category is continuing to grow. We are seeing the actual coffee category growing at quite a healthy rate according to the Nielson for coffee. But there is a there is a lot of more competition and obviously we are also able to increase Monster more so as a percentage we just seeing a moderation there and we think that may continue going forward.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay.
Operator: Our next question is from Kaumil Gajrawala with UBS
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: Hi, thank you.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: First question if you can gives an update on promotional activity including... internal activity to the degree in Southern California then what it was like national?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Promotional activity we did at the end of last quarter approximately we saw that the whole category in California I had was down a couple of points so, we obviously took steps to look at the market to see what was happening and we did address the market through promotions and through more focused activity on our earn sales and distributors efforts in the market. But other than that we've not particularly end mode [ph] promotional activity in California in preference to anywhere else. Most of all, promotional activity costs already related to the shelf programs that we've been introduced across the country to order to secure shelf space for our products and as well as sponsorships endorsements etcetera those cost similarly or simply in a determined by athletes and events wherever they may take place. So there is no geographic limitation. Sponsorships have gone up cost of actually securing a sponsorship and athletes have increased what I refer to that on previous occasions that the cost of doing business with athletes in that extreme sports fight has gone up. But we all continuing to obviously use that as our promotion. We obviously looked at spending money in that area with the sort of little fall of that we've experienced in the energy category and beverage sales in general. That line of customers to as a percentage little higher than we had initially budgeted for. But we were committed obviously to a lot of the marketing and the promotional steps for the year which we believe was it was so important for us to continue with both from a brand point of view and from a competitive point of view. We're looking at the competitive landscapes. So they are pretty much inline with where we're what we have planned. Where the cost had increased in that item were the sponsorships of events and athletes in the United Kingdom. Will did have reply quite of big role in the, in our actual consolidated sponsorship line item which did increase. And so if you back that are those cost out which are extraordinary to the US operations and they are more inline with what we had anticipated.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: Okay. And just to as there we think of the back half year, given the starting [ph] these that you spend when you are first rolling out jobs on incremental starting is enough spending [inaudible] base to reconsider it by now versus what is looking back in the first half of year?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Change you minds.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: give a sense.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I think that which will be pretty much continue on the level we have seen them now in this quarter.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Secretary: This really affects the net sales.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: And last question on inventories I think they are barely steadily been increasing, is it preparation of a roll out into these international markets or is it that the macro situation in?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I think it's been a macro situation. We did obviously have some build up of inventories both here and overseas for the U.K. launch in order to assure we have products. So we ran some production as well. We also didn't want to be faced with an out of stock situation which although we didn't know we had sort of paid it, it could have bumped with just as it happened it leveled off. But that because the reason there is limited production and there is a longer lead time to get that production we decided to build up the inventory rather to insure that we had inventories, depending on where the sales went. So we did that we have the inventory and we are now sort of working down through it it's its fine there's no problem with it, its good inventory and we are just work ourselves through it and adjust ourselves going into second half of the year.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: Okay thank you very much.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Secretary: Thank you.
Operator: Over to next Mark Astrachan with Stifel Nicolaus.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Good afternoon, guys.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good afternoon, Mark.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: First question just relating to your views on brand equity and pricing. I know we talked about this in the past, but given this success of the Monster brand and the equity it enjoys in category, have you given more thought to taking pricing at year end not necessarily to the same degrees as you did at the prior end but basically in line with some of the concentrate producers do outside the energy category, simply because it can do it, because you enjoy brand equity?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We are really not looked to in that sense, we think that it's still premature for us. [Indiscernible] something we can introduce reasonably quickly if we feel that that's justified. We think we need to wait a few more months just see the general direction of where the economy is going. We obviously anticipate pricing going up in things like raw materials, cans, and then sugar and possibly in dairy a little bit. But we think we need to get a better handle on the extent of that and what impact will have on us before we increase process. I think that is something that is on our mind. That is definitely on the agenda would be a convenient time to do it at the end of the year. But we haven't made up our mind completely as to whether we will and if so to what extend.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Great. And then in terms of thinking about the cost environment, you have done a pretty good job of managing those costs particularly on the DST side of the business are there anything, any inputs there that are particularly concerning or anything that may change a bit more than we've seen in the past towards is it kind of steady as you go there?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No. I think that early news that inline with everybody would wait and see what happens to world aluminum process that might have an impact on can process going forward.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Secretary: Sugar.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sugar as well but I think the main things is really more can process where we're not sure we all as we said we are expecting some increase in the dairy component of Java but we don't believe that it will be anywhere near what we had last year. But we'll have to pay that... show me that fluctuates from month to month.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Great. And then in terms of your usages of cash you spent about 50 million to buyback stock in quarter. One is, should we expect that sort of trend to continue going through the balance of the year and then secondly have you given any thought to doing other things with your cash positions like special dividends or anything else like that?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We think that in fact, we believe that if anything we should be buying back our stock with the cash. Certainly to leave constrain as to when we can buy stock and we are pretty sensitive to having any sort of information of a creative or any nature that might be, have any perception of additional specialist knowledge and certainly [Ph] to that we do believe and or taken decision to back our stock quite aggressively but again that will be subject to legal advises to when we are in the position to do so and we propose to do so particularly at these gross levels
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: And will that include potentially extending any share re purchase commitment?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I can't speak for the Board but yes, it's my personal give yes it would.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Well that's good to hear and then just a final question on comparisons with the third quarter on a month by month basis. Am I correct in remembering that the quarter gets easier as we go in particular I think September comparisons from last year were troubling. There was some slow down in trends there so it should be getting easier as we go through the quarter?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I don't know. Pretty much you would... maybe able to expect later, it would maybe logical. We are still facing an economy where there is lot of uncertainty and there is an impact clearly on the buying patterns of consumers. I think we're continuing to see more and more retail and other customer valves coming through with showing reductions in foot traffic and reductions in purchases. And so we just don't know what impact that will ultimately have. Obviously we also continue to ramp up then we have the additional job at Monster sales that took place last year, while we were securing distribution. So that was pretty erratic because we introduced it we sort of had some availability issues and so sales drop then we are able to more supply then sales reduced. I don't in which months I don't know sitting here what that match was but that will play a part in our numbers going forward. But we feel we are starting to settle down and we are seeing some increased back in our own sales numbers and we think that as the economy sort of just stabilizes and people lose the shell shock of the higher gas prices and things that definitely help. That obviously doesn't answer the weakness the macro economy but from a gas price point of view we think that things will start settling down a little bit as people get more used to these prices that are just going to probably become a way of life for us.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. Thanks Guys.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Greg Badiskanian with Citigroup.
Gregory Badiskanian - Citigroup: Great, thanks. I just have a few quick questions. Can you maybe talk a little bit about how the core Monster product is doing X job in more mature markets? You mentioned California slowdown, are there some other markets that you'd look at, to kind of... kind of look at that growth, and do you have some numbers around that? I didn't mean to put you on the spot if you or just maybe just sort of anecdotally if you can, directionally tell us?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, anecdotally according to Nielson, basically we're saying that if you take Java out of the mix, the didn't take it out of the category growth. For example, convenience and gas, we off sold Monster without Java its still increased sales, is substantially higher than the category growth.
Gregory Badiskanian - Citigroup: Great.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Both in excel sales and in sales per point. So the brands on it's own, it's clearly still ahead of the category, and still substantially ahead of basically of all the major competitors, it's substantially ahead of rock stars, red bull sales and rock star which in fact negative. If you take their job out of their products as well. So we are continuing to see solid sales in the core brand and that's what I referred to anyone the real ultimate cool product is your original work horse your flagship, Monster Green Energy 16 Ounce, single serve, and that is now the leading item in the energy category. And that's continuing to grow both in actual dollars and in sales... in dollar sales per point.
Gregory Badiskanian - Citigroup: I'm sorry, I missed the first part of the call. Did you give numbers around that?
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Secretary: Yes. Yes. We did..
Gregory Badiskanian - Citigroup: Okay, I'll listen to... I'll read the transcript.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Jus to give you the one marker, I just have to pick out the Los Angles market, you can take Monster without in the 13 weeks ended June 28 you take Monster without Java Monster we were positive in that market both in actual sales and in sales per point.
Gregory Badiskanian - Citigroup: Okay. So it's positive--
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: This was compared to red bull which was zero which reflects and rock star which was down on both those areas, both those criteria.
Gregory Badiskanian - Citigroup: Right. And when you look at... you had mentioned that in terms of Java, can you remind me in terms of just the comparisons because you are ramping you very nice incremental sales growth last year from Java, when do you start to say its still bit tougher compares where Java was kind of... out there at full force at retail?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I think that we've still got a lot of work to do to get the additional SHUs for which we have a secured lot of shelf space in many types of that should have been implemented. We've seen reasonably good execution in the private, we've not yet seen really a full distribution of the Java Monster SKUs when you look at the actual your Java Monster SKUs on basically in the Nielsen number they drop up into the pretty much into the 20's very quickly.
Gregory Badiskanian - Citigroup: Yes.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: And so we see, although we have rolled it out and we've seen a sort of stable handling of Java we think that with some focus we should be able to get the distributions levels of these newer product up to plus 50 which will have a positive impact. But as regards last year, Java by the time we have got to about August we started to get to sales. July, August pretty much that we're closer to where we are achieving sales now.
Gregory Badiskanian - Citigroup: Okay.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: So that follow to get... there were some quite erratic in there was just a drop about in November and then it picked up again in December which were higher. So you... but if you take a sort of a moving average. it was much closer to where we are seeing, the average just now we are seeing some increase on it. But it is closer to where we are.
Gregory Badiskanian - Citigroup: Okay, alright. That's helpful. And then also just we would respect to your moderating sales growth which is still obviously doing a great job relative to the category. I mean we talk about it's a tough economy is that trading down and how much of its to may be just the category maturing, just when you look at the over all industry that to find out very significantly as well lately?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes we think that overall industry growth and lot of that we believe has is due to the macro environment. It's just been a sort of a regulate stud on as the environment is getting tougher and we see that should be more morphed in California where we perceive that the effect of the slow down has been more marked on consumers, on construction, on property and mortgage, it's just everything that hit California particularly Blue collar workers and which is a large part of our consumer. They're being hit more, they are going into the stores as much, they are not out there in convenient stores. So foot traffic and purchases particularly of our higher cost item is clearly impacted. By that and ultimately the pendulum does swing eventually and it turns so we believe that when that happens the energy category is stalled. We think one of the exciting categories of the beverage industry. And we think that this will be category that will rebound more quickly than the other traditional categories which has been flattened and we're decreasing before the environment started this for example the coordinated products.
Gregory Badiskanian - Citigroup: California may be a tough example to speak of that's all see your more mature markets you have two factors impacting it. May be another market that's where the economy is doing a little better and it's more mature but that might be helpful. At some point just to kind of get some info from you there and the moving over to Hitman, can you talk a little bit about that on emerging category the energy shock category and can I have that product is position and what the opportunity is, do you think it will be incremental sells will be cannibalization and may talked about that?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I think everybody competes for a share of stomach and that is an energy when I say that it is easy more traditional beverage. But in the energy category again you're getting consumers who are looking for an energy boost and then they will all clearly a percentage of consumers who whatever is an on, that first year, say will I need the energy boost but I don't necessarily need the liquid with it. And there are obviously becoming the consumers who are gyrating towards the energy shots. So at all, there is some cannibalization, there is competition, it must obviously take from the categories so when we really look at the category, we believe the correct way to look at it is as one large category, and energy shots all simply part of that category. Just as we saw 8 ounce energy drinks and we're now selling 24 or 32 ounces, this is just going the other way. So but we do see that category growing, it's an impulse purchase. Until now it's really been a little box on a sitting on the shelf of the convenient stores, we have seen convenient stores starting to design and change starting to design a racks to actually put because there are more competitors coming into the category that I have seen the product it is a high range for the convenient stores. So they are making good margin on it, so we see them designing racks and things where they can actually offer a selection of these products. They usually are sold bore doesn't necessarily mean that couldn't be somewhere getting him into the culture but they don't necessarily need to be because it is a small volume. We think it will remain a niche within the energy category. But it will be part of it and if it's part of it you know we don't see any reason why we shouldn't be playing in that category and be a part for that reason we took the decision. We sort of saw and wanted it to mature it to a sufficiently high level to justify the costs and focus of launching products and putting efforts and manpower behind it. We took the decision to enter that category and which we've done and we've designed the product. We have decided to go a little bit differently, we decided to increase the size to a three ounce serving. It's still a short, we call it a shoot out and basically we are going to roll that out pretty quickly. We think that will be incremental; it may be marginally... there will be some canalization but we think that it's at a good margin for us and it shouldn't result in a margin reduction.
Unidentified Analyst: The equal margin do you have products to stay?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It's an at least equal to our basically is equal to the maid amongst the lions. Yeah.
Unidentified Analyst: Great we will look forward to seeing that in the stores. Thanks.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: We go next to Alex Paterson with RCM.
Alex Paterson - RCM: Hey thanks for taking my question.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Alex Paterson - RCM: Rodney, I was just curious in getting back to the question Judy was asking about. Try and understand the dynamics between what is seen in retail numbers and what seems to be going on at the shipment level and the fact that the retailers and distributors are clearly under pressure, probably trying to work their working capital. They are more efficiently inventory down etcetera. Are you getting...do you have a dialogue with AB or any of the other larger distributors that provides you some feed back on maybe these stocking trends or anything to that effect?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We do have dialogs when we have talk with them but we've not been able to discern with any level of confidence what the reason is for the disconnect. We're knowing that they've been able to look to that has really pinpointed it and given us a comfort level to say okay we know what its I an if it is addressable in any way how we address that. We just basically a school fee the explanations of being destalking. explanations of that times are tough but we're not seeing any other reason for it and we just as I indicated we're very strong to coal [ph] we just don't know the difference or the reason for it. I mean we just we get the information, we have our own sales figures and what we're trying to put in together and may there is just a connected at the moment.
Alex Paterson - RCM: Understood I guess the key point there was a de-stocking can be short-term issue versus something that is clearly not. I gather at this point you just can't explain whether it is a short term issue or not?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No, just de-stocking technically should be shorter but it does take time. But we don't know whether that is the only explanation or what the reason is. Bit as of it what we have noticed is the larger purchases and the purchases coming out of say, club stores just selling full packs. They have clearly been a slowdown in that area.
Alex Paterson - RCM: Yeah, understood. So, just quickly there is couple of other things. The on premise you talked about as a percent of sales did you give that number...
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I didn't give a number for on premises as a percent of sales, no.
Alex Paterson - RCM: Is it material or is it getting anywhere?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: From a [indiscernible] perspective it's starting to get material but from a sales perspective it is still very small and that's a very still an expensive part of our business in order to achieve to get that business there are a lot of rebates, there're a lot of deals to basically lot of costs to get into that business. But I can't give you a figure of it. I don't have it handy on what we're selling there. But it's not material to the point that it will justify us breaking that out already starting to analyze that at this point.
Alex Paterson - RCM: Okay. The fourth quarter, when you have this... sorry--?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I missed out a factor that is an important factor is that we all are making headway, it is slow but it is getting out before have to been able to get to the level of 14,000 accounts with indebt with that debt clearly just hitting in a wrong direction and then it's pretty moving ahead with some momentum.
Hilton H. Schlosberg - Vice Chairman, President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Secretary: nconsistent and part from them would go challenge green
Alex Paterson - RCM: Understood, understood it's a build up process. The fourth quarter when you had a ship in of before the price increase, obviously that creates an artificially tough comparison and it's not clear that everybody has digested that notion. Is that a fair assessment of how we should look at the fourth quarter?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I don't think so. If your looking at comparisons, I think that you have really got to take the estimate of $20 odd million, $21 million we thought of in our off sales and it may have an impact a little more than that the deficit our base kits and actually when you factor that into just generally in the sales for the first six months that would be a fairer way to do it and we agree with it.
Alex Paterson - RCM: Okay and you mentioned a... maybe you'd have an analyst day one of these days getting ready for that?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We probably will do an analyst day probably the idea would be to probably do that towards the end of the year that's where we are planning to probably do something in early December mid December going back to New York and actually have a reasonably extensive day. We are all planning to continue the midst, quarterly updates and we have got it we are going to try and time those updates, at a time when we're able to also have these proceeds to the most recent Nielsen numbers. There was unfortunately the last time that happened we had the shelled meeting that we still felt obliged to have that update because we had indicated that to share holders and investors and but obviously it did not fall when I blast to do that that is why one of the reasons we would, have up to date, or more up to date. Nielsen numbers than we had already discussed at the shareholder meeting but going forward, mid theory of cold for the this kind of quarter we have to be in a position to be able to give an up-date on new sort of sea packs where the sales are going and where the economy is going
Alex Paterson - RCM: Okay and lastly I maybe... I know you do not talk about projections but so the degree you have seen or read or heard any major industry players or consultants regarding the front LRB market and energy drink grilled with in it, in these current economic times. Have you picked up any sort of commentary about expected growth rates for the category over the next few years?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No, no. The last we have talked, what is really been impacting every body is the uncertainty of how the general economy has been affecting energy drinks perhaps might be a little disproportionately to other drinks and so we have seen it flow down that is perhaps been greater than one would have anticipated but we believe that that will also reverse at that same pace but just talking to people, they're very much in the air. They simply don't know they still think that this is the growth category in the whole beverage industry. Even more than it haunts waters and we have the focus is on those two categories and that categories also slow dramatically I think the numbers that seem to have been published about that category and the bottom water resource sales that drop off has been even more amount than we have seen the energy category and just coming those higher price more sort of newer lines that we had to many this growth and they seem to be the drop of. But we thing that well stabilize and people are going to get back to looking to what is new, what is different, what is exciting, what is summing that motivate them to buy the beverage and believe that it's kind a pick up again and focus again on the energy category because we believe that is still the category that provides some new alternatives some in new, some in different and as product that performs to consumers.
Alex Paterson - RCM: Okay thanks very much for the time Ron..
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Pleasure thanks, Alex.
Operator: And your last question is from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Just following up the question about what is the long term outlook for the energy drink category and to the extent that we are in you know long period of consumer weakness in the US and the category really dozen pick up any time soon how much flexibility what is your willingness in terms of thinking about some of the suspending you know weather its sponsorship expenses or brand investment that you are you budgeting or you are thinking about doing at this point.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We are looking at that pretty closely we are looking at it literally on weekly basis we are looking at the discretionary spend because we do have historically been opportunistic in... we have about and we said, but we see a really good opportunity at a reasonable cost. We often have taken that opportunity and jumped on it very quickly, because that's been just the way we've started how we've done the business. And we're trying to introduce a little more constraint there because we think some of these deals aren't good, because again you can't go out and just spend and spend. At the same time, you don't want to end up starving your brand. We're building the brand for the long-term, the company for the long-term. And we don't want to be able to give up sometimes good properties or good athletes, and let them get... allow them to go by default to competitors, because we think that we will regret the day when it comes, next year when somebody else's got the rights to a particular event that we let past this year, that we couldn't get next year. That being said, we are looking very carefully at our sponsorships, we're looking at trimming maybe areas that are peripheral to the direct core groups that we are at, we're perhaps we were trying to extend the brand and obviously extend the consumer base, where we feel that there is some uncertainty as to the real payback in that area, we obviously those ones we will pull back. We will obviously be cautious about our sales, or as you can see, it ultimately in dollar terms the sales are continuing to increase and we obviously continue to... we need to continue to support the brand. But we will try and continue to marry our cost much more closely to our revenues. As we've indicated, the problem is sometimes that's a lot of these programs are basically are annual programs and you buy them and sign off on them yearly in advance and so the reaction time can't be quite as quickly. But we have already, I don't want to go into the detail of which one it is, but there is a particular program we have an option next year to extend it, and we... which was quite a high dollar amount, and we decided to put... we paused on it. So we will do that as we continue to go ahead and manage the brand, but we again I reiterate that we're not going to pull back, that's the wrong message on just virtuously [ph] on spending, we think that's a short term solution and not a long-term solution for the brand. On the other hand, we are trying to be responsible about it and not simply saying we are developing a brand at all costs and simply ignoring the bottom line, but we are trying to create a balance between the two.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then just a clarification, you talked about the soda cost in Europe. But any dilution in the first quarter $0.02 dilution in the second quarter. Are you basically saying we are pretty much done with those expenses or those losses?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I am not sure. I wouldn't... I think that the third quarter may see... maybe a small also coming from there. We are starting to see a lot of good listings, we are actually getting listings for the some of the big retailers, both in the grocery section, in the what they the call, the gas station section and in some of the independents. And we all starting to make some headway. But a lot of those listings are coming in the third quarter and are coming later in the year. So I am not sure what impact that sales will have. The result is we are... because we believe that marketing and promotional spend will be lower in the third quarter because a lot of the programs were took place and occurred in the second quarter, but there still will be some I think some loss coming through from the UK in the second quarter... third quarter, sorry. It will be helped by some of the sales that are now going through to distributors in Sweden, Spain and hopefully before the end of the quarter, we think Ireland as well. That will help us, but it maybe it will be reduced but it may be smaller. But certainly if I think by the fourth quarter we will hope to get into a more stable position in Europe.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Thank you.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Sacks for any additional closing remarks.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you. Just in closing, I just want to thank everybody for attending the call. This is... we are trading in difficult times. I think many people don't quite appreciate the extent I think of the difficulties that are facing the U.S. economy. We really do dissect a lot of the consumer product companies' results, I mean you focus on their North American divisions or businesses. Invariably, they are all negative and down. So, we believe that the achievement we've managed to achieve at this stage is very good. We are very happy with that, we are taking the steps to expand internationally. We have a number of other prospective countries in mind. We are going through and taking on the necessary stock to help support that expansion now. Rome wasn't built in a day. We believe we'll get there. We are looking at other ways to secure stronger distribution partners overseas. And you know the main message I want to give to investors is that our brand is really healthy, it's really strong. Despite all of this, we are continuing to take market share. We are now the leading brand in certain of our SKUs which is unbelievable and unbelievable achievement we think for the company. And we are continuing to grow, we are exciting new products on the drawing board. And so we've just believe in the long-term that our company and brand will continue to prosper and lead the growth in the energy category. And I just thank everybody for the support and we'll give everyone a further update when we have our interim conference call. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation and you may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good day everyone and thank you for joining today's Hansen Natural Corporation's First Quarter 2008 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Rodney Sacks. Please go ahead sir.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Good afternoon, this is Rodney Sacks speaking. I have Hilton Schlosberg, our President with us and Tom Kelly, our Controller, Vice President of Finance. Thank you for attending the call. At this time I’d like to record that certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues and profitability. Management cautions that these statements are qualified by their terms or important factors, many of which are outside of the control of the company that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from the statements made herein. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. As indicated in the announcement, gross sales for the 2008 first quarter increased 28.4% to $244 million from $190.1 million a year earlier. Net sales for the first quarter increased 27.9% to $212 million from $165.9 million a year ago. We estimate that both gross and net sales for the quarter were reduced by approximately 8% to 9% as a result of purchases made by customers in advance of the price increases effective January 1, 2008 for Monster Energy in 16-ounce cans and the Java Monster line. Net sales of the DST division increased 32.4% for the quarter, while the net sales for the Warehouse division decreased 0.4%. In the DST division sales attributable to Monster and Java Monster products increased 36.1% during the quarter, while sales of Energy, Juice, Unbound, and Lost were lower. In the Warehouse division, sales of apple juice and juice blends and tetra pack were higher, while sales of teas and Hansen's Energy were lower. Sales of 192-ounce case equivalents increased by 2.9 million cases or 15% from 19.4 million cases to 22.3 million cases in the quarter. Average net sales price per case increased 11.3% from 8.55 per case to 9.53. The increase in average net sales price per case is attributable to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from higher priced Monster Energy and Java Monster products, as well as the price increases mentioned previously, which were effective January 1. Over the quarter the entire US ready-to-drink beverage business has seen weakness across all categories. This weakness was most pronounced in c-store cold drink channels where the vast majority of energy drinks are sold. Consequently the moderating growth we have seen in energy drinks appears in part due to the challenging macro economic environment, and the resulting declines in store traffic primarily in the C&G sector and especially in Southern California. During April, Coke reported that their North American beverage volumes for the quarter were flat and would have been down without acquisitions, namely Glaceau. PepsiCo reported that their North American beverage business had declined almost two points in major channels versus earlier expectations of modest growth. CCE notes of their total non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages in Nielsen measured channels, all channels combined actually had declining cases during the quarter, and PPG also reported that the liquid refreshment beverage category was down in measured channels in the quarter. Other beverage categories, which have historically shown growth, have also slowed considerably. For example, the sports drink category was only up 1% in the quarter. Against this general slow down, the Energy drink category still managed to achieve good growth. In the C&G channel, the Energy drink category grew 18%, while in the grocery channel, the category grew 13%. Consequently, the Energy drink category’s continued gain in both dollars and volume despite the macro economic environment demonstrates the strength and continued growth of the Energy drink category. Consequently the growth of our Monster Energy brand outstripped continued positive category growth. The Monster brand grew 51% in the C&G channel and 42% in grocery. According to Nielsen all outlets combined for the 13 weeks ended March 29, 2008, the Monster brand grew nearly 50% and increased its market share by nearly six points to 27% market share compared to Red Bull, which grew 17% but had no gain in market share, which was flat at 37%. Rockstar grew 5.1% but lost 1.3 points and now have a... at the end they are having 11% market share. Full Throttle was down 3.5% in sales and lost 1.2 points to a 5.6% market share, while Amp grew 22% with a 0.2point gain to a 5.5% market share. Java Monster performed particularly well and in dollars, sales of Java Monster in the convenience channel had reached about half of the Starbucks Frappuccino line. We think that this is a remarkable achievement bearing in mind that Java Monster was just launched a year ago and throughout the year was continuing to gain distribution and is still below… distribution figures are still not up to the levels of Starbucks Frappuccino. Energy drink sales in certain non-measured channels such as club stores have experienced some softness in the quarter. The Energy drink category has overtaken and is now larger than both the Sports drink category, like Gatorade, Powerade etcetera and the ready-to-drink category AriZona, Lipton, and Nestea by a substantial margin. The growth of the Energy drink category continues to outpace the growth of both the sports drink and ready-to-drink tea categories. This clearly supports our view that the Energy category is not a fad and its continued growth is further evidence that Energy drinks are becoming an integral part of everyday life. In fact, Energy drinks are now the second biggest category in c-stores by dollars of the CSDs and continue to take shelf space and market share primarily from CSDs. In dollars, in c-stores, this premium priced category is even bigger than bottled water, sports drink, and ready-to-drink teas. The latest Nielsen figures for the 13 weeks ended 4/26/08 were received by us yesterday and reflected increase in sales for Energy drinks in the convenience category of 16.5%, 12.5% in grocery, and 27.7% in drug. According to Nielsen all outlets combined, the Energy category grew 15.9% during the period. Monster grew 47.5% has picked up 5.9 points of market share to 27.5% while Red Bull grew 14.2% and lost point six of a point of market share. Rockstar grew 4.6 and lost 1.2 points of market share to 11% while Full Throttle lost 6% and 1.2 points of market share down to 5.3 in total. Amp decreased sales 29.3% and gained 0.6 points of a point to a 6.2% market share, but at the expense of Pepsi’s other Energy drinks No Fear, Adrenaline Rush, and Sobe, which lost in excess of 3 points in aggregate. The NOS brand which was acquired by Coke as part of the FUZE transaction benefited from a substantial increase in distribution levels as a result of that brand being taken through the CCE system. In the latest four-week period, in the convenience category, Monster share increased to 29.1% while Red Bull share declined to 35.1% and so we all continuing to close the gap on Red Bull. Gross margin for the quarter decreased 2% to 49.4% from 51.6% for the comparable quarter in 2007. Factors, which positively affected the gross margin was the increasing product mix to DST products from 84% to 88% for the quarter as well as increases in the past of certain of the Monster and Java Monster products. Gross margin was negatively affected by the change in sales mix primarily the increasing sales of lower margin Java Monster products. Sales of Java Monster increased to just over 14% of our gross sales for the quarter. Additionally, we experienced an increase in certain raw material costs principally the process apple juice concentrate, which had a greater effect on the Warehouse division. We believe that the price increases for Monster and Monster Java absorbed the increases in the cost of goods for those products. However the Warehouse division incurred substantial increases in cost of goods for its juice and soda products. This increase had a material impact on the gross margins for the Warehouse division and resulted in a negative contribution margin for that division for the quarter. We have a process of increasing prices of selected products in that division to offset such price increases and we are able to negotiate an early termination of the WIC contract, which going forward will be on a non-exclusive basis and this will address the losses that were incurred in the quarter with our apple juice and juice blend products. For example market prices for apple juice concentrates have almost doubled over the last year. Sales mix and additional cost contributed about 1.7% of the decreasing gross margin. The balance was attributable to the increasing promotional allowances principally an increasing chain marketing allowances and programs to increases shelf space. Although the cost of the programs is equally amortized over the calendar year, the bulk of shelf resets did not take place until the second quarter. In fact in certain chains shelf resets are full at this time in the process of being implemented. The cost of the company for shelf space on a per shelf basis in 2008 is comparable with the cost that was incurred by us last year for similar programs. The amount of additional shelf space that we were able to secure varies greatly from chain to chain but on average has come down to between 30% and 60% of incremental space. We caution that we do not believe that there is a direct correlation between the amount of addition shelf space and sales. However we do believe that the increased shelf space will provide additionally visibility for our product and will result in increase sales. Additionally, as we have been able to secure shelf space for Java Monster in the coffee door we believe that this will reduce the cannibalization that we believe occurred in the past due to Java Monster having been placed directly into Monster's existing space in the energy door. We are hopeful that going forward the cost of promotional allowances particularly chain CMAs and MDF will be lower as percentage of net sales as our sales increase over the remainder of the year. Operating income for the three-months increased 34% to $42.8 million from $31.9 million a year ago. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to 20.2% for the three-months ended March 31, 2008 from 19.2% for the same quarter last year. Net income for the three-months increased 43% to $28.8 million or $0.29 per diluted share from $20.2 million or $0.21 per diluted share last year. Interest income was $3.6 million compared to $1.5 million a year ago and our effective tax rate for the three-months was approximately 38%. The change in the tax rate is attributable to the domestic deduction previously described. We expect our tax rate to be in the 38% range going forward. Distribution cost was slightly lower at 5.7% compared to 6% in the same period last year. Increased cost of warehousing was offset by freight savings primarily due to the addition ... of additional co-packers around the US. Selling expenses for the quarter were 14.9% versus 10.1% a year ago. The increase in selling expenses was largely attributable to increased commissions and royalties which increased to 1.7% from 1.2% in the 2007 quarter largely due to commissions payable to Anheuser-Bush under the AB Coordination Agreement as a greater proportion of our sales are now being affected though the AB wholesalers. Sponsorships were 4.8%, up from 2.7% a year earlier. A large component of sponsorship cost during the quarter relates to our sponsorship of the Supercross Series, which is now called the Monster Energy Supercross series, which we believe is a very important property for us and for the brand and helps expose our brand not only in the US but internationally where the series is shown on television and throughout Europe. The Supercross season takes place between January and May. As this is the sponsorship of an event as opposed to an annual sponsorship of athletics where we traditionally have focused and which are usually amortized over the full year, the cost of this sponsorship has been fully amortized over the season, which resulted in about two-thirds of the sponsorship cost for the event being expensed in the first quarter. The cost of sponsorships also increased due to the sponsorship cost incurred by us to launch… support the launch of Monster in the United Kingdom. Cost incurred by us in connection with the launch in United Kingdom were both sponsorships as well as G&A amounted to some $2 million in the quarter, but we obviously didn't have the benefit of sales, there were very nominal sales that took place and we are now starting to get listings and starting to sell going into the second quarter. Additionally merchandise displays increased from 1.1% to 2.2%, [inaudible] was up from 0.9% to 1.5% and in-store demos primarily in connection with the launch of Java Monster in some club stores was up from 0.4% to 0.9%. We believe that the selling expenses as a percentage of sales will be lower going forward as sales that occurred at the end of last year in anticipation of the price increases impacted sales in the quarter, timing issues occurred with respect to both Supercross sponsorship and the launch cost of Monster in the United Kingdom will not reoccur. Payroll and G&A costs excluding legal fees associated with the stock option investigation and distributor terminations were approximately the same in both periods. With regard to customer mix in the quarter, retail groceries sales decreased from 10% to 9%, sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers decreased from 16% to 14%, while sales to full service distributors increased from 69% to 73%. Sales to health food distributors remained flat at 2% and generally other sales reduced were from 3% to 2%. With regard to sales by market area, gross sales outside of California increased from 68.9% to 76.4% this quarter. Sales in California now represent less than 25% of the overall gross sales of the company. In fact, in the DST division, sales outside of California now represent 82.7% of that division sales, up from 75% last year. Gross sales to customers outside of the United States increased from $5.6 million to $17 million and as a percentage such sales increased from 2.9% of gross sales to 7%. I think that it is pertinent to point out that if one were to basically take into account the estimated buy-in at the end of the fourth quarter and add those sales and the effect that they would have had on this quarter had they fallen in the quarter, and excluding the extraordinary one-off cost with Monster UK, which really didn't have any corresponding income, the result would be a pro forma earnings diluted EPS of about $0.36 as opposed to the reported EPS. I think that just… we believe just shows a more normalized trading position. Moving to the... moving to the balance sheet, working capital increased from $187.3 million to $276.3 million. Accounts receivable were $81.8 million at March 31, slightly up from the $81.5 million at December and up from $68.8 million at end of March last year. Days outstanding was 32.7 for receivables at March 31, up from 28.7 in December, but down from 35.4 the year before. Our inventory balances were $109.8 million as of March, up from $98.1 million at December 31, and up from $61.6 million the year before. The increase in inventories over the prior year was primarily attributable to increased raw materials and finished goods related to Java Monster. Average days of inventory was 92 days at March 31, which is about the 73 days of inventory as of the end of December, and 69 days the year before. Accounts payable balances was $60.7 million at March 31, up from $56.8 million at the end of December. Cash and cash equivalents were $51.2 million from $12.4 million at the end of December and short-term investments increased to a $107.9 million from $63 million at the end of December. Long-term investments reduced from $227 million at the end of December to $164.4 million. Long-term investments are comprised of municipal or educational other public body related notes with an auction reset feature. With the liquidity issues experienced in the global credit markets certain of our holding in our... of our auction rate securities having a face value of $207 million as of March 31, experienced failed auctions. The face value of such securities have since been reduced to $169.8 million as of the end of April after redemptions during the month. This bought the strong credit ratings attributable to these notes for liquidity reasons we determine that a temporary impairment of $5.4 million had occurred as of March. And therefore recorded a charge of $3.2 million net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. These securities continue to accrue interest at their contractual rates, until their respective options succeed or they are redeemed. Based on our cash and other short-term investments and expected operating cash flows and other sources of cash, we do not anticipate that the current lack of liquidity of these investments will have a material effect on our liquidity or our working capital. To give you a trading update, gross sales for April were approximately $103.6 million, 29%-odd up on April last year. Sales of Monster and Java Monster brands in the month are up approximately 35.4% over last year. We have continued to make progress with our international growth plans in the United Kingdom. As I indicated earlier we incurred approximately $2 million in cost relating to the United Kingdom operations, but do not have a benefit of sales. Sales have commenced and we believe will gain traction going into the third quarter of this year. We were also revaluating the potential launch of Monster in certain additional countries, in Europe later in the year, but have not finalized arrangements in that regard at this time. Sales in both Canada and Mexico continue to improve and we are continuing to gain market share in both those countries. Additionally, distribution of sales are also continuing to improve in South Africa, which is another overseas market, which commenced sales recently. On the Hansen Natural side, we are continuing with the roll out of our new sports beverages in 10.5-ounce sleek cans. In conclusion I would like to reiterate that the additional sales of approximately $21.5 million that occurred in December and would otherwise have occurred during the first quarter had a materially effect on our results for the first quarter and the impact there are ought to be taken into account in evaluating the level of expenses that are likely to be incurred by the company for the reminder of the year. Our ability to increase our operating income in the phase of increased operating expenses as compared to the decrease in operating income suffered by all of our major competitors in their respective North American beverage businesses in the quarter underscores in our view the long-term sustainability both in sales and profitability of the Energy drink category. One of the other housekeeping items I would like to address, we have experienced an unbelievably large number of requests for telephone discussions, consultations, in person interviews, making it literally almost impossible for us, particularly myself, to spend the time and attention to vote to the growth of the business and the expansion of the business. As a policy in future, we are going to limit the amount of discussions and meetings that we hold with investors... potential investors and what we are proposing to do is there will be an annual meeting later during the course of this... next... current quarter where we will be available to answer questions and also what we are proposing to do is to set up a procedure in the future where we will we have a... we call it a mid-period or mid-quarterly discussion with investors through a conference call where we will be available to give a trading update and to answer specific questions and investors will be invited to attend that call and to ask questions. And in that way, we will try and limit the time taken by management to deal with these requests. We don't object to dealing with the requests, its just some people come very, very burdens and not enough time to actually deal with the large number of requests that we have been experiencing. I would like to open the floor to your questions at this time. Question and Answer
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator instructions] We will start with Judy Hong at Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Hey Rodney, how are you?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Fine. Hi, Judy, thank you, good in you.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: I just wanted to understand just the sales number in the first quarter, you talked about the inventory destocking affecting the first quarter by 8 or 9 points and then you had some of the non-Monster brand showing some decline, so if I understand you correctly, is that Monster... on an underlying basis was up... just for 7or 8 points of inventory destocking, what do you think the underlying number was for Monster in the first quarter?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: So Judy, I am just not completely sure, I think I gave the number for Monster itself was up in the quarter was up 36%.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: It's up 36%, right. But that was also depressed by the inventory destocking that happened in the first quarter?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Right, right.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: So on an underlying basis, if we add 8 or 9 points that you said impacted the first quarter number?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Right.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: The underlying number would have been closer to 44%, 45%?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Now, where does the inventory level stand at the end of the first quarter at the wholesale level, has that now come to normalized rate?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: We think it has, but again it's something we've... I don't have precise numbers on.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Then you also said in four weeks ending April 26 in the c-store data, Monster was up 48% to 47.5%?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Right.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Why is there such a disconnect then between that number and your gross sales number quarter-to-date, because you said quarter-to-date your gross sales are up 29%?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: 29% for the company.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: And I gave you the breakup. So, just on other question, we said about 44% is probably a little bit higher than that 45% if you take the effect of the buy-ins into accounts, probably slightly higher.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: The number is about 36%. 36% is the actual and... what we're saying is that, if you take that $21 million, yes, we would be closer to 50% increase in the quarter for Monster.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Right.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Now in the month of April, there what we've said is that the month of April is up 29% but the number for Monster and Java Monster is closer to 36%.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: 36%?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And so if I... but then you also said that in the c-stores those brands are running up 47% or so?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Right.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: So I'm just trying to understand why there is the disconnect between the 47% versus the 36% gross sales number, I think you've reported?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: There is timing, there maybe a little weakness in some of the other channels, there is unmeasured channels, I can't tell that exactly, but it's a timing issue with the purchases from distributors and their stocking. I just don't have a handle on that. I can only tell you what our numbers are and what the sell-through is.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And can you just give us a little bit more perspective on what's going on with these other brands, the LE brands that are showing more of a decline?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. They just have shown a decline, we've repositioned the Lost Energy brand, we've got new packaging, we've actually gone out and done a test market in Florida with that and we're busy with that now, resetting shelves that we have a better line up, full line of on that and we're seeing the results and then we are going to implement that to enroll and new packaging and the extra... the product out across through the U.S. We believe that is still a viable brand and we think that that's got legs. The case of Unbound... that's something that we are seeing a sort of falling off and we're not looking to promote that going forward and the same thing would jog up. In the case of Energy juice, what has happened there we believe in the brand, we are currently repositioning that brand, it was one SKU, it was just lost on that juice shelf. We are now going to... we are in the process of launching three SKUs for that brand and will be... that will be going out within the next couple of months. Once you do that, we all going to have a fully-fledged launch of the three juice items, which are all 100% juice and are non-carbonated. So, that we think that, I have a point of difference, we think that there is a niche for those products, and we believe by having the three products, we will be able to gain visibility on the shelf and really be able to make something of them. So, that is where we are, but in the, while we've been repositioning that brand, we haven't put Monster behind it, because of the repositioning and the re-doing of the packaging and that brand has certainly fallen off in sales as compared to last year there were some pipeline in the brand last year with the AB distributors, but we believe that, that will pick up as we launch going into the end of this quarter, or the beginning of the third quarter.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then, on your gross margin line what is your expectation in terms of how that number could behave for the rest of the year. I mean clearly you are taking more price increases in some of the other brands but you've got the average impact of the Java mix, are we looking at the first quarter as sort of the trend line going forward or how do you think that that margin will behave.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Well, one of the biggest factors on that margin, there are two areas, one is the mix of product, as I indicated Java Monster is now about 14%… it’s over 14.5% of our gross sales. We think that's not going to have a much larger percentage increase from where it is now, it will creep up probably a little bit still but not by much. What we do, what we have managed to contain is the pretty much the cost of Monster products within the cost increase on the Monster side, what we will find is some relief, we believe some relief in our gross margin by reducing our promotional allowances as we go forward. The promotional allowances are a big factor in between the gross and net amounts and then obviously on the margins. As I indicated, we've sort paid for a lot of the shelf programs, they've been amortized over the year, and we haven't really got the benefit of those programs going forward. We think that, by getting the benefit of those programs in additional shelf space, we will have increased sales, and what's going to happen is you're going to not have a commensurate increase in the price obviously of those allowances. They're going to basically continue at the level that we've expensed them at. So as a percentage they are going to go down and that will have a positive effect with think on the margins. In the Warehouse division, the WIC contract is also stimulated in April, and the results of that, quite a large portion of the allowances between gross and net in the warehouse division, but on the blended right was attributable to the rebates payables to the state under the WIC program, those will also no longer apply which will effect that. So, we do think that going forward, once we start looking at those costs a percentage of sales they will reduce and there will be a commensurate increase in gross margins. I can't tell were they will go to. But, we do believe that they will be an increase in our gross margins going forward.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay, then just my final question, you said that you are starting to get some listing in the UK market. Can you just give us some perspective and how optimistic you are about that opportunity and how quickly we would see some contribution from your sales and profit perspective?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: We are very optimistic about the market, it's a large market, it's a big market for energy drinks, we estimate that market to be probably about $800 million to $900 million probably even close to $1 billion. We think that we can make an impact in that market. It is going to take time. They have pretty strict rates reviewed dates. And so we've got fit into and make the difference schedules of the different channels. That's taking time, but it is not as though we can press a button and put it into existing space. We don't have existing space. And so for us to roll out our brand versus a Coke or a Pepsi is a very different scenario. So, we've gone into two of the big wholesalers there. We all start... starting to take steps to get into the, what they call garage four course the gas stations. We are all looking at a number of other avenues and it is going. So whilst we are very hopeful it is going to take time and I'm can't put a time on it, but I'm hopeful that by the time we get to the third quarter, we will be starting to achieve some decent distribution levels and start to see some sales. But again, as we go forward into the year I don't expect there to be a contribution from the UK for a little while. I do obviously anticipate that we will not have this sort of negative cost that we had in the first quarter where we didn't have any sales to offset it. But hopefully we believe that we are hoping to get to a sort of breakeven by the year-end. But that will depend on how quickly we were able to ramp up sales in the UK. But long-term or the medium-term, we really think that's an exciting market, it will give us a good base, and that's really helping us get to understand the European markets and how to launch in Europe, and we all started to obviously as I indicated making enquiries about appointing distributors in other countries and setting up an infrastructure in other countries to start launching the products there. We're in the middle of that now and hopefully that we will be able to actually go into some additional countries before the end of this year.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next we will move to Scott Van Winkle with Canaccord Adams.
Scott Van Winkle - Canaccord Adams: Hi Rodney, how are you doing?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Scott. Fine, thank you. And you?
Scott Van Winkle - Canaccord Adams: I'm good. The first question you mentioned in the mid-quarter update, which I like the idea. Have you ever thought about hiring an IR person to help you out with all these questions?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: We could hire an IR person, but I... the business is very, as you know, it's very personal, it's very, we are very much on of top of it. It's... I don’t think anybody from the other side would be very impressed when they get a formal presentation from somebody who really doesn't have a real handle on the business or the... some of the issues and the intricacies. And we just believe we are better served where we are being involved and remain involved in dealing with investors, but at the same time it is a pretty big drain on our time.
Scott Van Winkle - Canaccord Adams: So, Rodney, two questions that I have really revolve around I think most have asked this question. And that is the category deceleration and second is gross margins. So first on the category, your business in general starts accelerating year-over-year growth rate. You mentioned the strong Neilson growth rate in the 13 weeks ending April, but can we look at the March quarter may be the Neilson data relative to December quarter. Obviously it was up year-over-year at a good pace. But did we see the dollars up on a sequential basis from the December quarter into the March quarter?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: I can… we think they are about... I'll give you the number here, if you could calculate…about 150 or just deduct it from that. The actual number on the measured channels was about 150 and then in December, the difference was the increase in actual dollars was 220.
Scott Van Winkle - Canaccord Adams: I was thinking more of not the increase, I assume what you are giving me is the increase year-over-year, but that is actual dollar sales according to Neilson in December were 220 and then what was the number in the March period?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Okay. If you look at the actual dollars in the... I can give you that figure, the actual dollars in December for the category was $1.06 billion and the actual dollars in the first quarter was $1.24 billion.
Scott Van Winkle - Canaccord Adams: And I assume that the monster brands were up as well on a sequential basis. They would certainly be. So my conclusion is that you were seeing year-over-year growth but we are also seeing sequential growth in two periods that should be relatively similar. Obviously, there’s going to be some seasonality business, but I assume December and March are about the same considering weather and what people drink you know.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. In fact, Monster numbers are pretty much the same in those two periods in this all outlets combined. The first period is usually a weaker period than the fourth period... fourth quarter.
Scott Van Winkle - Canaccord Adams: Okay. So there is normally a sequential decline that you are seeing growth on a sequential basis?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Well, it's flat.
Scott Van Winkle - Canaccord Adams: That’s it.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: It's flat, but we believe that is positive because the first quarter traditionally is weaker than the fourth quarter.
Scott Van Winkle - Canaccord Adams: Okay. Excuse me, and then moving on to margins...
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Sorry. Scott.
Scott Van Winkle - Canaccord Adams: We all understand that Java Monster lower margin business, can you remind us what the delta is between the margin on your traditional monster brands and the Java at lease in round terms?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: All right. Just before I got into margins, what I want also say to you in those numbers again you have that volume issue on these two periods you are comparing. So if you took $21 million, which is at higher level and this at retail so it’s probably closer $30 million, $40 million, mid 30's out of the December numbers and added them into the Monster numbers for the first quarter. You would then... we would get a sequential we would have sequential growth.
Scott Van Winkle - Canaccord Adams: Right. That's why I was focusing on the Neilson numbers rather than your shipments. I would assume the consumers didn't give a lot of volume but your retailers.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Yes. No, that is correct, I will take your point, sorry.
Scott Van Winkle - Canaccord Adams: Okay. And on the margins, can you give us a delta between Java obviously rose from what was it, 8% of your shipments in the December quarter to 14% in the March quarter? Can you give us the delta on the margin there?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Margins are roughly about 58 and 37, 38 the differences.
Scott Van Winkle - Canaccord Adams: Okay. That was more than I thought. And you mentioned lower margins in the wholesale business because of higher input cost, can you give us a decline on a year-over-year basis on what the wholesale gross margins were versus obviously focusing on the soda and juice side?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: And just...
Scott Van Winkle - Canaccord Adams: I am sorry, warehouse not wholesale, pardon me.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Let me see if I can find that for you. Sorry, I’ve got warehouse financial… margins in the Warehouse division went down from 19% to 9%.
Scott Van Winkle - Canaccord Adams: Okay. So that's a fairly significant number?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, yeah. That's pretty much cost of goods were up particularly apple juice and things of that nature. Sugar was up during the year, year-on-year... cost of fructose and sucrose and cans and we were locked into the week program that caused us to have to go and buy in the open market, because we had a... obviously we had increase in Monster and apple juice both.
Scott Van Winkle - Canaccord Adams: And what was the specific date of ending the WIC contract and what percentage of the warehouse sales was the WIC contract?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: The WIC contract terminated in April, so there will be a little bit of a tail coming through probably in May stocks of rebates but of the May to June, but of the... it's $22 million, gross, you take the $30 million, it’s about a third of that division... just over a third of that division.
Scott Van Winkle - Canaccord Adams: Okay. And last question is... well, its kind of two pieces. First, I believe if I have heard it correctly, when you reported the December quarter you talked about it was a 31% or 33% growth for the January/February period, and obviously you were posting lower growth for the full March quarter. So there was a fairly significant deceleration in March quarter sales and I assume that correlates with the inventory being much higher on a sequential basis, what was the primary reason for that deceleration from the Jan/Feb period into the March? And then second, well, I asked the question about dollar sales from Nielsen between December and March, can you look at April Nielsen data versus the March data and sales were up sequentially there? Sorry, that was a lot in one question.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, okay. In March, it was [inaudible] a couple of points, but we had a strong March last year and that's all I can suggest on that number. The number... I'm just going to get the number... April versus March.
Scott Van Winkle - Canaccord Adams: And while you are looking at that, Rodney, you are talking about that March versus Jan/Feb, with the category slowing, was there any change in your customers algorithms for how much inventory did they destock inventory in that March period?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: I don't have… have no knowledge about that.
Scott Van Winkle - Canaccord Adams: Okay.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: I don't have a sales on Nielsen for the four weeks, all I, on a four-week basis, I am just working in the convenience category, there we've continued to increase our share, our share in convenience has gone up from sequentially from 27.2% at the end of December to 29.1% at the end of April as the share of the category, but I just don't have actual hard dollars on a Nielsen basis on month-by-month.
Scott Van Winkle - Canaccord Adams: With the shipment dollars up from March to April?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Our shipment dollars... I can get that information for you.
Scott Van Winkle - Canaccord Adams: The question is about, obviously the category growth rate is the biggest question, here.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: It's substantially up.
Scott Van Winkle - Canaccord Adams: It's substantially up.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: January versus March, yes.
Scott Van Winkle - Canaccord Adams: Great thank you very much.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Pleasure.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll next go to [inaudible] with Citi.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks. I just wanted to see, are you still seeing shortage issues on the Java product?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: No.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, and as there’s still some cannibalization going on with the Green Monster?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: We think there is because most of the Java Monster products have basically found they are well into the shop in the middle of the Monster Chow. With these store resets at all taking place now have been for some weeks and we’ll continue for the next reason till we’ll set. I told that happens, you’re all going to have the cannibalization. We believe that once they go across and find their own home into the coffee door, that cannibalization will at least be reduced if, it might not be eliminated completely but it will be reduced.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, and then just wondering if you could give us sense for our promotional the Energy drink market is versus last year, versus last quarter?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: We think it's very comparable, we have been looking at processing [ph]. Processing has been reasonably be steady, there hasn’t been major processing fish-ups, but there is aggressive promotions out there. I mean that, it hasn't been, even I say, it's perhaps distinguished between cross promotion and promotion. It’s been aggressive promotion, there hasn't been aggressive cross promotion since they are all cross promotion is going on obviously, but it hasn't affected the actual every chilling process of our products in the trade.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay and then just wanted to see if you can update on the on-premise initiative and sort of what we think the potential is there?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: The potential is still very strong and it's quite large, but it is taking time to work away through it, just taking... it just takes time and we are all seeing results, we have seen substantial numbers of additional accounts being opened, but we are... but it is taking time. We are starting to put a new system in place, whereby we are getting specialist managers in store at the distributor level. At distributors, we have a focus on on-premise and not just general market and we’re seeing... starting to see some successes when there is that focus now, we are all starting to see successes, we are all seeing successes in various areas, for example, we have recently secured a contract with Southwest Airlines, whereby we’ve… Monster, the 8.3-ounce size is being, it will be sold as from pretty much in the last few days now on all Southwest Airlines Flights throughout the U.S. That’s… it's a very big carrier, it carries a lot of people, has thousands of flights a day. And so we believe that will give us good exposure we’ll help... be good business for us and also give us good sampling and exposure. So, it is happening, but it is happening, it's taking time.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Then, my last question has to do with your views on Red Bull 16.9 ounce can. What are you seeing there? Are they pretty much cannibalizing their 8-ounce or--?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: We believe they are cannibalizing their 8-ounce and the 12-ounce. What happened was they got an initial lift when they launched 12-ounce and then it sort of fell... they fell back a bit and then they launched the 16, they got another initial lift and then it fell back. If you look at the... if we look at the graph for Red Bull, we see those two sort of bumps, but they basically backed on. If we look at the last four weeks inconvenience for example, let me give you some of the Red Bull numbers, which I think are quite interesting. The Red Bull's numbers... they introduced... here Red Bull share, Red Bull share went up to 35%, 36.8% in January and that is sort of about, just after that really started to launch the 16-ounce. They did I think November, December time period. So, they went up from 35.1% to 36.1% to 36.8% by the end of January and then they dropped to 36.2%, they dropped to 35.7% and now they have dropped to 35.1%. And over that same time period, Rockstar was completely flat and we basically went up from 27.2% to 27.2%, 27.9%, 28.8% and 29.1%. So, that's really what's been happening in the last four or five months. We have actually increased share and are closing the gap between Red Bull and us and increasing the gap between the other competing brands below us, which... there's quite a big gap below where we are.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Thanks. So, just one point to add, I gave you the number earlier. In the last 13-week period, Red Bull's sales were up 14.2% against a category increase of 15.9%. So even with the 16-ounce, they've really just barely kept pace with the category effect that slipped marginally, but against the category and that’s in dollar terms. They clearly have lost substantially more in units. In volume, Monster has... sometime ago really surpassed Red Bull on a volume basis. There are some people who look at volume as to looking at a brand of strength and share of stomach. On a volume basis, we do so more than Red Bull.
Operator: Thank you, sir. We will go next to Alton Stump with Longbow Research.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Thank you. Good afternoon. I just had two... I hope should be pretty quick questions. First off, just to clarify on the disconnect for the March growth, on the last conference call, I think you noted, Rodney that overall sales were up 33%, but if you took out buy ahead impact, we've been up something in the low 50s and it looks March was up something like 20%. Was the buy ahead still impacting results even in the month of March? Is that what's going on or is there something else that I missed?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: We are not sure. Just I don't have an accurate enough answer to give you a positive answer on that. We think there may have been some ... there were some distributors who bought very heavy and we didn't see high levels of purchase from some of those distributors. There were quite large distributors right until late in March or early April. There was one market that was somehow explicably weak for us which was a big market, which was Los Angeles and we looked at the market and whatever reason the whole market was down, you may recall in January, February, March time period, it dropped quite substantially in January. The growth in ... for the market in Los Angeles and then it dropped off in March and again in April and we looked at that, because we were just out of line with the rest of the markets in the US. So, it was the only market that was down. What has happened in Los Angeles is that the market had the effect... it's a little up and sorry, it’s not up, the percentage down has reduced, but we've been able to turn the brand around there and we've grown our market share in Los Angeles and we are now up in Los Angeles. So from having... we were in line with the market because by large measure we... between Red Bull and us pretty much constitute or represent the bulk of the market. But we were able to turn that around, we were up in that market, which should be positive for us. But that may have also impacted that just that period of time as to why we didn't get buy-in on sales in a big market like Los Angeles for us where we were slightly down and that has turned around and moved back up now.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: All right. And then just a quick follow-up. I guess what's confusing is looking at Hansen Nielsen c-store data even with the weakness in the LA market, it looks like Monster was up, I think it was 49% year-over-year rolling down starting from February, that's where I am just trying to figure out, was there a disconnect versus what you reported on the last call, but it looks like they are not, is that for sure?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: No, we are not sure why... the timing issues, there is inventory issues, there is a difference between the two. They should technically match up pretty closely, but there has been this difference, and that's... it's still is there, but I think what's important is that the sell through right at retail is really, really, that's where the amount comes from. And that is still stronger, that is in the high 40s. So we believe that we will start... we will get a catch-up on our sales to the trade.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Okay. And then just one other question on the gross margin, it sounds like an awful lot of the year-over-year decline was due to weakness outside of the energy drink business for you. Just looking at the price per case, I guess it was $9.53, it looks like it’s fairly in line, may be up a little bit, but not much from the back half of last year, just trying to get an idea where the price increase came in, was it still late in the quarter, because of the buy ahead that didn't really hit the bottom line as much as you would have thought, or is there something else going on there?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I don't know, I mean it did... it was implemented, but it was implemented for the 16-ounce package, it’s not all packages and it was implemented for Java. So it didn't... it wasn't across every package, it didn't affect our 24-ounce... we'd increased price on that in about July, and it doesn't need to affect the 8-ounce.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Okay. Well, was there an decrease in price rebates that you are offering either for the energy drink lines or elsewhere during the quarter that maybe you might cause that?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: No, no, no. As I said, our CMAs and things are pretty much the cost of the programs on a per shelf basis, because obviously we have more shelves and the cost is going to increase because of the programs per store. But on a per shelf basis we pretty much have the same cost and we're trying... the way we're trying with kind of obviously is to equate it back to a per case cost. And a lot of it will depend on what sales that we get and what the sales are for the rest of the year. But the… our branding is based on a similar sales... very similar sales per case cost as we had in the previous year.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Okay. That's all I have. Thank you.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Thanks.
Operator: And we will take our final question from Mark Astrachan at Stifel Nicolaus.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Good afternoon, guys.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Mark.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: I guess, just a couple of questions here. One, any idea about the amount of support that you put behind some of your secondary brands, you talked about cutting some of the support out for Joker and for Unbound, but obviously some of the other brands have been weak as well? I'm just trying to figure out how much money you are throwing behind those brands versus how much you are throwing behind your Monster, your core business including Java?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: We really stopped putting money behind Unbound and Joker. Lost, we are still putting money behind because we still believe it is a viable and it's still a solid brand. But, some of the things that you have in place... just take some time to run down, if you have annual agreements or annual sponsorship agreements. And as those are running down, you're not going to renew them. We haven't spent very much behind Rumba, but obviously once we reposition it, we will spend something behind it and we obviously need to give it the support it will need in order to enable it to succeed. I'm not able to answer the questions any more, because they are not... they are not the big number, the majority of our marketing is put behind, efforts behind, obviously behind Monster.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: All right, okay. And shifting to the distribution opportunities, we've been finding that where you’re in the AB system, you continue to outperform in a lot of the markets where you’re not in the AB system, have you given any more thought in terms of wanting to switch incremental volume through that system. And in particular, would you consider something like that in a market like LA where you have been weak?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: We... you say we're weak, but we have a 40% share in LA. So there is not much high you could go, but we are reevaluating the possible transition of additional territories to AB, that is under discussion at the moment and we are looking at it.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. And along the same lines, when you think about the opportunity for incremental distribution point, what do you see there and what I mean is, from a penetration standpoint, if you look at the standard data obviously just having one facing in a store will give you that amount of penetration. But as I figure it, you have a lot of opportunity to increase the amount of incremental distribution, so convenience store, supermarkets and general, I mean what do you think of that opportunity?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: We think that we do have that opportunity, and we believe that the programs we are putting in place now will enable us to get the additional distribution for the ancillary brands or the ancillary brand extensions within the Monster line. And we'll enable that quality and depth of that distribution to be improved, particularly having working through a good distribution system and so, we are, we do believe there is opportunity and that is why we are also looking at that possibility of looking at additional… few things switched to the AB system. It is not with, it’s own issues as well. There are some territories where you have channels that don't line up or dry areas and that system may not actually give you a lift. When you... there is a trade-off and there are some distributors who just spot the fact that they’re in the AB system, don't devote the time and attention. There is a way of we believe working within that system that does show the results. We know that we have a method of doing it and we think it works. It doesn't sometimes, however, help because you can't persuade an individual owner to adopt that system. We continue to try and do so and we show them the results of some of their compatriots and those and the success that they had and that has improved and we will continue to do so. But, there are those opportunities but it's just really a distribution game and it's a question of being able to persuade them to give more focus to the brand and how to do it within their own companies, but that is something we are all working on and we are looking at additional alternatives at this point in time with the AB Group.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. Great. And then the final question just relates to the category generally and building on a previous question. I guess what I'm trying to figure out is what your thoughts are on the outlook for the Energy category in general and specifically we have seen new market entrants, including Starbucks, they recently announced they are coming in. Do you see these new products coming in as further validation of the categories?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Undoubtedly, we think that is validation. I mean what they are doing is they’re sitting there. But, there are the reasons, Starbucks is seeing a decline in their market share quite substantially since we've launched Java Monster. And so that's where you're looking at and saying what I’d do to increase my sales and all of the sudden just Johnny come lately but Java making energy drink, but I don't think Starbucks necessarily has got the credibility to make an energy drink. But, they will go out there, they will get distribution, they have strong distribution partner in Pepsi and they will get the shelf space. But it will be... there will be a free for all following us in the energy coffee category as there's already it was... the sheep follow whether it was Rockstar, then it's going to be [inaudible], it's now going to be Starbucks. You are going to have your real followers, just don’t think there’re points of difference and come in. I don't think they're on its own is that material to really validate the category. I think the category is a validated category, I mean the category is... this year will be probably... our estimates is it will be over $10 billion at retail. I mean that's a substantial category, it's been in the U.S. now for over 10, 12 years. It's been in the Europe for 16, 17 years. Europe is still seeing very healthy growth in the high single digits, low double digits in the teens and it varies. In the early 2000, the growth in Europe generally slowed to the very low single digits and then the category picked up again, and I think it's accelerating. I think by going into the European market with our brand and there're other competitors going into that market, it will effect expand the category and they’ll continue to grow. We think that this is a very viable category. It brings benefits to consumers that aren't delivered by other products. Other products are variations of refreshment, different forms of refreshment. We think this has a different function and has different purpose and therefore we do believe there is a place in the sun for this category and that's being shown by the resilience of the category, the resilience of pricing and literally the continued growth. I mean we are seeing categories like Gatorade and things that are literally flattered down for the first time in years and years. The category in this first quarter as I indicated earlier in my remarks, has really contracted quite a bit, when you look at that in the light of where energy drinks are, the energy drink growth... it has moderated but it’s still very healthy. And we believe it can continue to possibly increase as we go forward, but we are obviously trading with bigger numbers, but by any stretch of the imagination on any argument of $10 billion category is part of what's... if you have to stay.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Right. Okay, great. And then just one final question, it looks like you started some of the share repel in the quarter, I think your share count was a little lower?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: That is not correct.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: No, okay. So you haven't started it yet...
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: No, we obviously we thought, no.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. So when will you start it and what are your thoughts in terms of burning through that since... obviously $200 million given the amount of cash flow you drove off, isn't a huge amount, just generally what are your thoughts there?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: The lowest stock price has been... is quite a large factor in coming out with a lower diluted share count number. It's just a question of how you value the options and the dilution factors.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. So when do you plan then to start the share repel program?
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: We can't give you an [inaudible] to do so. When we are out of the quiet period, which is where we've all... once we've released our results, filed our 10-Q, we will then be in a position to deal with this and then we propose to... to deal with at that time we will talk to some personal advisors in the Board and we will make a decision on how to go forward. But obviously it's in our interest to do that sensibly and properly and then to... it's not something we are going to... we intend to just rush into overnight.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: We are committing the funds, we think that it is the right decision for the company and we are going to implement it at... over an appropriate period.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Great. Thank you.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn things over to you Mr. Sacks for any additional or closing remarks.
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: Thank you. I really don't have anything additional to add. I think that we have seen some challenging costs and spending in order to continue to support the brand and we are obviously... it's very important for us to make sure we invest sufficiently in the brand and in supporting the brand to make sure the brand stays strong, that is the prime asset that we have and... but we do believe that, as I did indicate earlier in the call that our spending will start immediate writing and we’ll be a bit lower as a percentage of ourselves as sales increased over the year. We've set programs in place, but we do anticipate increased sales going into [inaudible], which will have a benefit in that regard. We're still very excited about the energy category, it's continuing to grow, we are still excited about Java, we're getting great feedback from both buyers and consumers. If you look at the size of Java Monster, what it has been able to achieve in less than a year, it really has been quite remarkable and that prompted the responses we have got now that from Starbucks that they are introducing an energy drink, and as we said that all the other energy drinks have just followed us to try and introduce a coffee drink to try and grab some of the market. They obviously see the results. So we think that all goes well for us as a company, we do have plans to continue to be innovative and to innovate and increase, add new products as we go through the year and we are proposed to do so. So, thank you very much for your support and what we will do is we will obviously publish in order to... about the... what I'd call the mid-term conference call where we will give an update... trading update to investors in about six weeks time. Thank you very much.
Operator: And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating and have a nice day.

Executives: Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman, CEO
Analysts: Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus Dara Mohsenian - J.P. Morgan Jacqueline Rider - Lazard Capital Markets Andrew Sawyer - Goldman Sachs Alton Stump - Longbow Research
Operator: Good day everyone, thank you for joining today's Hansen Natural Corporation’s Fourth Quarter 2007 Financial Results conference call. Today's call is been recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call to the Chief Executive officer, Mr. Rodney Sacks. Please go ahead sir.
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. To start I'd just like to record, that certain statements made in this call, may constitute forward-looking statements, within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues and profitability. We caution these statements are qualified by their terms or important factors, many of which are outside of the control of the company, that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from the statements made herein. We also wish to record that we assure no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, thank you. As indicated in the announcement, the fourth quarter net sales was a record for us. Sales rose 63% to $247 million, and net income also jumped 103% to $45 million. I'll just go through the fourth quarter results. Net sales benefited from both strong growth in the category and continued market share gains by Monster. According to the Nielsen all outlets combined, the energy category grew some 27% in the 13 weeks end of December 29, 2007 versus year ago. And Monster continue to grow ahead of the category with sales increasing approximately 54% in the same period and picking up over 4.5 percentage share points. In the... all outlets combine to the end of January, Monster was ahead. The category... the all outlet combined category is up about 23.7%, Monster is up 52.3% with a 26% share, which is 4.9 points over the prior period. The strong performance of Java Monster in the conveyance channel has also contributed to Q4 sales growth. Within the quarter, approximately 7% to 8% of the quarterly sales were attributable to pre-buying in advance of price increases, that took effect on January 1, that is our sort of best estimates and I will go into that little more when we deal with the quarter and the first... the results for the first two months of this year. Gross margin in the three months decrease 2% from… to 51% from 53% for the comparable 2006 quarter, if you will recall the comparable 2006 quarter was unusually high, our average historically has been in that 52% range, and sometimes dropping into the 51%, we had a very high quarter in last year, and if you look at the year, the numbers are little bit more different... little bit more... we feel more normalized margins for the year we effectively 51.7% from the comparable margin of 52.3% the year before. The factors effecting gross profit margin include, the increased change of product mix, the increased change of DSD products from 84% to 89% for the quarter, versus the prior year, on a positive side. On the negative side, we had increased sales mix of Java Monster, Java Monster was approximately 13% of gross sales for the quarter, and we incurred increased costs of dairy ingredients during the year that we adopt and they started to come off in December/January will, I will refer to that also, bit late of the day, did affect our margins, and also, a slight change in the mix within Monster itself where we had a little more of the 24-ounce products and juice products which also have slightly lower margins, than the regular Monster products. We also did have some increases in raw material costs, can costs, Apple juice costs, some sugar costs, sucrose went down part of the year, and high fructose went up. So, there was a mix of cost increases, but overall there was a slight increase in costs over the year and over the quarter. Going forward, we believe that Java Monster will continue to represent a higher proportion of our sales due to the success of the brand. We've launched five new flavors, which we're pretty excited about. And so, at the end of the day, we're looking at banking dollars and not at margins, and at the end of the day we'll come back to that, but the dollars are clearly very effective to the company and are continuing to increase our share of the category. In fact, If you look at the category, we're pretty much are driving the growth in the category. In the period to… end of December, the category grew about $224 million in… all out that’s combined according to Nielsen of that $224 million Red Bull was responsible for about 87, the Monster brand was responsible for about 97, Rockstar for 18, Full Throttle for 12 and Amp for about 10. So, that does give you an indication of the fact that the category is clearly being driven by Monster and Red Bull to a lesser extend, but between the two, the two brands pretty much, it's the bulk of the whole category in the direction it's going... that is going in. We also seen some increases in raw materials, going forward we think cans might go up. Apple juice concentrates may also increase, there wasn't a significant increase last year in the category, we had bought in some supplies, but we will see some increases this year going forward. Dairy products again, which are used in the Java Monster products did increase substantially from July through November, but there was a decrease in December and January. So, we're not sure of what, that's going to... how that's going to play out for the rest of this year for us. We are also seeing certain price increases that we are implementing in some of the products within the warehouse division, all being implemented. But, I do want to say, that a lot of that will also be hopefully be offset by the increased prices for the Monster 16-ounce products. You'll remember that during… about mid-year, we did increase prices of our 24-ounce products. With effect from January 1, we increased the price of Monster by about, 6 odd percent and we increased the price of Java Monster by just over, I think it is about 11%, 12% to 13%. All of those price increase have been generally accepted. We're seeing that in the trade now, one or two of our competitors are rising their prices and following that price. Red Bull had raised their pricing a little before us as well. One or two of our competitors were slightly above us and to start within the 16-ounce category, but we're dealing that more aggressively. But, our processing is now pretty much in line with that competitor. So, as also demand… other main competitors are now bringing their prices as [inaudible]. So, we're seeing no resistance from customers or consumers. I do you want to refer to the fact that there is a one-time adjustment in connection with the transition of certain of our distribution agreements we incurred termination costs amounting to $0.2 million and $3.0 million, during the three-months ended December '07 and '06 respectively. These cost amounted to $15.3 million and $12.7 million during the 12 months period ended December 31 '07 and '06. Recognized revenue totaled $0.5 million and $0.3 million, during the... recorded by the company related to newly appointed AB distributors for the costs of terminating prior distributors in the three months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. Recognized revenue amounted to $1.9 million and $400,000 during the 12-months ended December 31 for each of the respective years. In connection with the company's special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters, the company incurs special professional fees of $1.3 million of which $2.5 million was reimbursed from it's insurance careers and $3.8 million during the three months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. These costs amounted to $9.8 million and $3.8 million during the 12-months period ended December 31, '07, and '06 respectively. Operating income for the three months increased 81% to $64.6 million from $35.7 million a year ago. Excluding the identified items described above, operating income increased 50% to $63.1 million from $42.1 million a year ago. SG&A for the quarter was $61.2 million or 25% of sales, an increase of 37% in dollar terms from the $44.8 million a year ago, but decreased in percentage of sales, which was 30% in the prior year. Net income for the three months increased 103% to $45.1 million or $0.45 per diluted share from $22.2 million or $0.23 per diluted share last year. Items affecting net income include interest income in tax rate. Interest income was $3 million for the three months ended December 31, as compared to $1 million a year ago. Our effective tax rate was about 33% for the three months, the change in the tax rate was attributable to tax reductions on the section 199 of Internal Revenue Code, commencing [ph] production deduction after incorporating this deduction for the years 2005 to 2007 in our 2007 filings we received an introduction of taxes after FIN 48 adjustments of $1.9 million of approximately $3.8 million in the three months ended December 31, 2007. These strong fourth quarter results significantly added to our year-over-year performance. On the full year results, the overview, the net sales for 2007 increased 49% to $904.5 million from $605.8 million a year ago. Gross margin was 51.7% versus 52.3%, which is pretty close to each other being an average of close to 52%. Operating income increased 46% to $231 million from $158.6 million a year ago. Excluding the identified items described below operating income increased 47% to $254.1 million from $174.7 million a year ago. Net income increased 52% to $149.4 million or $1.51 per diluted share from $97.9 million or $0.99 per diluted share last year. In addition to the identified items referred to above, other items affecting net income includes interest income and expense relating to 44 [ph] penalties in the tax rate. Interest income was $8.8 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $3.7 million a year ago. A charge of $2.8 million was recorded by the company in connection with the payment to affected employees relating to Section 409A penalties that they have a willing to… related to certain stock options as a result of our prior year stock option investigation and this is... the purpose of this was to make those employees hold. Our effective tax rate was 38% for the 12 months; the change in the tax rate was attributable to the domestic production deduction as previously described. We expect our future tax rate to be approximately 38.3%, but that is a very rough figure at this point as a result of the domestic production deduction. And also I just want to point out during the year, we did have increased expenditures for stock-based compensation, largely due to a recalculation of the write-off basis for certain of the stock options that were granted by the company. In the fourth quarter, promotional allowances amounted to 12.4%, which is a reduction in the comparable quarter from last of 13.5%. On a full-year basis promotional allowances were down from 14.9% to 13.4%. These promotional allowances represent a reduction of gross sales to arrive at net sales MDF reimbursement... which comprise reimbursements to distributors and retailers, chain marking allowances for shelf space programs, invasion fees and payments to third party retailers. Decreased allowances as a percent of net sales was due to lower expenses for direct support programs between the company and its current IT distributors as compared to its prior distributor network and such decrease was partly offset by increased percentage payments to indirect convenient store customers for certain shelf programs. Distribution costs in the quarter reduced from 7% to 5.4% and in the year from 6.8% to 5.5%. Low distribution expenses were due to new co-pack as well as in areas closer to our customers, distribution centers increased cost of warehouses were more than offset by the greatest price savings. Selling expenses for the quarter totaled 16.8% versus 16.3% a year ago and on the full-year basis we were up at 16.2% versus 15.7%. The increased selling expenses were largely attributable to increased commissions and royalties, which are up 2% from 1.1% largely due to the commissions payable to AV under the AB coordination agreement and the full-year was up 0.8% to 1.6%. Sponsorships were also up, but we were more aggressive in the sponsorships and endorsements and promotion of our products and our brand. Sponsorships in the quarter were up to 3.5% from 1.4% and in the year from 1.2% to 2.8%. We just have participated in a greater number of sponsored events including riders and sporting personalities as well as actually sponsoring in some cases the actual series for example, we have just signed on all the official sponsor in the supercross series, which is now called the Monster Energy Supercross series in the U.S, which we think is a very important property for us to be associated with it [inaudible] of the whole personality and the image of the brand. We started off in that sport by sponsoring individual riders and then we went to a team in the life series and then we went to join up with the Kawasaki factory team and the senior series and in other sporting endeavors across the country including road racing on most... motorcycle road racing, the super bikes and we have taken that further because, we thought it was important that we didn't allow one of our competitors to acquire the title sponsorship of the series with… this is very much so much part of the personality and the image and the culture of the Monster brand. Consulting was up slightly in the quarter from 0.7% to 1% and in the year from 0.6% to 0.9%, just getting our products into the hands of consumers, we believe that that's good long-term planning for brand and we continue to invest in that area. Merchandise displays were up in the quarter from 1.3% to 1.6%, but down on the year from 1.9% to 1.7%. Again merchandise displays we regard is very integral and is very important part to supporting the brand at the point of sale in stores. We believe we are getting good execution from AB Distributor partners and we obviously are for that reason happy to invest in that area and in coolers [ph] etcetera. General administrative and payroll for fourth quarter was up at 5.7% from 5.2% and for the year-to-date it was down from 4.8% to 4.6%. Increased payroll includes, as I mentioned earlier, $2.8 million reserve for 409A penalties that have been or will be asset to the company's employees as well as approximately 1.8 million increase in the stock-based compensation which is a non-cash item for the… stock-based compensation for the year has increased to just over $10 million and that is as you are aware, is a non-cash item, but that's the charge that has been taken us for the year. On a division and channel basis, net sales of the DSD division for the three months ended December 31, 2007 were $224.2 million, up 72% from $130.6 million a year ago. DSD division's net sales for the 12 months ended December 31, 2007 were $809.8 million, up 58% from $514 million a year ago. Contribution margin for the DSD was 34.8% for the year or $281.6 million, an increase of 50% over the contribution of $187.8 million in 2006. In the Warehouse division, for the 12 months net sales were $94.7 million versus $91.5 million a year ago. Contribution margin was 3.9% versus 6.1%. So although sales went up slightly contribution margin due mainly to increased costs and increased promotional costs were down, primarily due to apple juice concentrate costs which was a large portion of our sales attributable to the WIC program and I'll come onto the WIC program and deal with that later. Consolidated gross sales for the quarter were... the gross sales increases were principally from Monster, Java Monster, apple juice and juice blends and juice in tetra pack. Decreases in sales were primarily attributable to reduction in lost energy sales, Joker and teas, ice teas. On a yearly basis, obviously the increases are related by Monster and Java Monster, also [inaudible] unbound, the increase in the Warehouse side was due to… attributable to increased sales primarily of apple juice and juice blends, tetra pack and in juice and Junior Juice. On the decrease side, the decrease was due to lost Joker, teas and smoothies in cans on the year basis. In terms of customer mix in the quarter, retail decreased from 11% to 8%, club store, drug chains and mass merchandises decreased from 14% to 11%. Full service distributors increased from 69% to 77% and health food distributors decreased from 2% to 1%. In the 12 months, general retailer has decreased from 12% to 8%, club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers remained constant at 14%. Full service distributors increased from 69% to 73% and health food distributors remained constant at 2%. Moving to the balance sheet, working capital has decreased from $212 million to $187 million year-on-year. Accounts receivable were $81.5 million as of December 31, down from 90 million in September and up from $47.3 million versus the year before. Day sales outstanding were 28.7 at December 31, down from 31.2 in September and up from 21... 27.1 versus the year before. On the inventory side, inventory balances were $98.1 million, as of December 31, up from $94 million in September, and up from $77 million the year before. The increase over prior year was primarily attributable to increased raw materials and finished goods related to Java Monster. Average days in inventory was 73 days as of December 31, which was slightly above the 71 days as of September, but down from the 98 days a year ago. Accounts payable balances were $56.8 million as of December 31, up from $34.4 million versus the year before. Just to deal with the... you'll notice that, cash and cash equivalents were $12 million compared to $35 million and short-term investment was $63 million compared to $101 million. Investments increased however to $227 million. Our long-term value investments are comprised of municipal or education or other public bodies related notes with an auction reset feature. These notes carry a AAA credit rating and certain other notes that are additionally backed by the various Federal Agencies and monoline insurance companies. Liquidity of these auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process, which allows holders to sell their notes and reset the applicable interest rate at predetermine intervals due… between 7 days and 35 days. The bulk, I think are pretty much in the 28-day range. In February, throughout this year, a large portion of the auctions for these auction rate securities around the U.S. failed. There is no assurance that these auctions on the remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will succeed. The auction failures appear to be attributable to inadequate positive volume demand in the event that there is fair auction, the indenture governing these securities generally require the issue out to pay interest at default rate that is above the market rates for similar instruments. These securities with these auctions have filed, will continue to accrue interest at the predetermined default rates and be auctioned every 7 days to 35 days until the auction succeeds. The issuer holds [ph] the securities because of the higher interest rates, because less attractive to them, they mature or we are able to sell them in… to third parties and there is a safe new market that has started develop in these securities. As a result, our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of auction rate securities in the near term may be limited. Consequently, these securities have been classified as long-term investment in our consolidated financial institution statement. However we anticipate that, due to the higher rates now payable on certain of these securities for various other reasons, the issuers will take steps to refine the notes to enable them to call and repay the securities and therefore avoid the higher interest rates. If they were unable to refinance [inaudible] and call the note, we will successfully close future auctions and the [inaudible] impairment charge on these investments, but we maybe required to wait until market stabilities restore for these instruments or until the final maturity of the underlying notes to realize our investments. This is a feature that's currently now... it's going right throughout the commercial world, everybody in commerce were investing the short-term money... available monies in these notes that were AAA and still are AAA rated. From our point of view, it's fortunate that we don't need these funds for immediate operating expenses. We have some 75 million in cash or visa via available cash with companies continuing to generate profits. And so consequently, we... our working capital requirements getting forward will not require us to even get to the cash, resources, reserves we have, we do also have a line in place. But I just wanted to obviously point that out and explain that to investors and we think that it will take a couple of months and then we think that things will start rectifying themselves in the market. It is just very early days... this has only occurred a couple of weeks ago and people are just trying to sought out what and how to deal with this. But it's something that as I said that we don't do and don’t believe will affect our operating performance going forward or affect the company in anyway. Some of our previously mentioned highlights, we have continued with our international growth goals in the UK. These are on track. We have now appointed a distributor in the United Kingdom for the Off-Premise channel. We are also working with... there is a three or four main distributors to get to the On-Premise channel. We have agreement in principle with one of the main On-Premise routes to market for their own customer base, but also possibility to handle us as a distributor for... with regard to the rest of the market and that should be put in place shortly. We have started to put to together an organization of individuals of sale team and marketing team in the UK. We have offices and we are starting to make presentations to selected retail customers and starting to go out to the market. We're starting something, we have undertaken, we conclude some marketing support arrangements in Europe and the UK, principally related to the motorcycle world, which is pretty much the trademark of our brand and as you are aware and we have... we've actually signed a agreement for MotoGP, which is international with the Kawasaki factory team. We think that that... while that reaches far broader than the UK; it will set the bases and create awareness for our brand throughout Europe, which is obviously where we're going to go next. MotoGP is probably the... one of the top three sports, watched sport in... popular sport in Europe and in fact certainly is one of the most popular sports for our demographic for our product. So we think that was a great achievements and although we are… it is technically premature to have done that, you got obviously be able to show the retailers in the UK and Europe that you see [inaudible] you all going to go to the... you all going there and you tend to support your brand. So it was essential for us and we were very unfortunate to be able to conclude that arrangement. We were also in the final phase of concluding a number of other sponsorships in Supercross, Motocross, Superbike, very similar sports to what we are... we've concentrated on here. We're also going to do some music events in the UK this year and we will be concentrating largely... a larger amount of our efforts on sampling, which has always worked out well for us. So, the UK, we... by the end of the quarter we will... we believe we'll starting, we will be actually starting to sell into retail channels in the U.K., and then we're going to look to… obviously looking further as we start establishing ourselves there, we'll be looking to beyond the borders of the U.K. We've also started to sell our products in South Africa. We've opened a distributor, although it's small, it is starting to do very nicely. Initial indications are the products are moving off the shelves and which is good news for us. As previously announced we dedicating [ph] the school, we did implement the previously announced price increases, effective as of January, that has gone through, and what has happened is that obviously we'll talk about the volume. We believe, estimate that the volume was between 7% and 8%, as indicated earlier due to the planned price increases. This translates to about $21.5 million and the importance to this is also to describe our sales for 2008, the first couple of two months. Our new product pipeline, we obviously are focusing on our five new flavors of Java Monster, mix that we launched in December, mix which is the juice based product similar to chaos and MIT [ph] and also, our product which is Heavy Metal, which we launched in a 32 ounce cans only at this time. We are obviously also looking at possible line extensions and additional products going down the line, but these are things I don't want to go into more at this stage. On the Hansen Natural side, we all are continuing to... with the roll out and of the new sparkling beverages in 10.5 ounce sleek cans, which we are, we think have got a great future. It's a slow ball and we will continue to do so, and focus on those products. The WIC contracts... we are… terminates in July, we are in fact negotiating with the government, with the state to... for a slightly earlier termination. That contract at the moment because of the increased apple juice cost has been in fact incurring losses for us, and so we would like to obviously terminate that contract at an earlier date. Going forward, we understand that WIC won't be granting the same sort of exclusive contracts, they will be granting a nice piece of contracts, and that may also change the mix of products that are eligible for WIC-to-WIC participants to include more fruit products, fresh fruits and vegetable products, which will in fact slightly reduce the available $1.2 [ph] that's been allocated to WIC participants for juice products. So, we anticipate going forward that we will be to participate in the WIC programs whether they are going to be lead to fund. But ourselves, obviously, we anticipate we'll be lower from WIC. We do not believe however that that will have material effect on our results, because A, there will be substantial rebates although the dollar value of the sales growth on WIC are high, the net sales arising from WIC are very much lower and being very marginal, they've served a purpose, they've made our brand much more familiar to a broader base of consumers, which is one of our principle mottos in going into the WIC program, which we think has been achieved. But going forward, we believe that the effect of us simply participating and the non-exclusive WIC program will not, while it may reduce gross sales, it won't really affect the bottom line very much at all. The Monster's cannibalization issue obviously, we have referred to it on a number of occasions, we did experience, we believe we've experienced cannibalization on our Monster brand with Java Monster, we are continuing now to get resets for our Java Monster products, either full shows in some cases two shows, and otherwise but good shows space in the coffee door, particularly with the introduction of the additional Java products that’s going to make it much more difficult for salesmen and still close to actually simply take the easy route out and cut them into our Monster space. There are too many of them now, so they really do deserve their own space and we believe we will be more successful in securing, separate space which we believe will minimize the cannibalization going forward. If one looks at the Nielsen numbers, generally what has happened is, the Nielsen numbers are showing a 52% increase for the 13-weeks to the end of December, [inaudible] 52.5 for the 13-weeks ended January as opposed to a category growth of 26, and 24. What happened is that, a portion of that has obviously come from Java Monster, which has cannibalized our existing sales, but Monster on its own excluding Java Monster is still growing at or slightly above the industry average, despite the cannibalization and excluding Java. So again, if you look at some of the leading individual SKUs, Monster itself as an individual SKU, just the single 16-ounce, has continued to grow at slightly… at/or slightly above the category whereas the leading brand or the leading products fledge of products of our competitors have in fact grown at lower than the category. If you take Rockstar, they grew at minus... the leading product was actually negative... sorry, grew only 2.5... sorry, grew a negative 2.5%, Red Bull is difficult to tell, because [inaudible] and they introduced 12 of 16, Full Throttle’s flagship brand was down 15%, Amp was down 0.5% which is flat and against that we were up 25% on our flagship brand, we think that’s an important indicator of the strength of the brand, because despite the substantial line extensions, despite the extensions of the whole Java, introduction of whole Java Monster launch, we're still getting growth equal to the category growth for our 16-ounce flagship product. Sales going forward, we normally give sales information regarding the first month of... we haven't yet finished the month of February, because we're a day away, we also don't often know our sales numbers until we actually... can actually get a better handle on deliveries. But I thought that in the light of the fact that we did have... we believe it's our estimate that we had about 21.5 million volume in December, that is important to look at what the results are coming through January or February, and to give you the results for February even though they are very rougher than… more estimated than normal. Sales for January and February are up about 33% on last year. If one then takes into account... during the two months... and the reason is the two months is that, I think some of the volumes actually will have translated not only into January, but also into February. So, and that is why didn't just look at the comparison for January, because that would... I think, so or tend to indicate too high an increase in sales, which because I think some of it's clearly going to February. So if we take it into February, the increase is about 52% year-on-year for the company, as 90% roughly of the sales of Monster, that is pretty much in line with the numbers we've been seeing out of Nielsen, which is sell through the retail price. So that's outselling, so that sort of, does sort of... get the numbers to sort of hang together the company seems to be continuing to increase its Monster sales basically through the year-end and through the New year at just about the 50% level, which is very encouraging for us, because there has been a slight fall off in percentage wise in the energy category over the past six months, just a gradual sort of fall off as the category continues to grow and larger in size and mature. And in that regard, I just wanted want to also relate the fact that, stress again that obviously we believe we bank dollars and not percentages, but if you look at the energy category in the all outlets combined the actual dollar increase a year ago was about a $147 million in the 13-week period ended December last year. In the first quarter of this year it was up to 151, I just did have the figures handy for the second quarter. The third quarter increased to $191 million, and the fourth quarter increased by $224 million in dollars, I referred to that figure earlier in this call. So the category is continuing to grow in real dollars terms. What's also very important is that there are… more so for this category than other beverages are the unmeasured channels, the unmeasured channels are the small mum and pop's, the dairies, the non-China accounts, the club stores, and some of the drugs at Wal-Mart and Sams, which don't report in. So these are only very rough indicators, we really do try and give to you is giving you some pointers, but we really do caution that investors should not pay over importance or give over importance to… too much importance to the Nielsen numbers. They are only indicators and they also don't cover the whole category. So far for the New Year we are very encouraged, we are very encouraged with the category still growing and we are encouraged with Monster's performance and its ability to maintain its share of market and continue to grow market share, and generally we are pretty bullish for the company. I would like to now open the floor to questions. Question and Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel Nicolaus.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Hi, good mornings guys… good afternoon, guys.
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Hi Mark.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: I guess first place to start is from an SG&A standpoint; you talked about your higher selling and sponsorship expenses. How should we think about that on an ongoing basis? Is this going to run though 2008, is that more of a step-up on a quarter-by-quarter basis. I guess just a little additional color there in terms of your spending and promotion ideas going forward.
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: I think there was a step up Mark on the year numbers. I think the quarter was probably out of line with the historical quarter or going forward. It is just when some of the accounts or some of the charges hit or fall to the through the bottom line. But going forward on an annual basis, we believe that we probably will stay in line with what we've done for '07, ’08 will be pretty much in line. Some of the costs of doing business, there is a lot of competition. Lot of our competitors are just blindly following us into a number of these categories and offering higher amounts to athletes and to events to try and secure them and that has put up the cost of doing business in some of these categories. And we've just got to step up to it. And, so we believe going forward sponsorships just knowing what our plans are… are going to probably be more in line with last year.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Got it okay.
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: That is the main thing. Again, going forward with sampling will probably be very, which is another reasonably high cost item which will be pretty much in line and merchandise displays we think will probably come down slightly.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, great. And then shifting over to the shelves space. I guess, my question is you are in the process of resetting some of these shelves to give Java incremental space. One, where are we in that process? And then two is, when it is completed which I guess that has to be sometime March, April time frame, what kind of incremental space like as a percent of new space is incremental versus what you have. So if you were going to add 10% or 15%. I mean, what is that absolute number?
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: It is very difficult because at the moment what happened is in the case of Java we have no space, historically additional space. So we get a shelf in the coffee door that is if we probably got, in most accounts if you take all of the different products in convenience we probably got three to four shelves. So we are going to get an additional shelf, so that's an addition 20%. But its in a different door where velocity may be different, although the velocity so far on the Java Monster products has been comfortable to all of our other… to other supporting products in the Monster line, in fact it has exceed some of the juice product on a [inaudible] basis. So that will be we believe will be incremental and that's, there will be some change in which we will get two shelves, there will be some change in which we get a half or three quarters of a shelf. But on average we're probably more likely to be getting closer to one shelf in the coffee door. In regard to the Monster door itself, in that door we generally have been able to negotiate again larger space, because we are clearly under spaced in relation to our competitors. We have at the moment similar space to Rockstar, but we sell more than double their sales. So, ultimately we are getting additional space and they are being received. I don't have enough to give you a percentage, but certainly we will be getting between a half and a full shelf extra for our general Monster products generally as a rule. So overall, we think that we probably will get 25% to 30% more space is a pretty good estimate, but again that’s a very much a thumb suck and its not something that we've been able to accurately determine or haven't accurately determined.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. The 25% to 30% incrementally are you...
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: [inaudible] between the two rates.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Are you to be paying incremental plotting fees for that?
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Yes, we will. We pay CMAs, we do try pay for the incremental space. In some cases it is on a straight proportionate basis, in some cases in order to incentivize the store to actually give you an additional space you may will play a slightly higher rate across the whole… across all the show that you have, then you obviously… obviously becomes a determination as to where that the incremental shelf space is really incremental or not, it may, again, reduce your, increase your actual allowance percentage for a case, but you hopefully will sell more cases again it goes back to the question of percentage versus actual dollars, because we believe that the increased shelf space will translate into increased sales which will more than offset that cost, but it may not be as effective, the last dollar you spend may not be as effective as the first dollar. But again, its a question, it's done on a chain-by-chain basis and it's… the chains, just look at these things very differently.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. So, that is a positive though?
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, we believe so, and that's why we will continue to grab that additional visibility and additional shelf space, yes.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, great. And then, from a gross margins standpoint, can you talk a bit about... you touched on the outlook a little bit, but I guess there are things that we're hearing it terms of what you could potentially be doing, like you cut your freight cost a bit, there may be some outsourcing of production elsewhere, can you talk a bit about what kind of impact do you think you have there, be able to cut cost or do you think that what we saw in the quarter maybe be a more likely number going forward?
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. We think that the amount in the quarter is probably more likely to be, more representative going forward, but that will be offset partly by the increased prices that we've been able to get, but again you've also got a change in the product mix and a slight change may be in raw material cost increases which include our Juice products, includes cans etcetera. By and large we would be quite satisfied that we could maintain a gross margin in the 51% range, but we are not sure where it will be. I just don't have a bit a handle on that and it really would be very much a guess work for us to think that we can improve it, but obviously we would hope to do so, but we think that that's probably a gain, we are on it… that is pretty much being, with all those factors being able to maintain gross margins closer to the average for the year, last year and maintain them going forward in that 51% range.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Great, thank you.
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from Dara Mohsenian from JP Morgan.
Dara Mohsenian - J.P. Morgan: Good afternoon, guys.
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Good afternoon. Hi.
Dara Mohsenian - J.P. Morgan: I just want to get a bit more clarity on Java, can you give us a sense for where it's tracking as a percentage of Monster sales so far in 2008 and what level do you think you can eventually get there?
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: In the… as I indicated early, in the fourth quarter it was about 13% of sales. In the first two months… I doubt whether we've got our monthly figure, I don't have that figure handy. I will try and get that figure for you, I'll come back to you on that number.
Dara Mohsenian - J.P. Morgan: In terms of long-term expectations, where do you think the brand can get to?
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: We really don't know, it's a very unusual brand, its obviously flying and it's primary focus, our primary focus for the brand is to obviously go after the company statement which has been unchallenged by Starbucks and we think there is opportunity there to, A, take some share from Starbucks and, B, to increase the actual sales of that carrier by offering these different products in different formats and in different functions, but it also has the energy attribute to it, which we believe will take some of the energy sold from the energy category. We believe there will be some cannibalization, but we are hoping that it will come from the energy category as a whole as opposed to primarily from Monster where we think... what we had experienced in the past six months. But going forward, we do believe that... we're quite excited about the growth. There is a continued growth and strength we are seeing in that category and we think that it could possibly come up to the 20% range. But that is very much a guess. We don't like giving a direction going forward. We don't normally give any estimates because of the fact that it is such a guess and it's very much... we are into uncharged waters here, we really don't know. But based on the first year-to-date numbers, it's heading into the high-teens, and it could either stay around there or get up even high, as I said, towards that 20% mark. But it's probably going to be in the high-teens to the 20% mark, it is our best estimate at this time.
Dara Mohsenian - J.P. Morgan: Okay. That's helpful. And do you still have production constrains on Java at this point?
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: There are some constrains, but they have largely... we are largely being met on our production requirements now. And as we have gone through some of the winter months there was a sort of a... we think that the winter months did affect Java perhaps a bit more seasonally that traditional Monster beverages. We're all going to build a little bit of inventories, so that we can make sure that we... to try and obviously avoid any shortage in the summer as it that ramps up. So we can try many Java production in that way. There should be some additional production coming on stream towards midyear. So we do believe that production constrains won't be a problem.
Dara Mohsenian - J.P. Morgan: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: We will move now to Jacqueline Rider with Lazard Capital Markets.
Jacqueline Rider - Lazard Capital Markets: Good afternoon.
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Good afternoon, hi
Jacqueline Rider - Lazard Capital Markets: I was wondering the price increases that you put in place for 11, how quickly were those adopted across all of your channels? I mean, this every store that sells Monster has the price increases on 11 or was there some rolling period?
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: We didn't see that price translating on the retail prices straightaway. They seem to have held pretty close to the previous pricing. So we're not sure how much they all going to go up at all. They may not go up very much at all. There may be very... stick to where they are, because I think I have mentioned in previous calls that on our products, the retailers are generally earning substantially better margins than they are earning on competitive product, including Red Bull, for example, in the energy category and Starbucks in the coffee category. Our products do deliver more margin percentage wise and dollar wise to retailers. So they were able already take advantage of the fact that the elasticity of the product was such that consumer demand didn't fall off even though we had originally targeted a 199 to 209 pricing for Monster. They were able to take that up to averages of 219, 229 to setting out, without seeing any fall off in demand and so they are really were making additional margins north of 40%. So we haven't seen that been translated, but so far as our costings to customers that has obviously been put into effect.
Jacqueline Rider - Lazard Capital Markets: Okay. So how quickly were you... you were benefiting from the price increase as of when?
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: We will start benefiting from the beginning of the year subject to the volume which obviously gave us a slight depression in sales in the first two months. The one cause of customer that didn't go up, I think more quickly, is probably the club stores and then possibly the grocery channel, which is not the biggest channel for us, but they would have probably translated the pricing into the shelf space, onto the shelves a little more quick, they will do that more quickly than we think the convenience channel.
Jacqueline Rider - Lazard Capital Markets: Okay, great. And then, are you hedging any of these commodity cost?
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: We haven't. We're looking at it. But we haven't at this stage.
Jacqueline Rider - Lazard Capital Markets: But at this point, you've noticed, I mean you have seen that dairy prices have fallen of the cliff in March. So, how often do you buy milk?
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: It's done, its priced regularly, literally monthly for us.
Jacqueline Rider - Lazard Capital Markets: Okay.
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: And so, last year we had a price increase in Java. It did squeeze our margins, we did had some relief in December-January. It will come down now which is… which was good that we didn't hedge. But it may go up again, it is pretty volatile dairy process depending on demand, depending on weather and a whole lot of other factors.
Jacqueline Rider - Lazard Capital Markets: Yeah, okay. And then how much of the pull in of sales, the 20… I lost the number, $21.5 million that you're talking about came into the fourth quarter. How much of that do you estimate was Java versus your traditional [inaudible]?
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: We think it was mainly the traditional products, because Java was very difficult to tell, what the value was because that was a new product, we need to compare it against. And then there were some shortages because of deliveries and some production issues in November, the Java Monster sales November were much lower than in October, and we believe that then there was a, they were orders waiting for delivery which were brought in December. So, we just, very little of that is attributable to Java.
Jacqueline Rider - Lazard Capital Markets: I find that curious in that your margins were so depressed even though you are bringing in… pulling in and sales of our 16-ounce Monster, I would have expected you to have more Java being sold.
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: There was more Java. But what I'm saying to you is that I don't... we don't know what percentage of the Java was attributable in that month, was attributable to the price increase, because when we look at January and February, the Java Monster numbers have been pretty healthy. And we don't have any [inaudible] Java was only introduced midyear.
Jacqueline Rider - Lazard Capital Markets: Okay.
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: And then, we also had the other disrupting feature that in November, the Java Monster sales was substantially lower because for certain production reasons, we weren't able to, we had a whole product on hold for a period of time, longer than normal which resulted in, not being able to meet certain deliveries. So, those deliveries, those orders were placed and we obviously didn't start to deliver them in December. And so there was some pent-up demand in December from November.
Jacqueline Rider - Lazard Capital Markets: All right that is fair. And then on your tax rate that you've mentioned, the 38.3%, which is your best guess for next year, should we just flat line that across the year, or should we kind of put more of that… what should we do taxes for 2008?
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: I think it is flat line, that’s probably the safest way.
Jacqueline Rider - Lazard Capital Markets: And then last question, in the U.K., do you expect to have a lot...how much product or how many… is there a number you can give us on how much shelf space or how many stores you are going to get into?
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Absolutely called. I mean it is really...it's at a very early stage, we think that the category in the U.K. is about 300, and probably nearly 400 million cans, which is about a pound a can, that's about 40 million. It's about $400 million to $500 million and then if you take [inaudible] you got about $800 million to $900 million, just short of $1 billion category in the U.K., and obviously we think that there is a weaker than… secure a decent percentage of that, but, you know it's very premature we're… at the beginning we don't know exactly how the brand will be accepted, we don't know how quickly we'll get the listing. So, we really don't have any idea, we know that, we feel good about the fact that we will get listings in the… all the major gas stations and in the major grocery chains and the major liquid [ph] club stores, the wholesalers like Bookers and Bestway and we think that we all making a strong push in the on-premise there, which is a… in England, the on-premise for Red Bull percentage appears to be substantially higher than the percentage in other countries. And so, we're obviously focusing as well on the on-premise, but we really don't have an idea at this time of what the numbers will be like.
Jacqueline Rider - Lazard Capital Markets: Alright. Thank you very much.
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: From UBS you have a question with Sunil Jayawalla [ph].
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. Hi, Rodney.
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Hi, how are you doing?
Unidentified Analyst: May be first if you could just help with what volumes look like in the fourth quarter?
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Yes. I'll just find it now. Sorry, I'll hopefully will get this…
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. No problem, may be we can move on, I'll just ask you quickly if you want to give an update on Canada?
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Canada has done very nicely. Our sales more than doubled. We are getting additional product SKUs into Canada and we're very satisfied with the relationship with Pepsi there that certainly has helped us step up and compete with the other brands and we are already pretty close to being the number two in the country. So, that's going very well for us. In Mexico again, it's been a challenge in getting to some of the outlying areas of the sub-distributors, it's a very undeveloped sort of system and… but we all, we believe we are the number two in that market and sales are doing very nicely in Mexico as well. I've got the volume numbers, volume in the fourth quarter; unit case volume was 25.657 million cases compared to 17.454 million in the previous quarter. On an annual basis for the year, the total cases was 98.453 versus 72.74, average price per case in the quarter was $9.61 versus $8.67 a year ago and average price for the year per case was 9.19 versus 8.33.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, thank you.
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Unidentified Analyst: And then quickly, can you just give us an update on the transition to AB Distributors, there were some issues like as the AB folks getting into the non-alcoholic accounts, I was wondering if you could give an update or talk about how that's progressed?
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: We're already just dealing with that on a market-by-market basis. It is being addressed; we are working with individual AB Distributors. Some of the distributors who are more… see the lot more or able to do more that some are more competitive than others, but it certainly is improving, looking at our numbers on our AB Distributor… portion of our distributor network, sales are increasing in most of their markets and there are one or two anomalies, we are addressing them but they are starting to move up, we had some weak markets in the transition. But, I don't want to go into… to describe the actual markets, but there were one or two weak markets and they actually all turning around, we are starting to make some progress.
Unidentified Analyst: Would you say that in the AB markets you are growing faster than the non-AB markets or would you say--.
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: I can't say, I think it is an unfair comparison because many of the AB markets were slightly more under developed markets and so, when you look at real percentages, you probably will see that they've grown in percentage terms more but I'm not sure that’s a result purely of being AB versus non-AB. I mean there is no doubt that the AB distributors are professionals, they are good and that certainly helped contribute to the increase. But it's also been helped by the fact that in many of the cases they were handed territories that were underdeveloped with a lot more heavy lifting. But the fact the opportunity was, it's lot easier to take 7% or 8% or 9% market where we are nationally at 24% and turn that to 16% to 18% than it is to take a 22% market and 23% and turn that to 25%, 26%.
Unidentified Analyst: I see. Okay great. That's all I have. Thank you.
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Next we will hear from Andrew Sawyer with Goldman Sachs.
Andrew Sawyer - Goldman Sachs: Hi Rodney, I was wondering if you could elaborate a bit on any perspective you are getting from retailers on the price increase. Are you seeing any delistings in any clubs or mass outlet like Costco for instance or anything like that?
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: No. We are not, we have explained the reasons, we haven't had a price increase for... since we launched Monster seven years or six years ago and we haven't had that we think the retailers have understood our issues and we have been able to work through that with the retailers and that's, it has been well received and understood by them.
Andrew Sawyer - Goldman Sachs: On the dealing back front, you said you are dealing back a bit more, is that... how much of the price increases that eating back up, can you give us a sense?
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: I think my comment in that regard was in fact addressed to one of our competitors. One of the competitors always had their frontline pricing $2 a case above ours.
Andrew Sawyer - Goldman Sachs: Okay.
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: They were dealing back more aggressively on their product in order to bring it into line effectively more effectively with ours, and some of our competitors, we think what I would say was we think they will not deal as deeply now because we moved our pricing to their frontline pricing and certain of our other competitors have moved their pricing up. So, generally the pricing has moved up and even Red Bull’s [inaudible] also moved up may be not the same again, but they've all moved up.
Andrew Sawyer - Goldman Sachs: And then just shifting gears on Rockstar, we're seeing that brand start to turnover. Do you have any... can you give us a sense on what do think is going there, it seems like they've lost some distribution can you just kind of elaborate and how much of that you think you are picking up?
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: I'm not sure it's a question of loss of distribution, I think they lost some distributors on the East, I think Coke… consolidated decided to drop Rockstar, they have gone to an independent network there. I think that's a brand though has just slowed in and of itself. I think there has been a lot of push behind the brand, a lot of effort by CCE but we think that the brand is just slow, they have not done things that are original. They had really just done whatever we've done and copied us. So, we came out with Java Monster and they just followed us blindly with the exact... three products in similar color cans and just did the same thing. We think that their products aren't as good as ours and we think we'll beat them in the market on the products. But that's what really happened. And I think that the consumer is seeing that there isn't any originality coming from them and any innovation. And even in their supports now, there is a mix message going out I mean they were a brand that was marketed in a very different way to ours and market position but they seem to be seeing our success and just simply blindly following us now saying going into our sort of sports and our category in just simply basically paying some cases we believe pretty stupid money for trying to get athletes in the in our sports and to try and make a dent there, we think that sends a mixed message to their consumers, because their consumer dose know what their brand stands for. So, we think that's been partly responsible for the fact that there has been a slight fall off in [inaudible] and they haven been able to really maintain this share despite increasing… introducing a number of new SKUs and a lot of effort from CCE as their distributor.
Andrew Sawyer - Goldman Sachs: Then, just two other quick ones. On the UK, it doesn't sound like the launch you are going to have a couple or more months. Could you give us a sense for how much the start up cost are going to be in the first couple of quarters of the year before you give any revenue?
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: I think the start up, in the fourth quarter were approximately $35000 that we have incurred, as going forward we will incur some more cost but pretty shortly those costs are going to start to be offset by margin on sale. At this stage we've obviously not had the sales, we’ve had all the expenses and we hope that by… by certainly by mid year which will start being contributing and hopefully we believe we will be able to break even or make it us more profit by the end of the year. But we will have to see what the sales velocities are as we get listings as they come through during the year.
Unidentified Analyst: And just quickly can you give quick update on on-premise any successor like there, just how you are doing in getting listings against Red Bull and what is the outlook is for that into 2008?
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: We're quite confident about the on-premise, but it is going to be a slow ball. Red Bull has taken a pretty aggressive defensive stance to the two unexpected foray into the on-premise. They’ve gone in and tried to secure longer-term contracts, they've upped the NT [ph] on contracts. But we all having success, it is just too premature for me to relate some of them to you guys, we were at the point where we have signed or about to sign some decent contracts, very nice contracts, but we think that it would be wrong to send that message in advance, it's just not from a competitive point of view wouldn't be appropriate. So, but it's a slow ball, we've also changed our own formula and how we are dealing with it and how we working with AB, we are working two things, we are evolving the systems and you know it is working but its a slow ball than its… to get into, it is not going to be with [inaudible] short period obviously Red Bull are going to surrender it easily. So, but we all… we are confident that we all going start making gains in that area. And they will come and I do hope that by the time we have our next call in May we will able to share a lot more success in the on-premise side with you.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you very much guys.
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Next will go to Alton Stump from Longbow Research.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Thank you good afternoon Rodney.
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Good afternoon.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: I had two quick questions, first off, in looking at the fourth quarter sales number again, even if you need to be strip out the buyer hit, it looks like an awfully solid number that you showed stronger growth in the last two months versus the number that you gave for October which of courses you had a benefit from a pull back of volumes from the 3Q, I was trying maybe get some color is that essentially in your estimate mostly due to Java selling better than expected or is there something else going on that is driving that?
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: No. I think the Monster business itself is doing well. I mean Monster itself… if you look at the convenience of some of the channels that we've looked at, where we take the Java Monster numbers out of it. Monster itself is growing at or slightly above the category growth. And that's despite the fact that, obviously we are seeing some cannibalization of Monster products into Java Monster because that we put on to the same shelf. So we're seeing growth still coming clearly from Monster itself.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Okay. Thank you. And then I guess just a two-part question in terms of price increase on Java. First off, if you could maybe give an estimate if you can as to how much of that total $21.5 million in 4Q might have been for Java? And then also where you think gross margins could potentially go?
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: We have allocated very little to Java Monster in that calculation.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Okay. All right. And then in terms of the gross margins of Java, could you may be give us a ballpark estimate as to where you think margins might go after the price increase, which… if you've gone through successfully?
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Java Monster has started off being in the sort of numbers, we are in the low 40s and because of the increase in dairy, they sort of dipped below that. With the price increase, we believe that we will get it into the mid-to-upper 40s, going forward again, but very much dependent on the dairy. The dairy component is a high component in the Java Monster products. They are... they do reduce fresh milk, fresh cream etcetera, and for that reason it is a high component cost. So depending on what happens with dairy prices, we may find in the next couple of months, you may find it, it in fact improves and goes closer to 50, but then we do believe that, again, it was stated forever and we think dairy prices will fluctuate and when it comes down, it will be in the mid 40s. And that's about... if we can maintain those sort of margins as an average for this product we would be very satisfied, meanings that, that will certainly be very... it will contribute to the overall profitability very handsomely of the company. But again, it does put a little pressure on your overall gross margin.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Okay, great. Thank you.
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Thanks.
Operator: And it appears that’s all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Sacks for closing remarks.
Rodney C. Sacks – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Thank you. Once again, I wanted to thank everybody for attending the call. I think that we all see some challenging times; the economy has clearly slowed down. And then I think food traffic has slowed down in convenience channels, particularly. However, that may be one of the reasons we... that we suspect. But don't know that we have seen a little fall off in percentage sales increases in the energy category, which are still growing at healthy rates, but there has been this gradual drop off and that might be attributable not so much for the category material, but even to the economy or a mix of the two. But this is in line with other consumer retailers, probably… we probably will feel a little less than them. But obviously we think we're not immune to it. But overall, despite this we are continuing to see really good growth in the brand, we are still growing at north of 50%, which is very, very exciting for us, very amount that we already are such a big part of the category and as you can see from the numbers that I alluded to earlier in real dollar terms, we are actually leading the category growth. We are, the category growth. And so we are looking forward to an exciting 2008, we think that the products we introduced in the fourth quarter, that's the five Java products plus the two Monster products or both… all going to be incremental both lines, we think that we are going to continue to also innovate and that we will probably be launching something, I can't give you that for certainty, but all I could, we will be increasing, launching additional Monster products this year and we are all very encouraged by the fact that we have been able despite the current economics talk and discussion and slowdown that we been able to continue increase ourselves north of 50%. So we are very bullish for the year and obviously we are excited, we think that we will also start to make inroads into the on-premise and overseas and they… we are just going to be patient, they will come and they will… we want to do them right. And we believe that in the long-term those markets are going to be very important for us, both locally and internationally for the growth of the brand and the company. So again we thank for your attendance and look forward to talking with you again when you release our first quarter results. Thank you.
Operator: Again that does conclude our conference. We do thank you for joining us.

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 52%, for both the nine months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 respectively. Operating income for nine months ended September 30, 2007 advanced 35.6% to $166.7 million from $122.9 million a year ago. Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 excluding the identified expense items described below, increased 45.3% to $192.7 million from $132.7 million a year ago. Net income for the nine months increased 37.7% to $104.3 million or $1.06 per dilution share from $75.7 million or $0.77 per diluted share last year. In connection with the transition of certain Anheuser distribution arrangements, we incurred termination costs amounting to $300,000 and $9.5 million during three months ended September 30, 2007 to 2006 respectively to certain of our prior distributors. We incurred termination costs amounting to $15 million and $9.8 million respectively during the nine months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 to prior distributors. Those costs are, and have been, expensed in full and are included in operating expenses for the three and nine months, non refundable amounts totaling $1.3 million, $12.3 million were recorded by the company related to newly appointed Anheuser-Busch distributors for cost of terminating prior distributors in the three months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 respectively, and nonrefundable amount amounting totaling $21.1 million and $12.3 million were recorded by the company related to those distributors for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 respectively.  These payments have been accounted for and commitments have been accounted for deferred revenue and are being recognized relatively over the 20 year anticipated lives of the respected Anheuser-Busch distribution agreements. The amount of written were recognized as $0.5 million and $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 respectively. In connection with the company's special investigation of stock option grants and practices and related litigation, the company incurred professional service fees of $0.1 million, net of $0.8 million insurance reimbursements and $11 million net of $0.8 million insurance reimbursements for the three and nine months in the September which have also been fully expensed. These items are set out in the table in the announcement. If I can then turn to just initially gross profit: Gross profit percentage, as you'll note, came in very nicely at 51.9% and 52% year-to-date. Factors affecting gross profits include the increased product mix to DSD products from 83% to close to 88% for quarter. That was positive. The negative was in the DSD segment where the increased sales mix of Java, which is at a substantially lower margin, and also negative due to certain increases in raw materials. On the other side there were some increased margins that we were able to achieve on the warehouse division.  Going forward, gross profit percentages will be affected and the main factors will be possibly the higher mix of Java Monster products. We are seeing some increases in certain raw materials, particularly dairy products and apple juice concentrate. Dairy particularly has gone up in the last six months or so and we're looking to see how we can try and obviously lock in some pricing for next year. We are planning some price increases for some of our products, and in this regard we are planning a price increase for Java Monster around the beginning of the year. We feel that the brand is pulling, it is selling very well. I'll come on to that a bit later. With the increased cost of the actual product, and it is in the margin to start, we obviously swallowed that and we actually put the product out at a price that we thought was not too high and we were obviously trying to gauge the consumer response. We believe that we've been getting good pricing at the retail level, which has not had a much of a premium to the regular Monster. But since we launched the product, we have had increases in dairy, which is quite an expensive component in the product and, with the already thin margins from the start, we made the decision to increase pricing of Java Monster going forward in the New Year. We're launching a number of new products, which I will come to, in Java Monsters. So, all in all, we think that it is appropriate and we don't think that will affect the product. We believe that in any case there should be some price distinction in order to one of the factors that will help us minimize cannibalization from existing Monster consumers to Java Monster. Just looking to some selected sales information: obviously the main increase in sales is attributable to Monster. Java Monster also came in very much ahead of our expectations. One of the limitations we had in the quarter in Java Monster was production. Java Monster sales were just over 10% of the sales of Monster in the quarter. We also had some increases in sales of apple juice and juice blends and in tetra pack juice product. Some of the decreases that we had [inaudible] as a brand, which has sort of suffered some reductions in sales and we are taking steps to address that. Joker, Ace and Unbound are all products on the Allied product side where we have seen a falloff in sales, which has been disappointing and we’re looking at decisions on what we do with those lines and how we address them going forward. We're still very happy with the Rumba line; we think that it has got some legs. But going forward we've got to make some decisions as to whether we concentrate primarily on Monster, obviously, and then on Rumba. And that seems to be a direction we possibly will head in a year, but we haven't yet made any final decisions on the other Allied brands. We wanted to see what we should, or shouldn't, do with those going forward.  They sell, and there is a proper contribution, but I think that we are probably allocating too many resources to them and we could have those resources better spent both on a sales and marketing level; we think with the principal and main brands. Just talking about Lost, we still think Lost is a great brand. It has got a good positioning; it's still one of the leading brands in the country. What we have done is we have launched a new product; we're just about to launch it called Lost Cadillac. It's, sort of, a margarita mix type of flavored product, but we also have redesigned all of the cans in the Lost line. We think that they will appeal to a broader spectrum of consumer and we're going to test the new cans with the full line, launching that in Florida first. We are launching Cadillac in the new graphics nationally, and then, as we get to work through out existing inventory of cans in Lost, we will introduce the new packages into the rest of the markets in the U.S. going forward. So there will be four products in the Lost line. We're also planning to increase an additional flavor in the Rumba product line, the 100% non-carbonated juice line. We think that that brand has got some legs as well and it's selling nicely. We think that with an additional SKU, it will give it more visibility and presence in the juice shelf and will help the brand overall. And we are going to introduce a new product at beginning of the New Year in the Rumba line. Just going through some of the actual financial details, promotional allowances, you'll see reduced from 13.5% to 12.4% in the comparable quarters and year-to-date basis reduced from 15.4% to 13.8%. The MDF was reduced considerably as a percentage and we had an increase in chains we had made which is really shelf space programs with the chains. That did go up as a percentage, but overall the actual number is down. This includes increased invasion fees which we will pay to distributors for certain customers who we sell to direct, which also was up substantially, about double on last year. So, total allowances on the reclassification came off resulting in a higher net increase in sales versus gross.  With regard to distribution expenses: our distribution expenses reduced from 6.5% to 5.3%. We had an increase in warehouse cost, principally due to the changeover in warehouses. We have re-let probably about 60% plus of the previous warehouse. We are busy with the bulk and are re-letting the remainder of the warehouse that we were in. We are operating fully from a new warehouse in Pomona, and we've also moved our offices to 550 Monica. So, we have gone through that, and there were periods and times, obviously, when we had double rents. And so, we think therefore, this will stabilize a little bit going forward. Freight-out: we did manage to achieve some significant savings, and freight-out was down from 5.7 to 4.2, which we think is a good performance on that side. With regard to selling and marketing expenses: selling expenses in total down was slightly down to 15.8 from 16.1. On the year-to-date they were slightly up to 15.6 to 16. Included in selling expenses are commissions that we pay to AB, which has continued to increase as more businesses is transitioning over into the AB system and commissions have increased from 0.9% to 1.5% in the quarter. But, overall, resulting in higher sales expenses, where, if you take sales and marketing together, we did have a decrease.  I am just trying to get through sponsorships, and some of the items that we have hired in last year. Sponsorships were up from 1.3% to 2.5%. That's one of the largest items. We are obviously finding that it's costing more to do business in the category as the competition heats up and there are competitive brands which are obviously competing for the talents of athletes and events. And we are also obviously stepping up our program. We still believe we shouldn't be looking at direct advertising at this point, traditional advertising. So we are putting more money and effort into the alternative sports events, that we've traditionally done, and we want to continue to focus on as we go forward. As a percentage, we did achieve some savings in merchandise displays. It's not as though we've sort of let up it all, but we have in fact been more efficient. We've also obtained contributions from our distributors to the cost of merchandise displays. We feel that in overall execution, the field has in fact improved and we've got more merchandize displays as a percentage up in the stores although our cost of athlete funding, those displays going out has reduced. So those were probably the major items. One other item that I would probably refer to is our sampling costs which have gone up from 0.6% to 1.1% and on a nine-month basis from 0.6% to 0.9%. We really have spent a lot more time getting into sampling, and programs at colleges and events and we feel that's very important for the brand. Just going back to the selling expenses item, the figures I gave you, I think those expenses included distribution. I'm sorry. And that's why, I sort of hesitated for a while and then I looked at them and I saw them a little differently. Selling expenses, in fact, went up to 10.4% from 9.6% in the three months and to 10.4% from 8.9% in the nine months.  On the payroll and administrative side, stock based compensation was $2.1 million, 0.88%, which was down from 1.6 in the previous comparable quarter, while actual administrative salaries was down from 4.5 to 4.1. Legal costs are still obviously being incurred by us at a high rate as we continue to deal with some of the litigation that is starting to taper off now. As I think all of you are aware, the Securities Litigation matter was dismissed with prejudice and against the plaintiffs. So, we think that the others will eventually follow in the same direction. On a segment basis, net sales for the DSD division was $221.888 million up from $152.879 million at the same period last year. Contribution margin was up at $82.328 million from $49.522 million. The warehouse division, net sales were at $25.323 million as compared to $25.787 million, and contribution margin was a little down at $1.242 million versus $1.572 million in the previous period. On a year-to-date basis, DSD net sales were $585.611 million versus $383.745 million. It’s an increase of 52.6% and contribution margin was up to $204.645 million from $140.456 million, up at 45.47%. The percentages on the quarter basis, was 45% up in DSD segment for the quarter and contribution margins was up 66.2%.  In the warehouse for the nine months, net sales were $72.216 million versus $76.85 million and contribution margin was $2.929 million versus $5.069 million. So, sales were up slightly but, contribution margin due to increased costs and increased promotional costs were down. Case sales, 192-ounce case equivalents: in the three months case sales were up at 26.5 million cases, an increase of 5.3 million cases or 24.9% versus 21.2 million cases in the three months, ended September 30, 2006. Overall average net sales price per case increased to 935 in the three months, which is 10.9% higher than the average net sales price of 8.44 for the three months ended September 30, 2006. The increase in average net sales price per case was attributable to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from higher priced products. On a year-to-date basis, case sales were $72.8 million for the nine months, an increase of $17.5 million or 31.7% over $55.3 million for the comparable period last year. Overall average net sales price per case increased to $9.04, which is 10% higher than the average net sales price of $8.22 for the nine months ended September 30, 2006. On a sales regional basis in California, sales of the company decreased from 32% in the quarter to 28.8% in California, comparably outside increased from 68 to 71.2 on a year-to-date basis. Sales in California decreased from 32.4 to 28.8 and comparable outside figures are 71.2 to 67.6. Customer mix in the three months, sales through grocery, specialty chains, and wholesalers decreased from 10% to 8%. Club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers increased from 14% to 16%. Full service distributors increased from 70% to 72%, health food distributors was level about 2% and others was a decrease from 4% to 2%. In the nine months the figures are, retailing decrease from 12% to 9%; Club stores and mass increased from 13% to 15%; full service was the same 70% to 72%; health food 2% on 2% and other 3 down to 2% in mix. Dealing with the balance sheet: cash and short-term investments increased at September to $255 million from a $198 million in June, and from a $137 million in December. This increase was probably due to operations, partially from the exercise of options. Cash is generally invested in high-grade securities with less than one year's duration. And in the three months ended September we've been earning approximately about a 6% yield.  Accounts receivable were at $90 million as of September 30, down from a $111.9 million in June but up from $54.6 in December. Sales were lower going into September than sales in June; obviously, you're going to up your trend in summer. And the same comparison applies to December/September: sales were higher than in September and going into December, at the end of the year, we believe we'll obviously also be able to get accounts receivable down. Sales goes outstanding with 31.2 as of September 30, down from 33.9 in June and 27.1 in December, largely affected by lower days outstanding from the Cadbury Schweppes Group. Cadbury was 32.1 days outstanding as of September, which is one of our large customers. They were at 41.1 in June and 30 in December. The days outstanding also reflect increased sales to distributors that have longer payment terms than other customer groups who take the benefit of a 2% 10 day discount that we extend to those groups. On the inventory side, inventory balances were $94 million as of September versus $87.5 million at June, and $77 million at December. Average days of inventory were 71.2 versus 67.9 in June and 97.7 at the end of December. On the intangible side: trademarks were flat compared to June, marginally up at 23.9 versus 23.6 and up from 21.2 as of December. Current liabilities were 97.8 versus a 114 in June and 62.8 in December. Deferred revenue increased from $20.4 million at December to $40.2 million, due to receipts from AB Distributors which more than compensates the company for the distribution termination payments that we've been paying or having to pay to existing distributors, because the non-matching issue that shows up on our balance sheet as deferred revenue item will be taken to revenue over 20 years. Working capital has increased from $212 million to $363 million. This should give everyone a reason; a good explanation on the balance sheet items. Going forward for October, company's gross sales are up 48% for the month of October and about 43% on a year-to-date basis through the end of October. Year-to-date Monster sales was up about 44.5%. We are happy with the sales increase; we'll talk about the category. We think the brand is still continuing to pull strongly. It's pulling ahead of the category and we'll deal with some of the operational issues we've had in introducing Java and how we plan to address them going forward. According to Nielson, all outlets combined which are convenience and gas, grocery and drug. But it excludes Wal-Mart's and independent markets. The energy category grew in the 13 weeks to the 29th of September grew 33.2% versus a year ago. The Red Bull increased share, we've introduced a 12 ounce bottle, and their share was up for their total brand at 36.4% over a year ago, and their share is 36.2. So, they have changed year-on-year, and is 0.9%. Monster's increased share, according to Nielson, was 51.4% and our percentage dollar share was 24.9, which is also up 3 points on the year ago numbers. Rockstar's percentage change a year ago is 38.5, and their share is 11.8% and their change in points is 0.4. Full Throttle has a 29.7 increase from last year despite a number of new brand extensions, and has a 6.4% share, and so their change on share is down 0.2 from last year. AMP, which is Pepsi, is up 38.4% change. The share is 5.1 and they are 0.2 up from last year with the AMP brand, which they have extended into 160- and 24-ounce and they’ve also had a flavor extension. So, Be No Fear, which is Pepsi, is down 32.8, their share is 3% and the share is down 2.9 points. Adrenaline Rush , which is also So Be from Pepsi, share from last year is up 4.6%. Dollar share is 2.2 of the category, but down 0.6 in the category. I need to just check that figure as we go. There may have been an error in that. No, that is correct. And Lost, share is down 26.9%, they have a 0.5 share and they are down 0.4. So, we’ll see a slight decrease in the percentage changes. But in the convenience channel, which is a major channel, the category is up 35%, and in that channel, which we regard as the major channel, Monster is up 50% and Red Bull is up 40, Rockstar is up 37.9’ Full Throttle up 35 and 34.7, No Fear is negative, Adrenaline is up marginally at 8.3, and Lost is down 25. Talking about Monster; we've increased on the top brand, we've increased our percentage of store selling by 16%. Our sales per point are up 23.7%. And we see the actual brand still being extremely healthy in the category. One of the factors that we look at, which may not be completely scientific, but it’s something that we’ll share with you. When we look at the brands, all of the major brands have been introducing line extensions, package extensions, size extensions over the past year. So when we look at increased share of the brand, we think it also is useful to look at the actual increased share of the individual products. And if you take what we would call: “the main” or “the flagship product” and size package in each of the brands and look at their growth, that often tells a slightly different story. In the case of Red Bull, 8.3 AMP, they did introduce a 12-ounce pack, which cannibalized their other packs, so they are down 23.4% [in convenience in] their lead item, which is their 8.3 regular product. Our regular product, which is Monster 16-ounce green, is up 29.5%. Rockstar's main product: the black regular energy drink, in the black can, is down 0.6%, Full Throttle’s main product is down 11.5%, AMP is up, but also it was going through a conversion to 16 at the time, but their 16 is up 16.7. No Fear is down 26, Adrenaline is down 70, and Lost is down 38. So when you look at it in that light, we believe that Monster's performance was probably unbelievable. The green product was the strongest product in the category by far on year-over-year comparison, on an individual SKU basis. And as we indicated earlier in convenience, the actual product as a brand is still up at 50%, which is very strong.  Just on some market strategy, just to take you through sort of analysis over the past four quarters, we measure convenience and gas at the end of each quarter. That's usually a four- or five-week period because of the year events. So, if we take the years that actually ended up in a five week periods, Monster's market share in convenience and gas as at the end of the December ’06 was 22.1%. That increased to 22.5 at the end of March, increased to 24 at the end of June, and is at 26.8 at the end of September. Red Bull was at 35.3 at the end of December, went up to 36.4 at the end of March, dropped to 35 end of June and is dropped to 34.9 at the end of September. Rockstar was 12.3 at the end of December, dropped to 11.6 end of March’, up to 11.8 in June and is down to 11.3 at the end of September. Full Throttle was 7% at the end of December, is down to 6.7 on each of the three periods following still down at that 6.7. Amp was at 5.4, they increased to 6% at the end of March and have since dropped off to 5.7% share at the end of the June and is down to 5% share at the end of September. No Fear was a 4.8, down to 4.1 end of March, down to 3.4 at end of June, and down to 2.9 at the end of September. And Adrenaline was at 3.3 at the end of December, was down to 3 at the end of March, to down 2.6 at the end of June and down to 2.2 at the end of September. Monster is the number one product in 9 out of the top 30 convenience store, convenience and gas store markets in the U.S. according to Nielsen numbers for the 13 weeks ended September 29. As I’ve indicated previously, by and large the transition arrangements to the AB system is largely complete. We did put a brake on them. We are looking to as to what we should be doing going forward. There will be some selected markets, where I believe we will continue to transition additional markets to the AB system, but that will be done on a carefully selected and determined basis. We think that if you can see from the distribution numbers that we have increased our distribution pretty significantly. Overall, we've increased our regular Monster as a brand by about 16%, which we think is pretty good and the quality of distribution has also increased pretty dramatically. In the case of a lot of our other products, we're also up equivalent amount. So, we think that is largely due to the transition into the AB system. One thing one needs bear in mind is that the Nielsen numbers measure, basically, the chain business whether it's convenience and gas or grocery. It doesn't really deal with the “up and down the street” and the independents, where some of the business is done. And it doesn't measure it, and that is probably the one area where the Budweiser system is not as perhaps as strong as perhaps the independent beverage systems like Coke and Pepsi, because that's parts of their everyday businesses, going to all these non-alcoholic, small mom’s and pop’s stores which are traditionally not on the radar of the beer distributors.  In all cases, they have agreed to address the smaller nonalcoholic areas or the dry areas where there isn't a complete match up of some of the accounts. But there is a greatly challenging part of matching our distribution needs with the traditional AB system. We think that it’s continuing to improve, but that is an area that obviously we have to address with AB system. Shouldn't AB distributors have embraced the brand and the potential for the brand in these, sort of, non-alcoholic accounts more readily with more resources than others? And that is just an ongoing challenge that we've had in the transition to AB. But we all are continuing to make progress there, and, by and large, we are certainly happy. If somebody asked me: looking back would we be happy? Would we’ve done the AB transition again? Yes. We would have, absolutely! We think that was the right decision for the company, the right decision for the brand. It's just a question of working through AB, our good partners, and as I said, it’s a question of working through these issues. And, as we go forward, we’re still growing at better rates than all of our major competitors. With regard to: on premise, that is the one area that is probably coming along more slowly than we had hoped for. It's a slow go. It’s a lot of hard work, a lot of hard lifting. We’re making progress. We are seeing increased sales rates on a monthly basis into the on premise. We are making presentations. It's probably too premature to give you some [again, I think we are having] some success in some very high profile accounts, which we are getting distribution into and some of that distribution will be starting in the fourth quarter and beginning in the new year when contracts come up for renewal. A lot of that business is done on contracts, and, although we’ve approvals, obviously, we can't get going until the existing contracts expire. So, again, on the on premise, I think some of the [funds] and analysts may have possibly expected a quicker sales ramp-up. It is taking time. It's a business that Red Bull has built up over the last 10 years plus and secured a [brilliant great] position and we are obviously working diligently to break into it. And Red Bull knows that we're doing that and they're, obviously, also working diligently to keep us out of it. So there is a heavy lifting, but we are very confident that we are going to make a success. We are going to get it going; we are working through some issues in sort of integrating the sales effort into the AB sales team. There are some challenges there because they've got their focus on their own products as well and so we're looking through the various issues. But, once again, it is taking some time and that's one of things that have, perhaps, not come on board as quickly as we had originally hoped. On the Java Monster side, the brand is doing extremely well. It's been very successful, it’s successful pretty much, we've hampered by achieving sufficient production. We are getting more production, it's started up. We ramped up production in October and November.  Our plans for the product line are very exciting. We've been getting very good response from the retail chains. They've seen the sales number. We've seen the sales numbers falling to come through in the Nielsen number for convenience and gas, but we, ruefully, got no grocery or other [travel mass] business yet. And in those cases, Java Monster is selling at sales per point that is comparable to Chaos and [MIT] and Assault. So we're very excited that we are getting nice sales per point sell through on Java. The challenge, again, has been in launching the product before we've had the schematics in the convenience stores changed. We are getting the schematics change. We are in the schematics coming -- starting the New Year where we are in the right shelf, we are in the coffee door. And we are planning to introduce a number of additional SKU's in that line. We think we see that line as a very different line. It's sort of a cousin; it’s a subline of Monster, but it is different, and in order to maximize our opportunity there, we are going to introduce quite a number of additional SKU's in Java Monster. We’re in fact introducing a low-cal version, a hazelnut flavor version called [Nut Up]. We are introducing a product called: the Russian which is a Kahlua-flavored coffee energy drink and one called: Irish Blend, which is sort of an Irish-whiskey-flavored coffee blend. They're all nonalcoholic. But that gives us that we're also introducing a Chai Hai product. The local product obviously it can't get it to the same low calories that you would normally get a diet drink to, but it is about half the calories of our regular drink. So those are going to come out, pretty much, towards the end of the year. We think that’s going to really [start to promote] at least probably a full shelf in the major convenience and gas chain accounts. And once we have that real estate put in place, and locked in with programs for 2008, we think that the cannibalization that we had experienced, and the trial going over from Monster consumer, will be minimized and we'll be able to draw and compete head-on. Obviously, more directly with the Starbucks’ coffee range, and the new coffee range, that Coke is introducing under the Caribou name. This will minimize cannibalization from us, but also draw equally from almost all energy consumers to the extent they do have conversion at the moment. With lots of these retailers having put Java Monster directly into the Monster space, obviously, the principal brand that's suffering the canalization is Monster itself and it’s also to be naturally expected. At the end of the day you have traditional monster consumers. They're coming to the store; they're seeing another product named Java Monster. You are more likely to get them sign the brand and then doing some cross-switching. But again, after trial, that will settle down. One of the reasons we think that we can take a price increase is we have to sales. We do think there should be a clear distinction in price between Java Monster, which is more closely priced to the high price coffee drinks that Starbucks has. On an ounce for ounce basis, we have more value and so we believe that we will be able to sustain the higher prices. We're going to use a higher price across the whole Java Monster line going forward. We are still in the process of working through the price increases on the 16-ounce Monster line. We are going ahead with some price increases, but we have some other things in the works, and we're just sort of trying to decide finally what would be the optimal time and basis of doing so going forward. We're also going to introduce an additional juice product in the Monster line, which is a juice product called Mixed, and we're also about to introduce a 52-ounce can sized Monster to complement the BFC Monster under the brand name called Heavy Metal in a 32-ounce can. Ultimately, we haven’t made a decision yet but, the plan may be to take that into and we shall see how the reception is, and also take it into a 16-ounce extension probably in the second quarter of next year. So we do have some brand line extensions. We're also going, as I indicated earlier, to extend the Rumba with an additional juice product in addition to the Lost. So we have a number of new products going out. We will get additional shelf space. We're busy at the current time in negotiations with major retail chains to secure shelf space for 2008, and we think that that will also be important in enabling us to continue to see incremental growth in the overall Monster brand. On the international side, sales in Canada were consistent. They are all continuing to grow. We've overcome a number of obstacles in working with the Pepsi group. We think that things are working more smoothly now and we're seeing some solid increases and we're very happy they are increasing the number of Monster SKU’s that they will be distributing to Canada, so that is positive. We're also continuing to make progress in the Mexican market. We're going to introduce an additional SKU there. And that is continuing to grow and we're very happy there. With regard to expansion into Europe: we have taken the decision to expand into Europe. We've made the decision to expand into the United Kingdom as the first country that we're looking to. We've appointed a Senior Marketing Executive from Red Bull, Mr. Guy Carling, who was with Red Bull in the U.K. to head our U.K. operations and ultimately going into Europe. We also are starting to start up those operations. Due to the unusual distribution systems in the U.K., we've certain specialty distributors who go, for example, to the what we call: “convenience and gas”. They call it: “the garage forecourts” or the “on premise”. In order to avoid an extra tier of distributor, in some cases, we will be dealing direct with retail chains. For example: grocery, at this point in time, it is our plan to go direct to the grocery chains. To get to the forecourts, we will deal directly with the specialty distributor that goes in there. We'll appoint a specialty distributors for on premise and we have appointed an on premise person to head up the on premise in the U.K., who is an ex-employee of Red Bull, who has left them some months ago, but he is very well known and is very experienced in the on premise business in the U.K. As soon as we get the U.K. settled down, we are going to look abroad. We are going through and we're evaluating packing opportunities in Europe now. We may initially start -off by shipping product from the U.S. in the five normal cans, but ultimately, obviously, we will be packing in the U.K. and/or in Europe as we go forward. So the plan is pretty much starting to get exposure, starting to make some marketing plans there and to kickoff in the U.K. early in the New Year. Sales in September were somewhat weak and until that time the sales had been going pretty well. I can't explain why they were weak in September. The increase was weak in the last couple of weeks of September (Technical Difficulty).
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And we'll take our first question from Andrew Sawyer of Goldman Sachs.
Andrew Sawyer - Goldman Sachs: Hello guys. I was wondering: if you could talk about this volatility? I guess, we're seeing in your selling with second quarter up 57%, the third quarter up 38%, and now October up, I think you said, 48%. Has there been a real slowdown in sell- through? Or is there something in the ordering pattern which could explain that? Or how do you think we should think about that?
Rodney Sacks: I just don't know. I don't have an exact answer for you on that. I saw that we had a slight reduction in sales in September, which I just don't have an explanation for why that happened. It picked up again. I was looking at the AB numbers and the same thing. The AB numbers had been growing from AB distributors, as we were transitioning for each month, we increased in June, July. We were up on May, June, July, and August. And then just a drop off in September and we were back up in October. Pretty much very close to the August number again. Obviously, October is traditionally a weaker month, but we will be pretty close back to that number on the AB distributors. And so, I'm looking at the category generally and I just don't have an explanation of what happened towards the end of September. I just can't throw more light on it. When I look at the actual Nielson numbers, which may just change, we're up very nicely in that. I mean we're up 51%, on the 13-week basis.
Andrew Sawyer - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then, I guess, kind of shifting gears and you talked about cannibalization rates for Java Monster, any way: can you put some sort of quantification around what impact you think that had and quantify, perhaps, how incremental shelf space you getting as part of these resets?
Rodney Sacks: In many cases, we did achieve a full shelf for Java Monster in the separate door and pretty much we’re getting between two, three and in some cases up to four shelves for monster now. So we are actually getting incremental. In many cases, it's another full shelf.
Andrew Sawyer - Goldman Sachs: And then, just one last quick one, you talked about taking the Java Monster price increase: can you tell us how much that is? And then: can you update us on whether you’re thinking of taking a broad 16-ounce price increase, especially Red Bull talking about 16-ounce product?
Rodney Sacks: I think, on the Java Monster side, it's probably going to be in the order of about $3 a case, but I can't be more specific. We haven't finalized the amount.
Andrew Sawyer - Goldman Sachs: That's about 10%, I guess?
Rodney Sacks: Yes. And Monster, we haven’t yet decided, because we have some other things in the works that are just too premature for me too discussed at this point on the cans. So we are looking at Monster, we’re going up roughly of the order of about probably 6% or 7%. But, we haven't yet finalized when we going to it and exactly what context we're going to do it. So there are some other issues that have arisen that we trying to address before we go out and be seen, what's happening with Red Bull and other competitors, we'll make a decision on that reasonably shortly, but we just haven’t finalized that yet.
Andrew Sawyer - Goldman Sachs: Thanks a lot, guys.
Rodney Sacks: Sure.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Mark Astrachan of Stifel Nicolaus.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Good afternoon, guys. I guess, first of all, just to follow up on Andrew's question: could you talk a little bit about what you saw in terms of your own core energy drink brands versus some of the tertiary brands in the quarter; in terms of what the incremental negative was for the Lost and Chaos and so forth, looking at what the core brands did?
Rodney Sacks: If you look up sales for the all brands, just list of sales for quarter. I'll get to that, Mark, and I'll get back to you. [I’ll just onset] longer we're dealing with it. Just one thing I wanted correct the one figure I've given for promotional allowances reduction from [’06 to ’08 about] 13.5 down 12.4, it is actually 14.5 down to 12.4, and the year-to-date was 15.4 down to 13.8, just wanted to correct that.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. Well, I guess, while you're looking for that. I can give you another question.
Rodney Sacks: Okay. I've got it over here: The effect of the drop off in sales of what I would call these Allied products was in the quarter about $5.5 million to $6 million with energy. So about $6 million was the dropped off in the other energy products, based on the pervious year, whereas, obviously, we had expected an increase. So it, obviously, has affected the numbers quite dramatically.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: $6 million for the previous year?
Rodney Sacks: Yeah, in the quarter. These Allied product sales were lower. So if we had been projecting a 40% increase or 50% on the Allied products, so if you’ve got it in numbers that would have made about a $10 million difference.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Right. Okay.
Rodney Sacks: Okay. And then, one of the major other items was in our DSD division we lost about $3 million in the quarter on teas, lemonades, and cocktails that was down, which was sale for one customer where their sales were down, we were doing sort of a special brand for them. A control brand and their sales were quite substantial as you can see from those numbers. I think the reason was probably it introduced [off and] there was sell-in. And that accounted for $3 million also negative on the warehouse division.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. Great. And then, in terms of thinking about your selling and promotion activity on a forward-looking basis: Yeah, obviously, Pepsi has talked about making more of an effort to get into the energy drink arena through various sponsorships and product promotions and things like that. So, I guess, tell me: what you’re seeing their in terms of preliminary trends for '08 in terms of what the potential cost increase in this category? And then, building on that, you're talking about getting these incremental placements in coolers and shelves and having Java Monster separate from your Monster brand. What is that going to cost you as well in terms of how do you think of that?
Rodney Sacks: As I indicated earlier, we've actually achieved a reduction in our allowances, which is really the area you were addressing there. That’s the MDF and chain CMAs et cetera that we put in slotting. We believe that, going forward, we will at least be as efficient as we have or possibly be able to get some reduction even going forward even though we will be listing it for the first time a lot of the, obviously, the Java Monster into the chains. But going through the year, it may get a little bit skewed in the beginning. But if you take it over the whole of the next year, we believe we probably will be very close to, or better than, the lower numbers that we've shown in this quarter. With regard to the marketing costs: we have stepped up our marketing. We believe: “yes, there will be additional marketing”. Pepsi has publicly committed to going into spending additional money. They've spent a very substantial amount to get into NASCAR. We're not sure that that's going to help the brand very much. We're not sure it's the right consumer, and we don't believe that’s going to change the fortunes of Amp. We’ve seen Amp that has -- it had tremendous amount of attention given to it and a substantial amount of SKU and package expansion into 16- and 24-ounce and yet when you look at the numbers as I read them out earlier, it's really made no difference. In fact, they're lower than they were six to nine months ago. So, we don't believe, as a market share -- so we don’t believe that Amp will in fact have the legs to ultimately increase any market share of any significance that's going to affect our market share. They other brands in the Pepsi camp don’t have the legs that are falling off quite substantially. We have a similar view to Full Throttle. We don't believe that that has the legs. There has been a tremendous amount of effort put behind Full Throttle going forward. They have had three to four. There were now a total, I think, of four different SKUs in regular and low carb. They have got diet. They have got 24-ounce. They’ve used a new one called Mother or something of that order recently. And again, if you look at their share, they've also come off. They’ve not been able to go on [share] even though they're at an awful lower base. Now, they are already spending and promoting very aggressively across that brand and so we do believe we'll be able to handle it. We believe that we're going to continue to do what we're doing. We think we do that well. That really translates and identifies who we are as a brand. We think we need to stay true to the personality of the brand. And that sort of our strategy at the moment is to continue to go along those lines and not be distracted by the fact that there are these enormous spends that might be coming from one or other competitor into other areas.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Great. And then final question: could you tell us what your trends look like from fourth quarter of last year, on a month by month basis, in terms of what you are lapping in October and what are going to be lapping in November and December, your volume increases?
Rodney Sacks: Yeah. I'll just try and find out while we are here; I will try to find out individual monthlies. I don't have them easily to hand. But we'll try and find them while we're looking, and I'll come back to that question.
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Thank you, guys.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Greg Badishkanian of Citi.
Greg Badishkanian - Citi: Hi. Just a few questions here: First one on Java: You’d mentioned that it’s about 10% of, I think, Monster sales. And what percent do you think that could get up to over the next 12 months?
Rodney Sacks: You know, Greg, we really don't know. We think that the category will expand. We are having competition. One of our competitors, Rockstar has just copied us as they’ve done in the past as well. They've introduced a Rockstar Roasted. We think that just a not a really well thought through attempt to just compete with whatever we do. But we think that that whole category will broaden into that coffee area, really that's what's going to happen. We think that that category will expand and expand consumer usage and then consumer demographic into the category. So, we think that it will, ultimately, with the extra expansion, we're coming and offering a low carb version, offering these other versions offering a chai version. We believe that will increase the category and the consumer base and percentage. But we think it will go into the double digits. It will be in the teens somewhere. Overall, it might get to the high teens of the overall sales. But, hopefully, we won't cannibalize the existing products to the extent that we probably have in the past three to four months. But we think that, ultimately, we are probably hoping to be something close to 20% of our business. The real benefit is that these products offer a morning alternative to traditional coffee to the existing cold coffee drinks. But with the energy kick to it we think that we will actually also draw on the hot coffee sector -- from the hot coffee sector. Additionally, we just believe that the whole product lineup has been very well received and will continue to grow.
Greg Badishkanian - Citi: And what percentage of Java right now is sold next to energy as you sort of look at the retail? And where do you think that ultimately will be? Do you think it's going to be a vast majority sort of in that emerging category?
Rodney Sacks: We think we will get the vast, going forward, we believe we’ll get the vast majority into the right door. In many accounts that door is right next to it or maybe above it or below it. And sometimes in very small stores there may only be one or two doors. But those are the minority. The majority do have a separate door and separate either next to it or may be two or three away. We believe that the vast majority of our sets going forward will end up in the right door. Whereas, at the moment, we're seeing probably the vast majority in the energy set because that's been the easy way to selling three SKUs. While having a whole offering of eight SKUs to nine SKUs or, whatever it is, of eight SKUs, seven, eight SKUs, which will take up a full shelf of nine. It won’t be able to be put into the Monster Energy, and that will force it into its own space. Particularly, with extra SKUs coming on the Monster side on the juice and heavy metal, we believe we will be able to tighten up, get extra space, but tighten it and that will force retailers to actually take the trouble and effort to go and reset their shelves. So, that they actually put the product in the right section instead of taking the lazy, easy way out which is what's happened to us in the past three to four months. And I think they also believe us now. I think everybody weren’t sure whether Monster Java would be a credible competitor to Starbucks, because literally nothing else has been able to stand up to Starbucks over the past number of years. And I think everybody in the retail side have been converted and they already do believe and see that this brand in the coffee format has serious legs, good sell-through and clearly they're now all prepared to make space in order to maximize their own profitability in their stores.
Greg Badishkanian - Citi: Do you know what their margin is on yours versus Starbucks?
Rodney Sacks: I don't know that figure off hand. I don’t know. But they are getting very healthy margins on our product. They're getting pretty much their full margins.
Greg Badishkanian - Citi: Okay. And so higher than the Starbucks you think maybe?
Rodney Sacks: I just don't know the Starbucks. I know that they have full modules. I don't know what Starbucks has been able to achieve with them generally.
Greg Badishkanian - Citi: Yeah.
Rodney Sacks: I just don't have that information.
Greg Badishkanian - Citi: All right. Absolutely. And do you have any early read on the Red Bull 16-ounce can? I think it is 3.49 to 3.60 price point that's being sold at the market?
Rodney Sacks: I don't think they're achieving that. I think it’s coming into the market at 3.79.
Greg Badishkanian - Citi: It is. Okay.
Rodney Sacks: Yeah. And which is way above our 24-ounce pricing. So we think that that's not going to be a big issue. Again, we think what's happened is, if you look at the Red Bull numbers, they have kept up with the category, so they have stopped the erosion in the percentage share. But when you look at the actual product mix, they’ve really transferred product sales from their 8-ounce to their 16 to their 12 in order to keep up their market share. And when you look at that, overall, I think that the 16-ounce is probably only going to cannibalize more than the 12. But the result is I think that they’re going to find that 8-ounce is probably going to become the smaller packet. And it is almost going to go away. And I think they going to [talk forth], they carry on and introduce 16 permanently, they will probably find is our guess that they will end up with 12 and 16 and eight will go away, which hurts them on their own margin. But they've obviously been trying to fight continuing loss in market share over the past of couple years and this is what they are trying. But I think that 16 is not going to help them other than reduce their own margins and costs. Just going into the numbers on the sales from one of the earlier questions, this October versus last year, I'm looking for this October. Last year October was marginally ahead of September. And then it dropped off on a gross basis to about 44 from about 52 dropped off to 44 in November and about 38, nearly 39 in December whereas on the numbers that we have, we've basically gone up from September to October. Our October number is about 10%, 11% higher than September. So, just to give you some idea.
Greg Badishkanian - Citi: Great. Thanks.
Rodney Sacks: All right. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Steve Colbert of Canaccord Adams.
Steve Colbert - Canaccord Adams: Hi, guys. Good afternoon.
Rodney Sacks: Good afternoon. Hi.
Steve Colbert - Canaccord Adams: Looking at sales for the quarter, how should we look at the sequential drop off in growth? I know you just touched on it a little, but September was soft. Can you quantify how soft it was year-over-year versus what you saw in July, I guess?
Rodney Sacks: September, I don't have it for the whole company for the month. I don’t have it. I have it percentage wise versus the year before. I know that in September, Monster was about -- July -- August was off about 3% from -- the increase was about 3% lower in August than July and then in September was about 4% lower than in August on a prior year basis.
Steve Colbert - Canaccord Adams: Okay.
Rodney Sacks: And then what has happened is, then in October, it's come back about 10% higher.
Steve Colbert - Canaccord Adams: And I know you touched on it, but you really can't kind of pin anything on what's driving the re-acceleration?
Rodney Sacks: No. I think a lot of it may just have been timing. I don't know whether it was orders coming in for Labor Day, that they pulled back orders and then put the orders in after deliveries. I know we did struggle with some deliveries. We couldn’t get out. We had more orders for Java Monster than we could deliver. That was a material number that we had to reverse out. There was a little bit of a couple of other products deliveries we just didn't get out at the end of the month. So we probably had a slightly higher. When we book our sales, we close over month end and then we actually go back in and check the deliveries to see, to verify which products were actually delivered to customers before we book them. And so normally we end up for the month and then you end up with a reversal depending on how much of the products that have shipped had actually been received. And I know that in September it was just higher than usual. But again, that was a smaller portion. The main portion was, in fact, I believe the Java Monster that we just weren’t able to get out at the end. There were a couple of manufacturing issues. We shipped the [light] things a few days and in any case we just couldn’t keep up with the orders. So, we ended up with quite a bit of a reversal there. And I just don't have another explanation because I just don't have one. I mean, I haven't been able to get to something that I have been able to put my finger on and say that it is.
Steve Colbert - Canaccord Adams: Okay. Fair enough. Obviously, the Nielsen numbers, everything still looks pretty strong. How do you view the consumer environment? How discretionary do you think energy drinks are?
Rodney Sacks: We think that they are. We think they're just becoming more and more acceptable. They are becoming the soft drink of the future. We think that they're performing. We think that consumers are drinking the products regularly as part of their regular beverage selection now. It's not as though it’s a treat selection or they I'll do it once or they are going to go out and party and do it with something. We believe that this is from our read into the markets and the feedback people are just regular consumers. The same as if you have a regular coffee consumer. They drink one cup of coffee every morning. People are drinking one cup of Monster in the morning or they are drinking one can in the afternoon. It's just becoming a regular part of their traditional beverage selection, their regular diet. So we see that the category continuing to solidify, continuing to strengthen. That the use occasions continuing to segment out. And there will be use occasions for the morning, for lunchtime, for the evening, for mixing. We just continue to see that. We really do see it continuing to grow. We do see, obviously, a slight deceleration in percentage wise when you look at the dollar numbers. They're continuing to be very, very strong. I mean this whole sector is continuing to grow enormously in dollars now. It’s becoming a real big sector. When you look at all the other new age sectors, this sector is starting to completely outgrow that.
Steve Colbert - Canaccord Adams: Okay. Fair enough. And then if you can just talk a bit more about the opportunity in England? How big do you think the market is over there? What's the rollout going to look like?
Rodney Sacks: We think that the market is a big market. We think that traditionally the market is the biggest, what I'd call real energy product is Red Bull. A very heavy product there that had for many years, that was traditionally not an energy drink, but it was pretty much a glucose based drink called Lucozade and it was used as a, sort of mix it and dilute. It’s a ready-to-drink [cold]. They’ve put an enormous amount. It is Glaxo SmithKline who owned it. They’ve put a tremendous amount of effort behind the brand. It sold primarily in glass bottles or plastic. They positioned it as just a sort of a sports pick-me-up. And it’s slightly different positioning, but they have a lot of business. So if you look at the whole category, we believe the category is probably of the order of about £400 million to £500 million. That’s probably between $800 million -- or $750 million to $1 billion at retail. And so we think it's a big category. For a country of 50 million people, that's a pretty high per capita consumption. And what we see is that that is a great market. It's really been unchallenged. The competitors that were there haven't made inroads. And we just see that there is a great opportunity. And once we obviously establish ourselves, they will go into other markets. We see Germany particularly as a high consumption market. There are a little bit of some lower priced brands, local brands that have done quite well there. So the pricing in some cases, there is a price stratification in Germany between Red Bull and the local brands. But there are also some strong markets elsewhere in Europe. And the whole European market is pretty much, as big as the American market. So, we see a lot of growth opportunity, but, again, it will take time and effort to get there and to do it right. But we obviously are determined to do that. And we see that as a main focus for the next couple of years for us.
Steve Colbert - Canaccord Adams: Okay. And then final question for me: Looking at the cash balance you built up, what's the current repurchase authorization? And then: are there any plans to be active in it?
Rodney Sacks: On the share repurchase, again, we do have an intention to look at that. We basically do have an existing plan in place. We are going to evaluate an increase in that plan. And to go ahead, obviously, there was quite a substantial run up in the share price over the past couple of months. We will look at the repurchase program based in the light of current share prices from time to time. And our belief is that, again, we need to get a Board consensus on it because we're having a Board meeting late this week. But certainly from our point of view at management, we believe that we should go ahead and instigate a share repurchase program. But that will be subject to the formal approval of the Board, which we’ll need to go though with them. And then, obviously if that is so, we will announce it.
Steve Colbert - Canaccord Adams: Okay. Great. That's it for me. Thanks, guys.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll be taking our final question of today from Alton Stump of Longbow Research
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Thank you. Hello, Rodney.
Rodney Sacks: Hi. Hi, Alton.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Just had a quick question, not to get too specific, but on the cost front, you mentioned early on that there was some increased shelf space programs as well as invasion fees. Could you try to ballpark that number for me? What impact it was year-over-year and in the third quarter?
Rodney Sacks: The Invasion fees that we paid in the quarter were about $3.8 million versus $1.3 million in the prior period.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Great. Thank you. And then, on the shelf space program: any idea there?
Rodney Sacks: That was up from about five to just over eight in the quarter.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: That's great. Thank you. And then, just one other question: We've seen for the last couple of quarters in a row, superior growth in the category within the convenience and gas channel versus grocery. Obviously, the CG channel should be more saturated, but still it is doing better. Any thoughts there? It is just better focus from all the major players involved do you think that's driving that?
Rodney Sacks:  You say you’ve seen more growth in the convenience?
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Right so.
Rodney Sacks: Yeah. There is. It’s just a question of, I think, that the grocery chains are just haven’t yet really completely embraced the energy category as a substantial incremental value to them whereas I believe the convenience and gas have in fact done so. And I believe that the grocery chains haven’t allocated the same amount of space proportionally that perhaps they should have done, whereas the convenience, just because they have been in it much longer have done so. And they have seen more profit. So when you look at the grocery increase, grocery is only up 22.5% year-on-year as a category. Although, obviously, we feel we’ve done very well there, because we’ve actually upped 53.7% in grocery, which is quite interesting because you’ve got really good execution coming out of Coke with Full Throttle, they are only up 7.3. That sort of made earlier inroads because it isn’t a channel that they’re more familiar with, but the year-on-year is only up 7.3, and the same thing with Rockstar, that’s up 37. And even the sort of revitalized, call it, Amp is only up 49.6 in that channel, which is the hunting ground for Pepsi. That’s their one of the main channel for sales of beverages. So we’ve actually exceeded the growth in that category. But the category as such still is still very small proportion of convenience. And as you say, the overall growth in convenience is still outstripping them. But I just think it’s a question of embracing it and consumers embracing it. And it will grow. It’s just going to take more time.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Okay. Great. That’s all I have. Thanks, Rodney.
Rodney Sacks: Thank you.
Operator: And Mr. Sacks, I’d like to turn the call back over to you, sir, for any additional or closing remarks.
Rodney Sacks: Okay. Thanks very much. So gentlemen, again, thank you very much. I know there have been a number of issues that we’ve had to deal with and we are trying to deal with in this call and as we go forward in the category, there is some unusual things that have happened. We’re all very excited. We do believe that we’ve got a category that is still growing very much more than any other category particularly with the size of it in the beverage field, because we believe that it will continue to grow. And we believe that the expansion of this category into this coffee area is an extremely exciting number for us. We think that that will help expand the category. We also believe that our juice offerings in the Rumba line will expand the category. So going forward, we are pretty excited for the prospects for the fourth quarter and for next year as a whole for the company. We need to address some other issues. We realize that on-premise to try and see how that grows and see what we can do to speed that up to the extent that we can. We need to minimize cannibalization. We think that will rectify itself when we get more identified shelf space going forward into the New Year. And we also need to address these issues of the Allied Products and we have some plans. We've just introduced a new whole line of products in a slim can, in a 11-ounce, 10.5-ounce slim can which are less than 100 calories. There is a dark line, there's a green tea line in it. We believe that going forward next year, we are already positioned very well in that healthier alternative category as well. I know it's sort of dwarfed at the moment by the Monster product, but in the long term we believe that’s a very solid and viable category. Half the beverage category is still carbonated and we believe we have a very credible [player] that pretty much everybody’s looking for is the solution to get a healthier better position. So, we believe we do have that in that Hansen line. So we are quite excited going forward with our products. We are still very excited about as I’ve said I want to reinforce that the relationship with Anheuser-Busch is a very strong relationship. We are very happy with the relationship. We understand that they are happy with the relationship as well. We just got to deal with operational issues as we go forward because that happens in life and that we'll get through them all. We are going to also take steps to try and address some of, perhaps, the smaller independents and some of the dry area issues that we've encountered in transitioning into AB system and we have some plans in place to try and get to them to also improve our general availability and sales of our products. So overall, we are excited. We do believe it has been a good result. We're getting some of the other issues and stock option issues behind us. Hopefully, that will stop distracting management and we can put our heads down and go forward with the business. So, thank you very much for your support. And we'll report back at the end of the year on the fourth quarter in due course. Thank you.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to today's Hansen Natural Corporation Second Quarter 2007 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Sacks. Please go ahead sir. 
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning ladies and gentlemen, thank you for attending this call. To start, I just would like to report for the record that certain factors made in this call may constitute forward-looking statements in the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 19333 as amended and Section 21E of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended. Regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues and profitability we cautioned that these statements are qualified by the terms or important factors many of which are outside the control of the company that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from the statements herein. Thank you.  We do also wish to report that we assure no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Again, just perhaps run very briefly through the announcements, gross sales for the second quarter increased 54.1% to $280.6 million from $192.1 million a year earlier. Net sales increased 56.9% to $244.8 million from a $156 million a year ago. Operating income for the second quarter increased 34.3% to $61.4 million from $45.8 million a year ago, net income for the second quarter increased 35.9% to $38.3 million or $0.39 per diluted share from $28.2 million or $0.28 per diluted share last year.  Net operating income was after taking into account certain non-recurring expense items which I will describe and after that if you exclude those items, operating income increased by 61.7% to $74 million from $45.8 million a year ago and net income for the same quarter on the same basis increase 62.7% to $45.9 million or $0.47 per diluted share from $28.2 million or $0.28 per diluted share last year. The items concerned are all explained in the announcement. Firstly, in connection with the transition of certain of our distribution arrangements to the Anheuser-Busch system, we incurred termination cost of $8.4 million and $14.7 million during the three and six months periods respectively to certain of our prior distributors. These positive expense is included in operating expenses for the three and six months. These are one of the major cost we referred to is non-recurring for obvious reasons and also for, I want to draw to your attention that we have received income in the form of... principally in the form of cash which is equal to or exceeds the amounts we have expensed but because of accounting rules net income is only being brought to account after 20 years. So, you really do have a mismatching. So, they are non-recurring at the moment in order to believe, show a clear picture of our trading, we think it is appropriate for those items to be excluded and then for the numbers to be looked at and I will give you some of the numbers as we go through on net basis.  In addition the amount... or just what we received from the Anheuser-Busch distributors were non-refundable patents and commitments amounting to $6.5 million and $19.8 million in the three and six months, that aren't always met exactly because you may get the payment and then your termination may take place in a different period.  The revenue recognized on net basis was a $0.5 million in the quarter and $0.9 million in the six months end of June. The other costs that we believe should be excluded in trying to assess and sort of analyze the numbers and that is the cost that we incurred by the company in connection with the review of our stock option grants and granting practices and relates to litigation. Professional service fee was $4.2 million in the quarter and $10.9 million for the six months. These fees have also been expensed in the respective periods and we believe that they are also non-recurring and out of the ordinary quarter therefore should be excluded in order to properly assess and review our results.  If we do that, what you get is the position that your net income as a percentage of sales was 18.1% last year in the quarter and is reflected in the result at 15.7% but if you adjust for these amounts the effect, the net income as a percentage was 18.7% which is just slightly ahead of last year which shows that we are still able to continue to bring some good numbers to the bottom line.  On a six months basis, last year the net income as a percentage was 17.9%, it's reflected in this year's... sorry, in this quarter's financial statements at 14.2%, but if you again use the figures and exclude these figures, these costs, the non-recurring cost the figure comes in at 18% which is just above last year. So we think those are important numbers that should be taken into account.  To run through again just on the six months figures which I haven't given you, gross sales increased 47.1% to $470 million from $320 million a year earlier. Net sales for the first half were up 48.9% to $410 million from $275 million a year ago. Operating income for the six months advanced 15.8% to $93.3 million from $80.6 million a year ago, net income for the first half increased 18.7% to $58.5 million or $0.59 per diluted share from $49.3 million or $0.50 per diluted share last year.  Operating income excluding the non-recurring expense items that I have discussed earlier increased 47.6% to $118.9 million from $18.6 million a year ago, the net income for the first half on the same basis increased 15% to $73.9 million or $0.75 per diluted share from $49.3 million or $0.50 per diluted share last year.  Gross profit as percentage of net sales for the three months ended June increased to 52.4% from 51.9% for the comparable 2006 quarter. This was we think a great achievement. It was largely fuelled by the increase as a percentage of our sales of our DSD product. They went up from roughly about an 85% mix compared to our warehouse products to about a 90% mix. That obviously helped and although we did have items within the DSD section where we had a slight decrease in margin, the juice products 24 ounce and also the addition of Java Monster which is a lower margin product. So those additional products are at lower margins but yet they are still at higher margins than the warehouse division. So when you look, as a result of the mix during the quarter we actually ended up with an ability to actually increase our gross margin.  Going forward it is going to be obviously difficult to continue to increase the percentage of our sales above the 90% level, above the warehouse division, but we think it will happen but its going to be at a more gradual basis. And so we still have the issue that obviously as we continue to expand Java Monster in 24 ounce and they continue to be a greater part of DSD business there will be a slight compression on our margin because of the low margin that those products have. But again at this point they are still the minority of the DSD sales, majority of the DSD sales are Regular Monster, and Lo-Carb Monster in 16 ounce which comprises a bulk of the DSD business and of the Monster business.  Going through a couple of other items that I wanted to take you through. On the balance sheet side, in current assets, let me go through perhaps on cash and cash equivalents. I mean, two short term investments as really one item, increase from $136,796,000 at the end of December '06 to $198,095,000 at the end of June. This obviously we have demanded in investing this cash and we are earning about 5% on it. It is generally invested in high grade securities with less than 1 year's duration.  Accounts receivables increased from $54,624,000 to $111,928,000. The days outstanding on accounts receivable went down from the first quarter from 35.4 to 33.9 but slightly up in the forth quarter which was up on the fourth quarter which is 27.1 days. The increase was largely driven by one of the large customers outstanding the doctor, the kept Rigvets [ph] group which as I'll expand on the number of quarter about how they have to consolidate within the group and it takes time to get the payment in from them. It's just a effect of lock and we try and with them but we did have a shorten period in December and they were out a little in June at they were about 41 days whereas as of December there were at a lower daily level.  In addition with the increase in sale, the percentage of sales, that are represented by DSD products that is all on 30 day terms as opposed to when you give a 2% 10 day term and so the greater mix is through distributors which has resulted also obviously continues to set result in a slot pushing out of all of our receivables. With respect to the increase, one of the comments I just want to make is that net sales in June were very much higher than the net sales in December and for that reason you are also obviously picking up the receivables that come with the increased sales. We are going into a period, I think you must realize going in to December, end of the year, you are probably on a downward trend in your sales because you are higher shelter in the summer months and sort of lowest through the winter, say you sort of sending letters you go into December was when you are going in to June you are selling more, you are accelerating into some of your selling's and despite of all past all that retail going through in the market. And so that was higher.  In the case of inventory, inventory increased from $77 million at the end of December to $87.5 million, so there is a... the launch is pretty nominal increase. Days in inventory actually came down quite substantially from 98 to 68. So, we were actually managing our inventory. One of the reasons as you know we've obviously now explained and discussing in more detail later in the job amongst us. Obviously we had some raw materials here but we have had constraints on our production capacity which difficult strength on sales and basically we were able to manage our inventory a bit better but obviously that's because we shipped, we are shipping out very quickly.  On the asset side, intangible assets increased form $22,600,000 to $24,800,000 largely due to increased legal cost incurred in protecting the Monster market protecting our trademark generally. On the liabilities, accounts payable moved up quite substantially from $34.36 million to $91.8 million. This increase was largely in line with increases in inventories and general operating expenses. Our payables... our cost of goods in June again was very much substantially higher than our cost of goods in December where we were paring back production because of obviously anticipating going into the end of the year and going into January. Whereas in June we are giving up production and we are buying good volume for materials and obviously we are buying products as well, finished products.  So, that really basically accounts for that increase. We are continuing to take advantage of world class discounts that we get often and substantially all of our expenses are being paid within their payment terms. We believe that hello this is a large increase, we believe its perfectly within the normal range of our trading in the way that we are operating the business and going into June. Deferred revenue has increased from $20 million to $39 million that's due to the receipts coming in from the distributors which more than compensate the company only for the distribution termination payments we've paid to the existing distributors, but again because of the non-matching issue that shows up on our balance sheet now as a deferred revenue item that will be taken to the account over 20 years.  Working capital has increased from $212 million to $294 million and I think that all I'd like to say on the balance sheet that should give everyone a reason with good explanation of the balance sheet items. Going forward sales going into July sales are up in July 43.6% in the company. Sales of Monster are up well over 50% one of the issues the sales would have might appear first launched to be a little lower than we have achieved as a increase in sales in the third quarter, that's there are number of reasons for that. It was a short month in deliveries, secondly we had a buy and obviously in we took out our pricing about 24 ounce product and the water buying that's just simply one of the effect of loss and is normal which obviously did boost sales a little bit in June and then it took away from detector from sales in July, we believe that will soon normalize as we go forward.  And then finally we did have some shortages in Monster Java sales of Monster Java which are again the Lutheran [ph] explains will go through this now are doing very nicely but we just weren't able to get out product so some the sales that we had that taken orders had were deferred over into August. We are quite happy with the sales increase. We still think that the brand is continuing to post strongly and is ahead of the category and it really is very exciting that we have been able to maintain this momentum and we continue to do so going forward.  Talk a little bit about the market, market share measuring the markets, basically in our measurement we have increased our market share over last year and it was a slight sort of dip in towards the end of last year when Red Bull introduced a 12 ounce can which obviously gave them a boost as there was a lot of introductory trial, Rockstar over the course of the year came out with a number of juice products and as you are aware from our loss but we only came out with that in earlier about March this year and then we launched Java Monster at the end of... very end of April.  So we should have had sort of full back in March obviously our dollars were still continuing to grow nicely. We should have recouped that and we have in fact increased our market share now not only beyond the position in December but in fact prior than the position was at its peak in the middle of last year. So we are continuing to make in roads into the category and on our numbers by the way we measure it, we are up to about 24% share. Now but that is a measurement of our internal measurement of the category it is not all measure channels it doesn't measure Wal-Mart it doesn't measure Clapps and a number of other on premise location. So I want to make that clear in making that statement that is just our own internal measurement that we use.  In the same period Red Bull has basically lost some market share mostly above what they were in the middle of last year because they have the extra 12 ounce can but basically that also move from where they were in December they have got basically a 10 pre-boost by introducing the 12 ounce but it has come off somewhat. Rockstar is at a little bit on loss but it also down on niche from where they were in December. So that made some in roads and some margin share gains up to the end of the year but that is given in the lot of that back now and their offers well.  Full Throttle is also seeing to be off a little despite the fact that they have introduced a third and we now hear that are going to have a fourth version of the Full Throttle brand. On the other side of competitive side Pepsi products there are so be no clear and so be adrenaline rush or both of the product substantially in market share, those brands seem to be weakening quite substantially. The end brand seems to be putting some attention to that plant, put their effort behind that brand so that brand and that line extended into a 16 ounce and 24 ounce can size. Its given them a little bit of an increasing market share but its still relatively small, its still actually trailing or about shortly below Full throttle and so we just believe that that's really just kind of a lot of there Mountain Dew consumers because it is a Mountain Dew brand and so we think that it is walk through respectable brand that beginning that's going to be a major threat going down in the future in the category. The Cadbury itself is still continuing to be very healthy, we are seeing obviously slight decrease in the changes but really that just has to be accepted I mean where we are trying to go from much bigger category now it is continuing to grow at substantially bigger numbers. The category is up in 13, in the convenience channel which is the major channel, in the 13 weeks ended June 30th, its up 42.4%. Monster as a brand in that period is up about 52% in that channel. So we are continuing to gain market share which is really gratifying for the brand. The [indiscernible] which I mentioned earlier are largely complete, we sort of put a break on some of the professional arrangement during summer so that we could get ourselves focused on selling and rather not... focusing on product transition, brands and dealing with a number of issues that are with that. We will probably continue to do a little bit of transitions after the summer, but by and large we are generally done in our minds at the moment with the transition. We think that is working for us, we are getting good solid distribution, we are working with professional distributors, and so we are all generally very happy.  On the on-premise opportunity that is getting going. We are starting to open accounts in on-premise. We are starting to employ people who are going to be focused purely on the on-premise working together with the aiming people, they are employing people. It's probably taking a little more time than we would have liked and we might have anticipated but it is a big channel, it has to be right. It's not going to be opened in the day. There are many existing agreements with competing brands and competing beverages that encompass energy drinks even though they may not be selling them. At least in many cases we got to look at those contracts and see whether we have an opportunity to supply this, to spark the contract or wait for the contact to expire. And these happen when they renew all the time. But that's -- so it is a longer process to do it on a as large a scale as we are hoping to do it and we are moving ahead with it.  On the expansion front with international our sales in Canada where we transitioned to the Pepsi system are doing very well. The brand is doing very, very nicely there. It's growing so that was a positive transition. We are working well with the Pepsi system. It is a challenge to work with a well established system who have their own product and it is very different to working with an independent distributor. And so there are challenges that you got to overcome and resistance for change internally but it is working very well and we are very happy with the arrangements and we think that, there was well. So we think all was well as we continue to make product inroads [ph] and we are gaining quite a bit of market share in Canada.  We are also supporting the Canada market now, we are doing promotions in Canada, we supported the Canadian Motocross series and there were number of events BMX Downhill Racing series and whistler [ph]. So, we are doing quite a bit to obviously support the brand now in Canada. The expansion into Mexico, that has been very, very well received. The brand is well received in the... area we had by far the largest share of market there. In the rest of Mexico we have distributed to the Capri Group that is continuing to do well for us, we are the number two brand and we all are obviously very happy with that expansion. As I have indicated we are starting to take steps towards expanding into other areas internationally. We are slotting to re-interviewing distributors and the personnel. We want to get the right mix. We have got lot on our plate with the introduction of job over the other products. So we don't want to rush that.  I understand that and what investors might want to know, would like to see results moving more quickly into Europe but the fact of the matter is that we can't rush in and make a mistake and not do it right. We are looking at sponsorship opportunities there, we are involved in some motor sports that translate very well into Europe. We have got that motor sport share and we are looking to extend their end agreements and to go into Europe and other places. So that is happening and hopefully probably I will be able to report more on that and some progress as we go into the... when we report on the next quarter. By and large we are really very happy with our results.  Finally just to go through a couple of small numbers. As you will notice from the gross and the net we have continued to improve our efficiency in the spin that we have to achieve ourselves. Last year we out rose to net which was after our marked development funds, chain CMA fees, and allowances, etc were 16.7%, in this quarter it will be down to 14.6%. Distribution cost generally we've managed to achieve quite a lot of efficiency, we are down from 6.9% in the comparable quarter last year to 5.4% this quarter. We have opened up a number of additional production and distribution facilities and that has obviously helped those items as we go forward.  One of the items I talked about last time was sponsorships that has increased as percentage versus last year. We think it is coming down as a percentage overall and will continue to level off over the year. But that is an increased item and merchandise display is again, we really are... the bad news is it is costing us more to put out merchandise but the good news is they are actually going up in stores and not being thrown away. So we think it is an effective and good use of our cash to get these displays up in stores that is important point to sell for us at the point of purchase and so that amount we have continued to spend quite a lot. As a percentage it is pretty much the same as what we spent in the same period last year but it is a big amount and that's why I do refer to it.  Costs have gone up slightly on our selling side 8.7 to 10.6 but then also a large portion of that increase in really is the commissions and royalties, principally commissions and amount that were payable to Anheuser-Busch as part of the Anheuser-Busch arrangements. In addition we could take that amount with the addition of the increase in sponsorships that pretty much accounts for that increase in selling expenses I think that pretty much of covers the individual items. I would like to go through it, I would like to open the call now to interested investors and be happy to take your calls.  Question And Answer 
Operator: Thank you sir. [Operator Instructions]. And we will go first to Dara Mohsenian of JP Morgan. 
Dara Mohsenian - JP Morgan: Hi guys. 
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Dara. 
Dara Mohsenian - JP Morgan: Can you give us an update on your plans with 16 ounce energy pricing, do you have any plans to raise pricing at some point this year? 
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We do have plans. What we are doing is we are going to... we are pretty close to raising costing partially in one of the channels as we have which is the channel through the club stalls and that's going to be more imminent and then we will probably look towards the end of the year for costing on 16 ounce for the remainder of the market. 
Dara Mohsenian - JP Morgan: Okay, and do you think is that more in the mid single-digit range or some of the 24 ounce more in the high single range, can you give us some sense? 
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I really can't at this time because the party structures are little bit different, and so I can't give you a figure at this point. 
Dara Mohsenian - JP Morgan: Okay and how has the 24 ounce price increase gone so far in terms of push back from distributors? 
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: That is... we think that has been acceptable. Everybody is... obviously nobody is keen to see an increase but I think our distributors have understood what we are up against on that and that we have the lower margins and we believe that in fact the consumers are prepared to pay but we don't think there is a resistance level from consumers because they are getting value on that package compared to the 16 ounce which has pretty much set the yard stick for it. So that hasn't been a major problem for us. 
Dara Mohsenian - JP Morgan: Okay, thanks. 
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you 
Operator: And we will go next to Andrew Sawyer with Goldman Sachs. 
Andrew Sawyer - Goldman Sachs: Hi guys, I was wondering if you could help square something up for me. I think one thing I have struggled with as far as the numbers is your sell in versus your sell through and one thing that has kind of deviated this quarter is that the numbers they get from scanner data whether it is sea stores or food stores they didn't track as well versus what you reported, so I was wondering if you can maybe elaborate on what you are seeing in unmeasured channels and maybe some learnings you have got from the budnet system that you now have some access to? 
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It really is a difficult exercise and we simply can't pinpoint it but what we have always seen basically there is a difference and it just is no different this quarter. One of the large sectors for us where we are doing a lot of business is in Trupp stores, Wal-Mart stores, unmeasured channels and so our products in those channels have continued to improve and it is doing very nicely and so that is really I would think the major reason for the discrepancy and in we are doing some on premise business and that is also not mentioned. We do a lot real small independent business independents don't also show up the any if these, even if you look at the Neilson for convenience that's really, it is convenience shine at the certain amount and its an extrapolation, so you will also were taking account that meal set is an extrapolation its some times does doesn't reflect exactly it gives you a direction and an idea but you can't use it as a absolute bible I mean the fact of the factor our sales are we've got. There is obviously a lead time but it is not a large lead time because our customers don't hold many weeks of stock of inventory. 
Andrew Sawyer - Goldman Sachs: Right and I guess kind of separate follow on question I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about Java Monster and what kind of repeat purchases you are seeing and any update on, where you are and gaining for capacity for that products and are you seeing the bump up against this during the quarter? 
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: What has happened is obviously when you start up with new products, we try and be conservative and you... we sort of been though what it was it was a completely different product. We didn't know how it would be received. We obviously on the other side, we knew that we had a more professional distribution system out there and we put it out into the market and it has got a really good taking for and ready was well received not only by the buyers but very quickly by distributors by salesman and they've embraced it and they put themselves behind this and we got a lot of listings. What other issues we had with the existing listings is that what whole the buyers have accepted the product pretty much across the country and I am going to put it in a systematic in the coffee section in the interim stage the quick fix for as at a salesman level is to go in, it's a harder things to go and put it in the cut it into the coffee shop and take away slices from other competitors and products.  In the meantime we have got often two and three shelves of Monster very close to the coffee door but not in it and the easy fix is... the easy way out for the sales guys is to just take three phasing away from the regular Monster product and stick in that submit in the two shelves. And so we probably have a little more cannibalization than we think we should have had and we think we will be able to manage it better going forward when the schematic starts to get approved and we actually are able to transfer the phasing from the energy section into the coffee section.  On the actual sales it did roll up very nicely and we really started to get immediate pull. Again I think that we don't have statistics other than the fact from our distributors, our distributors put into account it pulled through very quickly there were sales they came back and ordered and we are seeing a lot of repeat orders from the same distributors and sales have been very strong. So once we got that sense we obviously started to look at ramping up production, but pretty quickly we bumped up against the production limit, the company that is manufacturing for us arranged to put on extra shifts and additional production and our production has doubled in August now it is doubled what it was in July.  Now going in September we're probably going to almost double it again they've had to completely train an entire shift of personnel and to go to a third shit and pretty we will get between I think about 70% more production going forward than we got in August which was in turn was more than double what we've had in July, So we've been able to ramp up but its taken a couple of months off the event to get everything in place and lined up with equipments and everything else to gear it up for this production.  We are also looking to making some plans to look for additional productions at basically at a fully aided company that might have a limited amount of production but we are not sure of whether that production will affect the taste of all of the brand. At the moment, the production we have now got geared up for us in September is very much high it was literally four times the production that we had in July and June. So we believe that we can sell the product the production. We haven't even begun to scrub the surface. We haven't started to introduce full pack of it. There are number of mass markets that we haven't gone to because you just can't go to them and run out there is no purpose.  Grocery stores that hasn't gone into, we are making presentations and obviously that takes longer to get into the stores to get their sets done whereas in the convenience channel we are all waiting for schematic changes I indicated earlier at least there is an opportunity to get onto the shelves in the mean time its pretty much that doesn't exist in the case of grocery, you really do have to get your shelf reset. And as of it on the mass side, club side all of that we really done nothing because there was just no purpose in going out and selling out and finding we didn't have production. So the ramp up of these brands has default quicker and fall higher then the ramp up of any of our other product introductions. Now we do understand that this is three product versus often one line extension at a time, but be that as it may that was to an established product and with the ramp up has been just been great. There is a high cost of production and we just from a prudent point of view we just didn't want to go up and run up massive quantities in the hope that it would take and then you serve. One of the issues we had with that there is a shorter shelf life good Java Monster then there is with our regular Monster products because largely because of the fact that its got interrupt.  It's a retail process and its got a move solid and premise [ph] and we really don't know what the shelf is that's an unknown entity for us. But the indication is all to start it's going to be... it is much shorter than regular Monster and even then we are not sure until we've actually had the product for the length of time whether time is going to affect the tasting anyway. So, we are obviously cautious about just launching into it with a lot of fan feel [ph] and then further we got we stuck with the lot of inventory. So, is ramping up the product is really doing nicely. We are planning some extensions to the products, some line extensions already. Going forward for the... which we hope to launch within the next quarter. There is a long testing procedure in getting government clearances with a retail product, we are going through that now and but we will be launching that additional product as soon as in the near future. We are also planning to launch an additional product in the 32 ounce can for Monster and probably willing to have an additional flavor as well. So, those all plans also going forward. So, we are pretty excited about the new product particularly the Java Monster line overall. And by overall continued growth and in the energy category. 
Andrew Sawyer - Goldman Sachs: Oh!. Thank you very much Rodney. 
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Pleasure. 
Operator: We will take our next question from Greg Badishkanian of Citigroup. 
Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup: Great. Thank you. Hey Rodney just a few quick questions for you. Did you just mention a 32 ounce is that sort of a like a single serve or is that going to be something that can be stored in a refrigerator after may be checking or serving of two of it? 
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well. You can store in the refrigerator but that at the moment there isn't an ability to have that in a cap can. 
Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup: Right. 
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: And so its not re-sealable water it really can be stored if probably its going to be something that will be consumed relatively quickly it may not be one serve but it maybe over a couple of hours whatever. But it is what it is bigger is better we think demand for us. 
Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup: Yes, its interesting to see that the consumers of that product. 
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We also think that's a good product that we are trying to look at on an offer on premise. 
Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup: Right and just sort moving over to on premise big opportunity for you can you it may be more terms of like how you see that revolving over the next year too? 
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We really... it really is speculate we just don't know, we know what's out there. We know the accounts we know the opportunity but we just really store in the planning and execution stages, it is taking time as I indicated earlier its probably a little longer than we would have liked but the gain we have a very substantial partner in it and there are large corporation and things just don't happen overnight in any large corporation unfortunately. But you know it is going at a good price and we are very confident that we are going to be able to make real in road in that section but it is going to take time and everything takes time, even the transition to the AIB system. I think everybody wonder sort of instant gratification. And it just doesn't happen like that we would level to happen and you can see that why it should happen but just because you go into a, say a territory where you have very low distribution you get low recognition for your brand now you get a distributor he does his job, he puts it on the shop, he get you with the facings. It doesn't happen that within a week later you find out the store and the sales have doubled. You have got to get the consumer, he is got to get used to seeing it, he goes it and it sees no now its more visible. This is going to take him time before he puts it and before he tries. This all takes time and so I know that there has been the analysis on the pre-bud transition and the post bud transition, these things do take time. In some markets we have disappointments but by and large we are very happy with the improvement, the policy of our distribution and ourselves have improved pretty much in most of the bud markets, and that we been into. And it is going to happen. We think it is just a long haul, it is building yourselves in a single-can but it is happening and we are continuing to increase our market share for big base as you are aware. And so, I think that is the proof in reporting on that. It is happening for us and it will continue to we think improve as we go forward and the same thing applies to the on-premise. We think it is going to take time but it is going to happen and it is going to happen well for us. We are seeing some results coming already but it is obviously, we have got much higher expectations than what we are seeing at the levels we are seeing now. 
Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup: Good and just on the competitive environment, what type of price increase have you seen from other competitors, from Red Bull and what you expect to see from the major competitors? 
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We really haven't seen any product increases. It just depends on the period you are getting. There is no product increase at the frontline. What you are seeing is just the right people of the marking. In some cases they are promoting more aggressively and other cases less aggressively. So we are not seeing any product increases yet. So, I think that we may see some through but we haven't seen anything fall out from the main competitors. 
Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup: Would you expect to see a price increase and would you need to see that to maybe increase prices on a more broader scale at the end of the year like you were talking about? 
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I don't think so. I think that obviously it just makes easier for everybody to like it if any of our competitors do increase, but ultimately we feel that by the end of the year we probably will increase. Again, we haven't made a final decision but we think we'll increase and we think the competitors will probably follow. If they don't, we don't think it will affect the sales. We think we have enough of a market and as long as we have been doing something revolutionary we think that the increase will be palatable both to the retailers and to consumers particularly bearing in mind the value relationship we see with our main competitor which is Red Bull. 
Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup: Great, thank you. Great job in the quarter. 
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks very much. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Mark Astrachan of Stifel Nicolaus. 
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Hey, good afternoon guys, couple of questions for you. First, wondering how deviated measure if you take away from your distributor in terms of sales from the distributor to retail and if its relatively easy to comment on how that has been trending over the last couple of quarters. 
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I am going to... I will dodge it. I don't know data from distributors to retail. 
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, I guess I am just trying to get a sense for general sort of demand here at retail versus what it is in terms of how you are shipping the product? 
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I will just assume... distributors don't keep inventory and probably one of our problems is they buy on too short notice, that's probably the biggest problem. What resale is going through, it is going to the retail stores and going to the consumers but your best bet at facing that is to use the Nielsen's because that reflects sales at a store level to consumers. I mean that's the only real yardstick, I mean we use that as much as anybody else really. 
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, that's fair enough. Shifting gears a little bit to what you would talk about for July trends, could you talk a little bit about what the comparisons were versus 2006 and I guess in particular if you could talk a little bit about how the month by month volume trends were in the third quarter last year, a July, August, December sort of thing in terms of what we are looking at from a comparison standpoint? 
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I don't have the numbers for August and September, may be I will be able to get them and comment later in the call. On... prior year we had a pretty good July. Obviously, we are just treading up on additional numbers, prior was the first... one of the first months I think that we had exceeded $50 million in our Monster sales on a gross basis. So, it was a pretty good month. But we just really hope for a pretty good year. I will try and get the figures on a monthly basis so I can answer your question and I will come back to that, I don't have an ability to really answer you on that at this point, Mark. 
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Alright, and then in terms of breaking out the DSD versus warehouse segments, can you typically give a little bit more color there in terms of revenue, in terms of contribution, and maybe even volumes, if you could give that it would be helpful? 
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure, DSD in the three months ended June 30th, DSD net sales was $220,428,000 and warehouse was $24,335,000 compared to $131,976,000 and $24,061,000 in the warehouse. Contribution margin from the two was $74,982,000 from DSD $934,000 from warehouse, and the three months royalty was $51 million from DSD and $1,678,000 from warehouse. In the six months DSD net sales was $363,722,000 versus $238,067,000 the prior year. Warehouse was $46,893,000 versus $44,916,000. Contribution margins were adjusted for the six months and a $122,317,000 versus $99,035,000 last year and warehouse contribution margin was $1,687,000 versus $3.497 million. Contribution margin from the warehouse division was as you see was essentially flat, just a couple of points up, and the contribution margin however, was substantially lower. That was due to... pretty much due to... margins and increased cost particularly across PET, Roll It [ph] apple juice which was a big component of the warehouse division. Apple juice cost have gone up and so that was probably the major, pretty much one of the major cost if not the major cost. We also had cost increases in sweeteners and obviously in cans and PET bottles. And those costs in that division clearly had a far greater impact on the bottom line than they have in the DSD division. So as a percentage geography there was a big swing down which we are obviously unhappy but we are also taking steps to try and deal with that and mitigate against it. We are also in the process, we are about to launch a new... completely new line of premium sparkling drinks that are sweetened with cane sugar. And so we are sort of looking at different ways of increasing products that will help better margins. In that division the kids juices, the junior juice, and kids effect juices [ph] are continuing to do very nicely and as of the main issue we face in that area was we are continuing to supply on a big contract, but we've had some cost increases when we didn't... initially when we entered into that contract we fixed the pricing for apple juice for 3 year. We hadn't fixed the fourth year which was an option which we decided to let to take and there has been an increase in apple juice pricing and that has helped margins quite a bit in that area. 
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Great, and the final question is, in terms of the growth in your DSD business, could you talk a bit about how the growth was in the region where the Anheuser-Busch distributors are selling the product versus what it was in I guess more of the legacy market? 
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We have seen growth, but I don't have that analysis. We just have not done it. Because there have been a number of factors, in some markets we obviously expect growth because we are in markets where we had low distribution but what we are seeing in those markets is very much improved distribution levels, there is no doubt about that. In areas that we were mature we are continuing to see improvements but whether those improvements would have been achieved by the distributors, we can go through a number of analysis, we just don't believe there is enough of a direction to have given us a feel. Have we improved our market share in Florida which was the first market, yes we have. Have we improved our distribution levels, absolutely. So, I think, you will ask me would I have done better with the existing distributor, I don't believe so. I believe in Florida we are doing substantially better with the AB system than we would have done where we were. In New York for example which is a major market, which is a great opportunity for us. We have a very small market share although, we are the number two brand in New York area. In that area we are very much behind Red Bull they have got a very commanding lead there. But we believe that's a great opportunity for us as what we are seeing are substantially improvements to the AIB distributor system there. We are actually taking steps to actually put some focus and more effort behind in New York market because we believe that is a growth opportunity for us. As opposed to some of the more mature markets. We are still having some issues in the Northern market we are not making the progress we would have liked. That we've made a lot of progress in Nevada which is a... we are getting some good on premise distribution there as well. That's another area that we have done well and so, its on the market by market basis. But overall we are pretty happy with the distribution system but I just don't have any analysis that would give me or that me to give you any real direction other than to say in general we there clearly has been progress but I just want major to our existing areas. 
Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus: Great. Thank you guys. 
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Joseph George of Thomas Weisel Partners. 
Joseph George - Thomas Weisel Partners: Good afternoon guys. Couple of quick questions. One is on the international front right now you have a presence in Canada and Mexico. At what stage will you have a level of comfort on your domestic front which will actually help you get aggressive on the international front? 
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I think we have at a level where we are comfortable going internationally. The question is where do we have more opportunity and how are dividing our attention. We all obviously happy with the domestic front. We still see good growth opportunities. We have increased our distribution levels probably closer to 90%, 85% now from 80% let me just get the CNG and I'll give you that figure for last year across the CNG channel we are up to 86% distribution which is 15% up on last year this time. So we are continuing to see opportunities here. We have opportunities in the club stall channels and the mass merchandiser channels which we just touching with we have listings you all modern types that I cant believed we actually are in the small percentage potential stalls in that we have the listings.  We have product line extensions for the brand which is excepted here which is obviously the money we are spending is being spent across the brand. So we see good opportunity in extending our line shelf and then we sold the... obviously what we did was we sold the growth opportunity for Java Monster net we don't have our planning since the end of last year and I think that is being borne out because we are seeing really good volumes on Java monster and we are very up on the brand. We are very positive we think that's going to make quite a big in road into that whole coffee section which is really been dominated by Starbucks and which is quite a big... we just think we could ever big chunk of that. So Walls International is good and international is important.  International is not going to happen overnight I mean Red Bull has been well established in Europe for well in excess of 10 years. I have got the majority share in that market are not going surrender that laughing they are going to defend it to they have got the share that known to consumers. So we are going to have to build in which means we are going to have to do it account by account block by block and build the brand. So those markets are great long term opportunities. The shorter term opportunities still for us is probably greater still in the U.S. because of where we think we can go with the brand.  Ultimately yes we recognize we need to and we also go international and we are doing it but we don't want to just rush in there and throw a lot of money against it on the basis that we just expected to work in, if we doesn't work then we are all sorry later we are just not the approach. We think we will spend the against it, we are all prepared to go into in the serious way but we think it has to be done sensibly. So we are on that track we are on the international track but we just had the opportunity, we focused on you have senior management Tom was focused on making a successive Java Monster. The one thing we didn't want is to simply try out a brand and then run around looking for other opportunities. To launch a bran like that and make an impact against the Starbucks brand and make an impact generally in the market it takes a lot of attention and time and that's our belief and so that's what we've be done and we think we've really made a real impression into that... in that market. So we are very happy and we will be expanding but it is going to come with time and it is going to come, it needs patience before it starts dropping a very... lot of money to the bottom line. Mexico and Canada were very much easier because a lot of our marketing shelves pulls over to those countries. A lot of the every thing that we do out here is more... its been official way without having do things whereas when you go to other international countries you really do have to establish things from the very bottom. 
Joseph George - Thomas Weisel Partners: Got it. The next thing I wanted to know was about your cost structure on the G&A front its held back quite well as a percentage of sales. Going forward especially in the context of on premise and the new product launches, what kind of investments have you made in the second quarter or what kind of additional investments in G&A will you expect going forward? 
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I think that investments on the general business let me just back up off the on premise from our general business we think that the investments going forward will be pretty much in line with what we have done in the past, we might get some efficiencies on some big items like as we increase sales because our budgets are down for the year on. Marketing are promotional spins, some of our promotional spins are not dependent on volumes that is said for the year, some of the affiliates and the sports endorsements and promotions. Some of the shelf program fees we pay which are big numbers to the chain tools that is offset for the year.  Some of the variables that go up or things like, merchandising equipments, coolers, merchandising aids, rack something's, then some of the NBA is on the per case basis where you do promotions. So those will go up and we think that they will go up a little more slowly but we also think that against that we will have a slight reduction in the gross margin through actual margin in certain of the products from the product mix dropping as the transition into more the DSD products flows because we are already bumping up against the 19 to 10 percentage level and against that we are obviously are trying to increase our share of 24 ounce is still continue to get traction, the juice products are continuing to get tractions and Java Monster an all of those are at a lower percentage than our traditional products in the Monster category. So those will put a little bit of pressure down so that even though we had thus gross profit which was early nicely up. This quarter over the last year and even over the last quarter we didn't that it will beat it's probably more likely to go down to the more normal level that we have seen in the past. 
Joseph George - Thomas Weisel Partners: Got it thank you 
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure. 
Operator: And with the time constraints that will conclude our question-and answer session. Mr. Sacks I will turn the call back over to for additional remarks 
Rodney C. Sacks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Alright thank you. Once again I want to thank everybody for their support. We are also very gratified to have received the letter which we announced yesterday that had been an end to the enquiry that had been out there. So we will believe out down our heads now and go forward and concentrate fully on the business and we think that you know obviously there is some litigation that still, the litigation that follows from that we don't believe the case is of merit but obviously takes time and definitely cost to continue to fight them.  We will do what we need to do on that front. However we do believe that the level of lieu cost obviously will now go down quite substantially because we limit to the cost relating to those... to that litigation and so we believe that item will go down. Similarly the amount of cost that will be incurred in distributor terminations will also go down dramatically, there are a couple of loose ins there, there are a couple distributors who haven't accepted settlements and there is a little bit of litigation going on and so subject to that we don't think that will be very material and those cost should also come down going forward and that is what we thought was important to obviously give you guys a sought of pro forma vision of the results without those costs.  The results for July again, we think that they shouldn't be too much reading into it we always do caution that one month doesn't make a summer. Its one month there were a number of factors we couldn't get some products out as I indicated earlier. We also had a shorter month and there were a number of factors. So we are very happy with the brand going forward as it happens last year just looking at some numbers.  So hold one minute as we look the numbers before we go for the first quarter asked the earlier question. Thanks. Hello. Just one of the things I have got some numbers for August in last year. there was quite a substantial increase in August over the July which we had a similar trend the June number last year was higher than the July number. Generally the South of build up to June and then had a drop of last year in July a little bit and then was quite a good increase in August and then continue to just slight drop back in September and then it started the level of but those were at much higher levels than earlier. So what we are doing is we are trading off labels now that are very much higher last year than the second quarter. So, they want that very sort of similar trend. Where June is higher July dropped often in August was substantially high. So just to give you that color and answer to that earlier question.  Okay. Thanks very much. We are happy with the results we are excited to go forward. We think we got great new product line. We got some new products coming and we are very excited about the second half of the year and for the category generally which is continuing to show really-really strong and solid results for us. Thank you once again for your support and hopefully we will be happy to able to report to you probably the results to you guys at the end of the third quarter. Thank you. 
Operator: And we conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.
