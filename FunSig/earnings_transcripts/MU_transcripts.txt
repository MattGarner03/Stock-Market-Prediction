Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Satya. Good afternoon, everyone. Micron is in the best competitive position in our history, and we are achieving share gains across high-margin product categories in our industry. Our strong product momentum has enabled us to build deeper customer relationships, and Micron's industry-leading products are now more firmly entrenched in our customers' high-value product roadmaps. In fiscal Q2, data center DRAM revenue reached a new record. HBM revenue grew more than 50% sequentially to a new milestone of over $1 billion of quarterly revenue. Our HBM shipments were ahead of our plans, demonstrating strong execution of our ongoing ramp. The combination of our revenue from high-capacity DRAM modules and our industry-leading LPDRAM for the data center also exceeded the $1 billion milestone for the quarter. Micron remains the only company in the world to ship low-power DRAM into the data center in high volume, showcasing our pioneering innovation and deep partnership with our customers for differentiated solutions. As we build on this momentum, we expect fiscal Q3 revenue to be another record for Micron, driven by shipment growth across both DRAM and NAND. We see the combination of AI data center demand and the ramp of HBM and its associated trade ratio contributing to tightness at the leading edge and constraining non-HBM DRAM supply. We expect supply actions announced by NAND companies to improve the dynamics in the NAND market. Micron's 1-beta DRAM technology leads the industry, and we are extending our leadership with the launch of our 1-gamma node and the industry's first shipments of 1-gamma-based D5 products last month. Micron's 1-gamma is our first DRAM node incorporating EUV, and we have achieved 20% lower power, 15% better performance and over 30% improvement in bit density compared to our 1-beta DRAM. Micron's leading-edge Gen9 NAND technology node delivers the industry's fastest TLC-based NAND, and we are managing the ramp of this node, mindful of the supply-demand balance in the industry. Micron continues to make disciplined investments that position us to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities driven by AI. We are focused on growing HBM capacity in our existing manufacturing facilities to meet requirements through 2026. In January, we broke ground on an HBM advanced packaging facility in Singapore. This investment allows us to meaningfully expand our total advanced packaging capacity beginning in calendar 2027. Our new DRAM fab construction in Idaho completed an important construction milestone that enabled the receipt of the first disbursement of funding from our CHIPS grant for the project during the quarter. This new Idaho fab will provide meaningful DRAM output starting in fiscal 2027. Turning to our end markets. Dramatic improvements in computation hardware have reduced the per-token cost of generative AI models. These hardware improvements, along with more efficient algorithms and software, drive down the cost of inference and make generative AI-based capabilities more accessible to new applications and use cases. This broadening deployment creates a powerful growth vector for aggregate AI demand, and recent innovations and those in the pipeline from key contributors to the AI ecosystem will continue to fuel this growth trend. As GPU and custom AI accelerate our performance capabilities continue to improve with each new generation of product, these high-performance processors are starved of memory bandwidth. HBM memory provides the bandwidth necessary to leverage these powerful processors in the most effective and efficient manner, and we are excited to see the growth opportunities ahead for this complex and high-value product category where our customers now recognize Micron as the HBM technology leader in our industry. Recently, large hyperscale customers reiterated strong year-over-year growth for their capital investments in calendar 2025. We project mid-single-digit server unit growth in calendar 2025, with growth in both traditional and AI servers. We see strong demand for HBM and have once again increased our HBM TAM estimate for calendar 2025 to over $35 billion. We remain on track to reach HBM share similar to our overall DRAM supply share on a run rate basis in calendar Q4 2025. As previously mentioned, Micron has sold out of our HBM output in calendar 2025. We are seeing strong demand for our HBM supply in 2026 and are in discussions with our customers on agreements for their calendar 2026 HBM demand. Micron's industry-leading HBM3E delivers a 30% power reduction compared to the competition. And our HBM3E 12-high has a remarkable 20% power advantage over competing 8-high products while providing a 50% higher memory capacity. We have begun volume production of HBM3E 12-high and are focused on ramping capacity and yield. We anticipate HBM3E 12-high will comprise the vast majority of our HBM shipments in the second half of calendar 2025. We are making good progress on additional platform and customer qualifications with HBM. Micron's HBM3E 8-high is designed into NVIDIA's GB200 system, and our HBM3E 12-high is designed into the GB300. In fiscal Q2, we initiated volume shipments to our third large HBM3E customer and anticipate additional customers over time. We expect multibillion dollars in HBM revenue in fiscal 2025. Looking ahead, we are enthusiastic about Micron's HBM4, which will ramp in volume in calendar 2026. Our HBM4 provides a bandwidth increase of over 60% compared to HBM3E. The timing of our HBM4 is aligned to our customers' requirements, and we are focused on delivering the best HBM4 products to the market across power efficiency, quality and performance. Our proven HBM product performance, our strong HBM road map and our demonstrated manufacturing excellence uniquely positioned Micron to capitalize on next-generation HBM4 and HBM4E solutions. Micron has led the adoption of LP in data center. In AI servers, Micron's LP lowers memory power consumption by over 2/3 compared to D5. We expect to maintain our leadership position in LP for server as it transitions from soldered components to SOCAMM, or Small Outline Compression Attached Memory Module form factor. Micron's SOCAMM was developed in collaboration with NVIDIA to support the GB300. LPDRAM in a SOCAMM form factor enables easier server, manufacturability and serviceability and helps drive broader LP adoption in the server market. We are on track to deliver multibillion dollars in revenue in fiscal 2025 from our portfolio of high-capacity D5 modules and LP products for the data center. In data center NAND, demand moderated in fiscal Q2 due to short-term customer inventory-driven impacts, and we see a return to bit shipment growth in the months ahead. In calendar Q4 2024, based on industry analyst reports, Micron achieved yet another record high market share in data center SSDs with revenue growth in each category, including performance, mainstream and capacity SSDs. Our high-performance 9550 SSD, which is on NVIDIA GB200 NVL72-approved vendor list, completed qualifications at multiple customers. During the quarter, we announced that Micron's data center class G8 QLC-based NAND components are qualified for production in pure storages, high-capacity 150-terabyte DirectFlash module. Micron's data center class NAND components give customers the ability to leverage our industry-leading NAND design and process technology in their custom storage solutions. Micron's leadership in QLC NAND supports the transition from HDD to NAND solutions in the data center. We expect to generate multiple billions of dollars in data center NAND revenue and once again grow our data center NAND market share in calendar 2025. We expect the PC market to grow mid-single digits in unit terms in calendar 2025, with growth weighted to the second half of calendar 2025. The Windows 10 end of life in October 2025, combined with an aging installed base and the desire amongst customers to ensure that their PC hardware specs can support compelling AI applications in the future, are key catalysts that drive this growth. AI PCs required a minimum of 16 gigabytes of DRAM, with many models requiring even higher memory versus the average 12 gigabyte PC content last year. During the quarter, we sampled our 16-gigabit 1 gamma-based D5 products to PC clients. In NAND, we launched our Gen9 based 4600 performance SSDs, the fastest in the world for the client market, and completed qualifications of our 2650 mainstream SSDs at multiple PC OEMs. Turning to mobile. Our expectations for smartphone unit volume growth in calendar 2025 remain at low single-digit percentages. Smartphone customer inventory dynamics have played out as anticipated, leading to mobile DRAM and NAND bit shipment growth in our fiscal Q3. AI adoption continues to be a significant driver for increased mobile DRAM demand. AI-capable flagship phones increasingly feature DRAM capacities of 12 gigabyte or higher compared to the 8 gigabyte in last year's models. Smartphone OEMs are using Micron's industry-leading 9.6 gigabit per second LP5X DRAM to improve AI performance, delivering up to 20% more tokens per second than those using legacy speed grades on the same SoC. During the quarter, we announced that our LP5X DRAM and UFS 4.0 NAND were featured in the high end of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Series. Micron's mobile DRAM and UFS storage solutions are in high demand and will continue to launch in flagship and high-end smartphones throughout the year. Additionally, we are now sampling the industry's first mobile G9 managed NAND-based UFS 4.1 solution in densities of 1 terabyte. Automotive OEMs, industrial and consumer embedded customers are in the later stages of adjusting their inventory levels. In automotive, which comprises the largest portion of our EBU revenue, memory and storage content per car continues to increase as AI-enabled in-vehicle infotainment systems become more enriched and driver assistance functions become more capable. Advanced robotaxi platforms today contain over 200 gigabytes of DRAM, or 20x to 30x higher than the amount of DRAM in the average car. Micron is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend with our industry-leading portfolio of automotive products. During the quarter, we announced the production readiness of the industry's first automotive LP5X DRAM product that supports the 9.6 gigabits per second speed grid, addressing the increasing performance requirements of AI-driven applications in vehicles. Additionally, our 4150 SSD became the industry's first enterprise SSD product that is automotive qualified and is now sampling at target customers, further reinforcing our commitment to innovation and leadership in this important market. Now turning to our market outlook. Calendar 2024 DRAM bit demand growth was in the high teens, consistent with our prior expectations. Calendar 2024 NAND bit demand growth was approximately 10%, slightly below our previous view of low double digits. We forecast calendar 2025 DRAM bit demand growth in the mid- to high teens percentage range and NAND in the low double-digit percentage range. Over the medium term, we expect industry bit demand growth of mid-teens CAGR for both DRAM and NAND. As we have previously discussed, NAND technology transitions provide a significant increase in overall bit output. Sustained NAND industry supply demand balance can result from increasing the time between node transitions, along with sustained reductions in NAND industry CapEx and wafer capacity. NAND industry wafer capacity underutilization can help to improve the near-term dynamics in the NAND market. We expect Micron's supply growth in calendar 2025 to be lower than industry demand growth for both DRAM and NAND. We expect our inventory days to decline as we move through calendar 2025. We expect to maintain our bit share in DRAM and NAND in calendar 2025. In DRAM, we expect a strong ramp of HBM throughout calendar 2025. As noted before, HBM3E consumes 3x the amount of silicon compared to D5 to produce the same number of bits. Looking ahead, we expect the trade ratio to increase with HBM4 and then again with HBM4E when we expect it to exceed 4:1. The sustained and significant increase in silicon intensity for the foreseeable future contributes to tightness for industry leading-edge node supply and constraints capacity for non-HBM products. In NAND, we continue to underutilize our fabs, and our wafer output is down mid-teens percentage from prior levels. We plan to reuse a portion of our underutilized NAND equipment to support capital efficient conversions to leading-edge nodes. This strategy results in over 10% structural reduction of NAND wafer capacity exiting fiscal 2025 compared to levels exiting fiscal 2024. We will continue to prudently manage our NAND supply, including the levels of our capital investment, the pace of ramp of our new technology node, SaaS capacity and utilization, consistent with our demand growth. Our capital spending plans remain unchanged at approximately $14 billion for fiscal 2025. A significant portion of our capital investments are focused on multiyear facility investments to support our DRAM and HBM manufacturing, including our Idaho fab, Singapore HBM advanced packaging facility and Taiwan DRAM test facility. Micron will remain disciplined with our overall equipment investments to manage our supply growth consistent with demand. On tariffs, Micron serves as the U.S. importer of record for a very limited volume of products that would be subject to newly announced tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. We continue to monitor the possibility of future tariffs and are prepared to work with our customers and suppliers to understand future tariff effects and supply chain options that may arise. Where tariffs do have an impact, we intend to pass those costs along to our customers. With that, I will now turn it over to Mark for our financial results and outlook.
Mark Murphy: Thank you, Sanjay, and good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered fiscal Q2 EPS above the guidance range and revenue and gross margin within the range. Total fiscal Q2 revenue was approximately $8.1 billion, down 8% sequentially and up 38% year-over-year. Fiscal Q2 DRAM revenue was $6.1 billion, up 47% year-over-year, and represented 76% of total revenue. Sequentially, DRAM revenue decreased 4%, with bit shipments decreasing in the high single-digit percentage range and prices increasing in the mid-single-digit percentage range as a result of improving portfolio mix. Fiscal Q2 NAND revenue was $1.9 billion, up 18% year-over-year and represented 23% of Micron's total revenue. Sequentially, NAND revenue decreased 17%, with bit shipments modestly higher and prices decreasing in the high-teens percentage range. Fiscal Q2 bit NAND bit shipments were above our expectations, driven by higher consumer-oriented shipments. Now turning to revenue by business unit. Compute and Networking business unit revenue was up 4% sequentially to $4.6 billion and reached 57% of our total revenue. For the third consecutive quarter, CNBU revenue reached a new quarterly record, driven by a more than 50% sequential increase in HBM revenue. Revenue for the Storage business unit was $1.4 billion, down 20% sequentially. Decline in SBU revenue was driven primarily by lower storage investments from data center customers after several quarters of very strong growth and overall NAND industry pricing. Mobile business unit revenue was $1.1 billion, down 30% sequentially, as mobile customers continue to improve their inventory positions. Embedded business unit revenue was $1 billion, down 3% sequentially. Lower sequential revenue was primarily due to inventory improvement initiatives at automotive customers. The consolidated gross margin for fiscal Q2 was 37.9%, down 160 basis points sequentially due primarily to pricing and consumer-oriented segments of the market, especially in NAND and NAND mix shift to consumer-oriented products, as mentioned earlier. Our ongoing high-value mix shift in our DRAM portfolio partially offset some of these factors. Operating expenses in fiscal Q2 were $1 billion, flat sequentially. R&D expenses were lower than planned due to earlier product qualification and timing of certain R&D projects. We generated operating income of $2 billion in fiscal Q2, resulting in an operating margin of 24.9%, which was down approximately 260 basis points sequentially and up 21 percentage points from the year ago quarter. Fiscal Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $4.1 billion, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 50.7%, up 10 basis points sequentially and up 14 percentage points or $2 billion from the year ago quarter. Fiscal Q2 taxes were $214 million on an effective tax rate of 10.7%, lower than our guidance due to the effects of onetime items in the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in fiscal Q2 was $1.56, above the high end of the guidance range compared to $1.79 per share in the prior quarter and $0.42 in the year ago quarter. Turning to cash flows and capital spending. In fiscal Q2, our operating cash flows were over $3.9 billion, and our capital expenditures were $3.1 billion, net of proceeds from government incentives. As a result, free cash flows in the quarter were $857 million. Our fiscal Q2 ending inventory was $9 billion or 158 days, up as communicated previously, and an increase of 9 days from the prior quarter. On the balance sheet, we held $9.6 billion of cash and investments at quarter end and maintained $12.1 billion of liquidity when including our untapped credit facility. During fiscal Q2, we extended our debt maturities through a $1 billion 10-year senior note offering and a $1.7 billion term loan, with proceeds principally used to pay down notes maturing in 2026 and the previous term loan balance. We ended the quarter with $14.4 billion in total debt, low net leverage and a weighted average maturity on our debt of 2032. Following quarter end, we renewed and increased the size of our 5-year revolving credit facility to $3.5 billion. This provides an additional $1 billion of liquidity and further improves our financial flexibility. Now turning to our outlook for the third fiscal quarter. We forecast growth in DRAM and NAND bit shipments in fiscal Q3. We forecast sequentially lower fiscal Q3 gross margin, which includes the effects of higher consumer-oriented volumes. NAND underutilization continues to weigh on gross margins. We project operating expenses in fiscal Q3 to be approximately $1.13 billion and fiscal 2025 OpEx to increase by over 10%, reflecting planned increases to support our portfolio of high-value products, including HBM. We expect DIO to decrease in the third fiscal quarter on higher bit shipments. We continue to project ending fiscal 2025 with tight DRAM inventories. For fiscal Q3 and Q4, we estimate our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 14%. In fiscal Q3, we forecast CapEx to be over $3 billion. Our CapEx projection for fiscal 2025 remains approximately $14 billion. The overwhelming majority of the fiscal 2025 CapEx is to support HBM, as well as facility construction, back-end manufacturing and R&D investments. Impacts from potential new tariffs are not included in our guidance, given the uncertainty around tariff timing, nature and implementation. With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for fiscal Q3 is as follows. We expect revenue to be $8.8 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in the range of 36.5%, plus or minus 100 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $1.13 billion, plus or minus $15 million. As mentioned, we expect the fiscal Q3 tax rate to be around 14%. Based on a share count of approximately 1.14 billion shares, we expect EPS to be $1.57 per share, plus or minus $0.10. In fiscal Q2, Micron delivered earnings above guidance range, achieved record revenues again in data center DRAM, ramped our leading HBM and released the industry's most advanced DRAM process technology. For fiscal Q3, we project record quarterly revenue at the midpoint of our guidance. We are focusing our R&D resources, exercising capital discipline and maintaining a strong balance sheet as we extend our leadership and tap into substantial growth opportunities ahead. I will now turn it back over to Sanjay.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Mark. Micron is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the transformative growth driven by AI from data center to edge devices. And we are on track for the record revenue and significantly improved profitability in fiscal 2025. We are confident in our ability to navigate the current market dynamics with disciplined investments and a focus on our high-value portfolio mix shift. This is the most exciting time I have seen for memory and storage, and Micron's innovations are at the forefront of this revolution. We are excited about the opportunities ahead and remain committed to delivering value for all our stakeholders. Thank you for joining us today. We will now open for questions.
Operator: And our first question for today comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: Back in mid-February at an investor conference, I know the team had walked us through the dynamics on a weaker gross margin profile during the May quarter. That's playing out, but you did anticipate an improved gross margin profile beyond this quarter, fiscal Q3. So is that still the case that we should see gross margin improvements maybe starting in fiscal Q4 and potentially beyond? And is that a possible data center and your consumer-related products? Is that across total DRAM and your NAND segments? Any color here would be great.
Mark Murphy: Sure, Harlan, this is Mark. I'll take that. So let me just make some comments about the third quarter. It is down sequentially, as we had indicated in the conference. And again, as we said in the conference down primarily due to higher mix of consumer-oriented volumes, lower CQ1 pricing on consumer-oriented markets and industry and can just generally, all that partially offset by higher HBM. We do see -- while down, conditions have improved since those public comments. And the updated view is reflected in the guide today. Now we're not providing guidance on the fourth quarter. However, we do expect gross margin to be up somewhat. There's always tailwinds and headwinds. As you know, on tailwinds, we do expect market conditions to improve. We do expect HBM and other high-value products to grow and contribute to mix improvement. Some headwinds, we do see NAND underutilization as we talked about. And actually, since our capacity has come down structurally, we're going to see less of those costs in the third quarter on period and see more of those costs hit us as inventory clears in the fourth quarter. It's still -- we've taken actions to manage the NAND supply, and that's important, and that part of the business is still getting its legs back under it, but we intend to take price action in the second quarter calendar and just -- to maintain supply discipline. And then we are going to see in fourth quarter, the beginning of some start-up costs related to construction activities and new node in DRAM that we're working. So in short, we would expect fourth quarter margins to be up somewhat from third quarter.
Harlan Sur: I appreciate that. And then, Sanjay, you increased your industry bit demand outlook from mid-teens last earnings to mid- to high teens this quarter for calendar '25 for DRAM. I assume part of it is the HBM related dynamics as you increased your TAM outlook for HBM this year. But is the team seeing any other segments within DRAM that are driving the better industry, this demand profile as the year unfolds?
Sanjay Mehrotra: We had projected that customer inventories will get in a better place by spring time frame in the consumer side of the business. And it's turning out to be the way we had projected. And of course, the smartphone and PC markets are also seeing more and more devices that have AI implemented. That drives content growth. So as customer inventories got closer to healthier levels, we are seeing resumption of purchases by customers, and all that plays into our guide for 2025 bit demand. And as you noted, of course, data center continues to be strong. And in data center, of course, HBM is a strong contributor towards revenue growth in terms of bit demand growth for data center, of course, high-density DIMMs, as well as LP where Micron leads the industry, all of these actually contributing towards the demand increase in 2025 as well.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line Timothy Arcuri from UBS.
Timothy Arcuri: Mark, can you give us a little detail on the fiscal Q3 guidance? You're guiding revenue up about $750 million. How much of that is coming from DRAM versus NAND? And I know you said that bits are up in both. But can you give us a sense of how much bits are up in each of those 2 markets? And then I had another question as well.
Mark Murphy: Yes. Tim, we've provided you the consolidated revenue number. You have the year-to-date figures on both revenue and DRAM, our revenue and bit growth and price for both DRAM and NAND. And then we've provided you a demand growth for the year in bits. So I think we've provided you the contours of the business, and you should be able to make some volume and price assumptions on the revenue outlook. We do expect bit growth in both DRAM and NAND in third quarter.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay. But I guess, Mark, can you say that you expect revenue growth in both DRAM and NAND as well?
Mark Murphy: DRAM with the HBM and data center exposure will be -- the bias of growth will be there.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay. Cool. And then -- so Mark, I mean, obviously, everything you're doing here is great. I think the -- bugaboo obviously is -- margins are still a bit low, certainly into the fiscal Q4. So I guess I had like a 2-part question. One, I know you don't want to guide fiscal Q4 margins, but do you think you can get back to what you just did in fiscal Q2 in fiscal Q4? And I guess, broadly, when does this stuff clear and sort of we begin to see the true goodness flowing through from HBM and from all the cost downs you're doing on the non-HBM DRAM side? So sort of when do we start to get kind of a clean gross margin number, if you will?
Mark Murphy: Tim, we're not going to provide a fourth quarter number. We have indicated that fourth quarter gross margins would be up somewhat from third quarter. I think as Sanjay mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're in the best position we've ever been in on technology and market exposure products. Manufacturing is operating very well. On the cost side, maybe to help you with the modeling, our all in DRAM costs for fiscal year '25, we expect to be flattish. Our all-in NAND cost for FY '25, in line with front-end cost reductions in the low double-digits. So we are taking supply actions on the NAND side, consists of underloading, reducing CapEx, delaying node transitions, as we talked about. And we're beginning to see some signs of improvement on that part of the business. On the DRAM side of the business, we know the continued HBM growth and broader data center. And then the lead edge on DRAM is tight, and we're, again, projecting our DIO levels to be below our target by the end of the fiscal year.
Sanjay Mehrotra: And Tim, I'll just add that, of course, we continue to be focused on increasing the mix of our revenue towards higher profit pools of the industry, both in DRAM and NAND. So in terms of our product portfolio, as we have said, it is best positioned. So continue to drive the product portfolio and mix, focusing on, really strengthened profitability. And demand trends we have talked about, I mean we feel good about DRAM demand trend. And of course, in NAND, the supply discipline will be important. We, of course, are extremely focused on that. And AI is benefiting our DRAM demand across data center and edge as well. And of course, our technology position, our product position and our cost position continues to be healthy.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen.
Krish Sankar: I have 2 of them, first, Sanjay or Mark. You've seen some of the memory prices improve of late. I'm just wondering how much of that is true end demand versus actually tariff-related pull-ins? And how sustainable do you think the industry pricing dynamics today are?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So of course, as we have indicated, the DRAM demand drivers as well as NAND on the consumer side of the business in smartphones, particularly in smartphones as well as in PCs are improving as the customers are getting closer to their normal inventory levels in the consumer market again, along the lines of what we had projected. PC, probably more second half of this year that we start seeing greater demand trend with respect to AI PCs and increasing penetration of AI PCs. AI PCs require greater DRAM content than what was in the past, we have talked about that last year, average 12 gigabyte in PCs and AI PCs with the NPU running at 40 tops or higher requires 16 gigabytes or higher. So these are good demand trends on the PC side and same thing happening on the smartphone side. You have seen several introductions and more of these are smartphones and more of them to be rolling out with AI smartphones that too have higher DRAM content greater than 12 gigabyte versus last year at 8 gigabyte. And of course, data center demand trend in DRAM continues to be strong as well. So all of this, I mean, first of all, demand trends are in a good place. And of course, on the supply side, leading-edge supply, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, as well as Mark just mentioned, leading-edge DRAM supply is tight. And certainly, that is happening because of increasing demand for the HBM and HBM trade ratio. And on NAND, the supply actions by various players and underutilization in the fabs certainly is improving the supply picture as well. So all of this is improving the demand/supply environment in the industry. And of course, we are well focused on driving an inflection towards higher pricing in CQ2 and we are well positioned with our products across the end market segments. And we really look forward to continue to maximize the opportunities for our business and continue to increase the mix of our business toward higher profit pools of the industry.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Got it. Thanks, Sanjay. And then a quick question on the gross margin side. Clearly, HBM3E 8-high is obviously a mature technology as you move to 12-high in HBM4. Would the yields might be lower than 8-high? Just kind of curious, does it have any negative impact on gross margins? Or is it de minimis at this point?
Sanjay Mehrotra: First of all, in HBM3E 8-high, I'm very pleased with how our team has executed. And we mentioned in the prepared remarks that we actually delivered greater volume of HBM3E versus our plans in our FQ2 and exceeded revenue for the first time, a major milestone of more than $1 billion. And HBM3E continues to do well with 8-high, our yields, our capacity ramp is going well. Our execution is going well. And all that experience of 8-high in terms of capacity ramp as well as yield ramp will, of course, help us as we ramp our 12-high. You know, we have announced before that we are now in volume production with our 12-high. Just like any other new product, and these are highly complex products, HBM is the most complex product ever made in the industry. These kind of complex products, of course, in the early stages, there is a yield ramp. We expect 12-high to, of course, have a premium over 8-high and of course, will continue to be accretive to our DRAM margins nicely as well. And we remain very focused in second half shifting the vast majority of the second half of the calendar year, shifting the vast majority of our volume to 12-high. And as we ramp that volume, of course, yields will continue to go up as well. And with that, by the end of this calendar year, as we shared with you, we expect to reach our share to be in line with our overall industry DRAM share.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley.
Joseph Moore: Great. I wanted to make sure I got the inventory targets right. So you're at 153 days and you'll be below the target model, which I think is 120 days in 2 quarters. And I guess if that's right that seems like a lot of reduction. Can you talk about how much volume do you need to do that? How much is the inventory kind of impacted by some of the HBM supply trends, things like that? Could you just characterize a little bit, how you reduce that much inventory?
Mark Murphy: Yes, Joe, it's Mark. So 158 days. I think it was the DIO in the second quarter. As we've talked about, conditions are tighter in DRAM than NAND. You've heard about the supply actions that we've taken on NAND. We have seen good volume growth there, and that is expected to continue. But the industry conditions are such that you've heard us talk about underutilization, reducing CapEx and delaying the node transition. On the DRAM side, as Sanjay mentioned, AI-driven growth and related to HBM and other product sets, but particularly HBM with the trade ratio is creating tightness in that market. And the target we have for inventories that we've stated before is 120 days, and we would expect to be below that on DRAM by -- in our fiscal fourth quarter.
Joseph Moore: Okay. Great. And did you guide inventory for this coming quarter with -- I assume that starts to come down now?
Mark Murphy: We just said that on days, that will go down through the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald.
CJ Muse: I guess first question, I to follow up on gross margins, Mark, is there a point where we're thinking about the underutilization charges and the period cost into kind of May and August on the NAND side? And then is there also a way to think about the incremental construction cost as we go into August and November?
Mark Murphy: Yes. So CJ, the -- we had less period costs in our third quarter here than we had originally projected in part due to the fact that we've structurally brought down our capacity. And so more of the underutilization charge will go into inventories, and then that will flush through that way versus a period cost. Those period costs, I'd say the under-absorption costs do weigh on gross margins in fourth quarter and into '26. Now even with that, the combination of growth in the business, the improved market conditions and the mix improvements, those will, we believe, result in somewhat higher gross margins in the fourth quarter. As it relates to start-up costs, the effect is relatively small on a sequential basis, third to fourth quarter. But as we approach wafer outs in Idaho, that number will increase through '26. And so we'll provide more color on that as our plans and timing is finalized.
CJ Muse: Very helpful. And a quick follow-up. You revised your HBM industry revenue outlook higher. Curious if there's a framework on how you're thinking about kind of first half versus second half for the industry?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Of course, the revenue in the second half as you go from 8-high to 12-high continues to go up because 12-high will be carrying a certain premium over 8-high. So if we have projected more than $35 billion for calendar year 2025 and a bigger portion of that in second half of calendar '25 versus first half. And more than $35 billion, of course, is the industry TAM for HBM that we have referred to here. And I'll just point out that, of course, with respect to HBM, there is expansion of HBM customer base taking place. Micron itself, now we are shipping to a third large customer that we have begun shipping our products to. So that also is contributing to the growth in HBM revenue in the second half as the customer base expands.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso from Wolfe Research.
Chris Caso: Yes. First question is with regard to the lower end of the market. And -- if you could tell us about what the exposure is, particularly on DRAM side, LP4 and DDR4. And I guess as you start to see growth in HBM, get some normalization in some of the consumer markets as you go to the second half of the year, I guess, is that going to be kind of -- have a de minimis effect on revenue and margins as you go into the second half?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So regarding D4 and LP4, last quarter in our earnings call, we had shared that our revenue from those products, LP4 and D4, for the remainder of the fiscal year, we have said at the time, corresponds to about 10% of our total company revenue. So we continue to see that for the remainder of the fiscal year. And your second question is that -- can you repeat the second question?
Chris Caso: Yes. It's just -- does that have a de minimis effect on margins? I guess the point is, does that cease being a drag on margins as you go into the second half as other parts of the business grow?
Sanjay Mehrotra: I mean it is a smaller part of the overall company revenue. And it is -- I mean, we are, of course, leading in D5 and HBM. And D5 based and LP5-based product in data center as well as other parts of the consumer markets. So of course, LP4 and D4 will continue to become smaller over time. And just keep in mind that, overall, industry conditions in DRAM are improving from the point of view of DRAM demand drivers and the supply tightness. And that can also play some role in the overall dynamics of all parts of the DRAM market.
Chris Caso: As a follow-up on HBM, what you said in the past is you sold out for the year. But yet, your TAM assumptions have moved higher for the past several quarters. As we look into next year, presumably, the higher TAM this year translates to higher TAM assumptions as you go to next year. Are -- do you still have the capability to increase your capacity to maintain that market share in HBM, which is equal to our overall share of DRAM as you go into next year?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So of course, we have said that as we exit calendar '25, our share in HBM will correspond to our industry DRAM shares. So if you look at that run rate, I mean, clearly, in calendar year 2026, our share would be higher for the full year basis versus 2025. And we remain very focused on continuing to increase our capacity of HBM. I mentioned earlier that we are doing executing quite well in terms of continuing to increase the capacity, continuing to shift from 8-high to 12-high, very much focused on bringing HBM4 into the market next year and, of course, addressing all the capacity needs related to that as well. So while we are not projecting 2026 market share at this time, we feel very good about our HBM position, our close relationships with our customers, our execution on our technology and products and our manufacturing overall.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely from Citi.
Chris Danely: Thanks. So if we look at the May guidance and then just going back the last 3 quarters, your revenue is between $7.8 billion and $8.8 billion per year. And the last time that happened was about 3 years ago, that was the last upturn but your gross margins were 10 points higher. So why are gross margins -- because depreciation hasn't changed that much? Why are gross margins like 10 points lower at essentially the same revenue base? And does this mean that we can forget about your gross margins ever going to the 50s again? Or maybe give us a path to getting them back there, if you think that that's conceivable?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Overall, our gross margins in DRAM have been healthy and again, supported by our strong technology and product positions based on our D5 products, LP5 products, HBM products. NAND is what has weighed down on our margins. And of course, we have continued to focus. And NAND, it is because of the overall industry environment and overall industry demand/supply imbalances. And so of course, both in DRAM and NAND, it's always a function of demand/supply environment but also very much a focus of ours on increasing the mix of the business towards high-value solutions. And that's what we continue to do in NAND as well. And as we see a greater supply discipline, we would certainly fully expect that NAND fundamentals would improve in the industry as well. Of course, it's important to maintain the focus on sustained supply discipline there as well. So as we look ahead, we -- as we have pointed out, that we remain very focused on continuing to strengthen the mix of our revenue, mix of our products in the business towards higher-margin products, both in NAND and DRAM, continue to focus on product portfolio strength, managing demand supply very closely and managing our technology development and ramp into production closely to make sure that our supply and demand is well aligned and of course, very much focused on overall costs as well. And with that, we are certainly optimistic here that the structural overall with the industry that the improvements will occur in the business fundamentals.
Chris Danely: Thanks, Sanjay. Just 1 brief follow-up on that. So you talked about increasing the mix to higher-value solutions. And then in the commentary and also in the press release, you said that part of the reason that the gross margin was lower was this increasing consumer exposure. And your NAND actually was down a lot more than DRAM. So are you seeing increased consumer exposure in DRAM? And why is that happening? And how do we -- or how do you guys change that?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Well, first of all, we are doing well in data center and our mix of business in data center for DRAM, as we have pointed out, continues to increase. And we have leadership products in DRAM with data centers, including, not just HBM, but we have also talked about when we just announced -- SOCAMM products, these are important products. So doing well with respect to DRAM. On the consumer side, of course, over the last few quarters, there was overhang of customer inventory on the consumer side, and that was there in DRAM as well. And as that customer inventories get closer to normalization along the lines of what we have said before, of course, along with the AI drivers in consumer devices, we see a strong bounce back particularly in smartphones with respect to demand. And that's causing actually overall HBM trade ratio as well as a strong bounce back in the consumer demand is causing tightness in leading edge as well. And of course, these fundamentals of demand and supply enable us to drive inflection in pricing higher in CQ2 timeframe. And same thing on the NAND side that supply actions that have been taken in the industry as well as consumer inventories -- on the -- customer consumer inventory is getting normalized, is bringing back demand on the NAND side as well. And of course, we'll be driving inflection in pricing higher on the NAND side as well in CQ2.
Operator: And this does conclude the question-and-answer session as well as today's program. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2025 Q1  (2024-12-18 18:00:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to Micron's Post Earnings Analyst Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now, I would like to introduce your host for today's program, Satya Kumar, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Please go ahead, sir.
Satya Kumar: Yeah. Thank you, Jonathan, and thank you. And welcome to Micron Technology's Fiscal First Quarter 2025 Post Earnings Analyst Call. Joining me today are Sumit Sadana, Micron's Chief Business Officer; Manish Bhatia, EVP of Global Operations; and Mark Murphy, our CFO. As a reminder, the matters we are discussing today include forward-looking statements regarding market demand and supply, market trends and drivers, and our expected results and guidance and other matters. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today. We refer you to documents we have filed with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-Q and upcoming 10-Q for a discussion of risks that may affect our results. Although, we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance and achievements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results. We can now open the call to Q&A.
Operator: Certainly. And our first question for today comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your question please.
Harlan Sur: Hello. Thanks guys for hosting this call back. So I've got two questions. On the 100 basis point decline in gross margin in Q2, as you guys mentioned, it's almost all NAND related mixed, pricing, lower shipments. But qualitatively, like, what are you guys anticipating for DRAM pricing, where you talked about positive mix impacts, HVM, server DRAM, partially offset by weak commodity pricing. So I guess my question is, blended DRAM pricing up sequentially in Q2?
Sumit Sadana: Yeah. I think, we don't really guide for pricing. I think we have given you a lot of data points that can help you in your modeling, but we are not going to provide guidance on the actual pricing expectation for competitive reasons. And I think the overall set of comments that you heard in the prepared remarks and the comments that Sanjay and Mark made, basically, the mix improvement continues on a good trajectory. HBM growth continues on a good trajectory. Data center overall revenue trajectory continues to be robust. While we do have some near-term moderation in data center SSD after a lot of growth in the past quarters, the overall data center revenue trajectory remains very robust and we expect that to underpin our performance through fiscal and calendar 2025 and so those are the positives. And of course, we spoke about the near-term issues related to market environment, seasonality, NAND related challenges. So those are some of the headwinds. The mix and data center growth and overall DRAM robust results is what is helping us ensure that the margin for rest Q2 is still fairly similar to what we have in F Q1 in terms of 100 basis point only delta despite some of these headwinds we mentioned in some of the other areas.
Harlan Sur: No, that's helpful. And then maybe to follow-up, one of the -- and I've said this before, right, one of the big Micron specific inflections has been the strong increase in your enterprise and data center SSD share, right? I mean, you guys have always been strong in SATA. Mainstream PCIe and NVMe is where you guys have gone from like 3% to 5% market share in calendar '21 to 10% to 12% exiting last year. I think in Q3, your share was like 14%, and it grew sequentially again in fiscal Q1. So my guess is $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion of data center SSD, that’s like, 65% of your overall NAND business. You guys are now the number two or number three market share leader. I know enterprise SSD can be lumpy as you mentioned, right, that's impacting Q2. But do you guys expect sequential reacceleration in data center SSD in fiscal Q3 and just overall growth in data center SSD business fiscal '25 and calendar '25 just because AI demand pull for those products is just so strong?
Sumit Sadana: Yeah. I think you laid it out really well. We have made tremendous progress in our data center SSD business over the years. This has been an area we had been investing in for five, seven years now, and we have seen a tremendous rejuvenation in our product portfolio with industry-leading products now. So 30 terabyte SSDs. 60 terabyte SSD we just announced. First PCIe Gen5 60 terabyte SSD on the market. The 9550 fastest SSD in the world. So there are lots of these amazing products that have enabled us to get to a really solid performance, several quarters of record setting revenue and market share performance. So as we look ahead beyond the lumpiness you mentioned, beyond that, F Q2, we do expect a growth in bit shipments restarting in F Q3 for data center SSD and then continuing from there on into future quarters, that trajectory should grow because we do expect the overall data center CapEx from our end customers to remain strong, and that should enable us to get significant opportunity with the portfolio that we have that is now the strongest it ever has been in our history.
Harlan Sur: No, that’s very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.
Aaron Rakers: Yeah. Thanks for doing the call back and I have two questions as well. I guess the first question, Mark, I want to go back to kind of the Q&A in the prepared call. I'm trying to understand, like, you talked about constraints on gross margin into the fiscal third quarter. Trying to kind of frame the impact that you're thinking about from the underload. Is it 100 basis points? Is it 200? Is it less? And when you say constraints, are you implying -- are you necessarily implying that there isn't the potential or rather, is there a potential to see some gross margin positive drivers into fiscal 3Q relative to fiscal 2Q? Even with that underload charges, could we see gross margin flat to up? I'm just trying to understand a little bit of what you're trying to kind of frame as far as being constrained?
Mark Murphy: Yeah. So Aaron, we're not guiding third quarter gross margin. So we're just trying to be mindful to make sure that when we provide a number, it's a number that we have high conviction on. What we do know is that there are some unfavorable items that persist into the third quarter. The NAND challenging market conditions, we believe, extend into calendar Q1, which overlaps with our third quarter fiscal and so that's still an issue. And then as I mentioned, in the third quarter, the underload charges will begin to hit and those will hit in the form of period costs and then just some higher cost inventory. And that effect is, yeah, you mentioned 100 basis points to 200 basis points, closer to 100 basis points impact. And then there are definitely some favorable effects which continue to occur in second quarter and third quarter and beyond, and that is the most important thing on the call, and that is continued growth in data center, continued mix benefits from higher margin products, HBM, high capacity DIMMs, LPDRAM. And then as Sumit mentioned, volume growth and better market conditions in NAND, but volume growth in data center SSD is continuing. So all these items will, we believe, beyond the third quarter support margin expansion. And then finally, Aaron, we've been clear that we expect inventories to be up in the near-term because these volume declines in NAND and DRAM in the second quarter. DIO and dollars of inventory will be up. In DRAM, we're still very tight on leading edge and overall DRAM inventories are fine and to the point where through the end of the year, they will continue to improve from second quarter. And then, at the end of the year, where overall DRAM inventories will be below our target levels. And then NAND, as that market recovers, we expect NAND inventories while not as healthy as DRAM, NAND inventories will improve second to third to fourth quarter.
Aaron Rakers: Yeah. That's helpful. And then, as a quick follow-up, I know a lot of focus is placed on HBM understandably. But one of the things that you guys have highlighted over the last several quarters is LPDDR5X and obviously, getting into the Blackwell product cycle GB200 from NVIDIA. How would you characterize your views of that ramp and where you think Micron's relative share position is within those -- that LPDDR5x data center opportunity? I'm just curious. Thank you.
Sumit Sadana: Yeah. We are actually the pioneering memory supplier of LP in the data center. If you think about all of the market for LP in the data center worldwide, it is pretty much Micron driving that right now. Over time, there'll be others, but we are in the pole position of having driven the innovations that are needed for a data center to deploy memory that was not purpose built for data center RAS environment. So reliability, availability, serviceability that is built into DDR5 is not available in an LP solution. And Micron has made some important innovations in that product category. And hence, we are the ones who are really partnering with customers to drive this significant opportunity for us. And this is something that is a really important part of our overall strategy. It's an important part of our data center business. And when you combine this with the advantages that we have driven in the high capacity DIMM portion of the data center market where we were the first company with mono die-based 128 gigabyte DIMMs (ph), then you look at the overall advantage that we offer to customers with LP in the data center, high-capacity DIMMs in the data center, this -- these two categories for the data center in itself is going to be multi-billions of dollars. HBM separately is multiple billions of dollars. Data center SSD is going to be multiple billions of dollars. And the combined momentum of that is what you're seeing drove the 40% sequential growth in data center, 400% year-over-year in F Q1, and the greater than 50% of our revenue now that comes from data center.
Aaron Rakers: Okay. Thankyou.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from line of Chris Caso from Wolfe Research. Your question, please.
Chris Caso: Yes. Hi. I guess the first question is, maybe just some clarity on what may have precipitated some of the cautious -- some of the incremental caution here and what might have changed over the last couple of months? I know that is kind of back and forth a little bit, there were some cautious signs kind of back in August and they kind of received in the last earnings call. Was it -- I guess the question is, is it a function of the customer inventories turned out to be a bit more than we had expected or do you think it was a function of demand?
Sumit Sadana: Yeah. Let me try to maybe address what changed. So, if you think about over the course of CQ4, we have seen a pushout of the PC refresh cycle that our customers had been anticipating, we had been anticipating. And it's not like the refresh cycle won't happen. It will happen in 2025. It just been a little bit delayed. There are numerous drivers which we mentioned in our prepared remarks as to why we believe and our customers believe that the refresh cycle will happen. The average age of the PC has become pretty long in the tooth, and it is ripe for an upgrade. And as people look to keep their PCs for a number of years, they will look to ultimately future proof the hardware specs, which is why we believe that even with very modest unit volume growth, the mix improvement that will come from higher memory content in these PCs will be a positive driver in 2025. But the delay in that upgrade cycle means that our calendar '24 PC shipment forecast at the unit level for PCs at our end customers has been reduced and is now very flattish year-over-year in calendar '24, so that has been one driver. The other is that definitely the inventories that we had highlighted in the last earnings call, that we expected by spring would become healthier at our customers, that inventory and inventory reduction as well as the seasonality of CQ1, those are continuing impacts. Some impact coming from the moderation. You mentioned -- previous discussion we just had a short while ago about lumpiness of demand on the data center SSD side. So some moderation in data center SSD into CQ1 after significant bout of buying over several quarters in calendar '24. So those are the things that have impacted the near-term outlook. But I just wanted to mention that most of the impact is limited to consumer-oriented segments, and the trajectory of demand in the data center continues to be very robust. Our own data center segment view of the overall revenue trajectory through fiscal '25, calendar '25 remains in a very solid trajectory. You have seen our F Q1 results as well that we highlighted. So it's mainly the consumer-oriented segments and some very temporary moderation of the data center SSD, which we expect will pick up again in a couple of months. And so if you think about just these consumer-oriented segments, we do expect that by spring time, the inventories will be much healthier. And then we are back to shipment growth because right now, we are shipping to these customers at a rate that is lower than their ship out because they are consuming DRAM and NAND at a faster rate than they're purchasing from us and from the industry. So that's the effect of the inventory that we expect will be in a much healthier place by spring and then a resumption of shipments and growth in shipments for the second half of the fiscal year and then things will be much better. And overall, DRAM will be continuing to be in a much healthier place. The supply is tight. HBM continues to pressure non-HBM availability of supply. So a large part of the issue is NAND related, and we have outlined the actions we are taking on the supply there to decisively bring our supply and balance with the demand.
Chris Caso: That's helpful. Thank you. I mean just a follow-up to that. In terms of -- and I think you've been very clear on what's going on with NAND. But with DRAM, and I guess, this lower bit demand assumption overall for Q2. How much of that is DRAM versus NAND? And with the mid-teens growth that you now have for DRAM for the year, how back end loaded is that given what you're seeing in Q1? Because, I guess, you really weren't specific in NAND versus DRAM bit demand for -- bit growth for Q1? Yeah.
Mark Murphy: Yeah, Chris. Just to be clear, we did say that DRAM bits would be down in Q2. We said that NAND would be down meaningfully.
Chris Caso: Okay.
Mark Murphy: Yeah. The majority of revenue decline versus the second quarter will be NAND.
Sumit Sadana: So yeah, I mean, the DRAM decline in F Q2 is largely driven by the dynamics I described on the segment side for consumer oriented segments, right? I mean the data center segment, very strong on the DRAM side, very strong. So it's really the consumer-oriented segments. And we feel that, that's -- we're going to get past a lot of that headwind in the spring timeframe. So after CQ1, things will start to improve there. So we do expect sequential increases in volume in both DRAM and NAND starting in F Q3. F Q2 is what Mark had mentioned, the sequential decline in DRAM volume, but a meaningful decline sequentially in NAND volume.
Chris Caso: Okay. Got it. Helpful clarification. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Your question, please.
Vijay Rakesh: Yeah. Hi, Mark and Sumit. Thanks for doing the call back. Just wondering on the -- as your SPM capacity, maybe goes up next year, how much is your conventional DRAM capacity coming down? And can you size the HBM capacity, how much do you think that goes up next year? I have a follow-up.
Manish Bhatia: Hi, Vijay. It's Manish. So I think we've given the data points that -- as we go towards mature yields in HBM, the trade ratio between HBM and DRAM is -- HBM3E and our conventional DRAM is at 3. So that's -- you can sort of do the math at how much of our -- as we grow our HBM share towards our natural bit share, which we expect to achieve sometime next year in calendar '25, you can do the math and determine how much of that impact will be on our conventional DRAM wafer starts because we'll -- essentially for everyone, we're going to have to have three wafer starts or -- in HBM for every one that we would have had for the same number of bits in conventional DRAM. And we are focused on being able to maintain our DRAM bit share as we go through the Atrium transition here next year. And I think our DRAM overall bit growth will be in line with the industry bit growth numbers -- demand numbers that we had talked about for calendar '25.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. And then on the CapEx side, can you talk to what's the split between HBM and conventional DRAM and NAND? Thanks.
Manish Bhatia: I don't know we're breaking it out specifically, but we have said that when you think about HBM in terms of both the capital that's specific to the HBM product, whether that's in the front-end fabs or in the specific assembly and test process and the clean room needed for new HBM capability, all of that, plus you also have the CapEx to be able to maintain the bid output as you or impacted by that trade ratio, that overall HBM is the largest portion of our CapEx for this fiscal year. Other areas that we're focused on are in facilities in construction and also some in back end. As you know, we have a facility that we're investing in, in India and others, so...
Mark Murphy: Vijay, NAND is -- clearly, we've mentioned we've cut CapEx in NAND. It's lower. The percent spend on NAND is lower than the percent of the business revenue. So it's a much lower spend. And the DRAM spend, as Manish mentioned, is largely driven by this trade ratio effect and HBM requirements there.
Vijay Rakesh: That’s excellent (ph). Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin from Stifel. Your question, please.
Brian Chin: Hi, there. Good afternoon. Thanks for letting us ask a few questions. Maybe first on the NAND side. We've heard of at least one other NAND supply reducing wafer starts, maybe kind of similar as to how you've disclosed today. But back in early 2023, some of the larger suppliers were slow to take actions to reduce wafer inputs. Do you expect maybe some of these other suppliers to follow more quickly this time, similar actions or lag like they did previously?
Sumit Sadana: Difficult for us to project or predict what others would do. We'd rather not speculate other activities. What we can say is, how we look at the market and the decisive actions we are taking immediately. And we feel like these things will at least help Micron's view of supply growth coming from us and our view of demand growth to be aligned, so that's what we are doing.
Brian Chin: Okay. Thanks. And then on the DRAM side, I don't think it was that many quarters ago that your DDR5 bit shipments crossed over DDR4. And now you're indicating only 10% or so of your global DRAM sales will be from DDR4 for the next several quarters through fiscal year-end, that's actually a lot lower ratio than I would have expected. Does this shipment mix actually closely match your internal production mix? Meaning that it's not just you're holding back inventory, but structurally, you've shifted a high majority of your DRAM production to DDR5, HBM specialty, those types of products.
Sumit Sadana: Yeah. I mean that's correct. I mean we do have -- I mean, just for clarity, DDR4 and LP4, right, that's in that 10% approximately range of revenue for the remainder of fiscal year. And we do have long life cycle products that we support for the different segments like industrial, automotive, over time with more defense, aerospace, etc., that will have some of this long cycle effect. However, as our overall revenue grows, the mix of these products will remain at a very contained level. We have shifted a lot of our mix to these leading edge products, and our leading edge nodes are very constrained. So we are dedicating a lot of capacity to a very fast ramp of HBM, and you're seeing the results from that. And even as we continue to increase our view of calendar '25 time of HBM, we are maintaining our view of getting to our natural share in the second half of calendar '25. So you're seeing that a lot of mix shift is happening. And I spoke about the LP leadership in the data center, DDR leadership and the growth that is taking place. And even the growth in LP5 on the flagship smartphone side that we are supporting. So yeah, definitely, that shift is very meaningful.
Brian Chin: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton from Needham & Company. Your question, please.
Quinn Bolton: Hey, Mark. I just wanted to come back to your comment on the NAND. And I think you said that NAND would account for most of the sequential decline. I mean if that's right, it could be down 30% plus. So I just want to make sure I heard you right that, that was indeed what you said? And then I got a follow-up on the consumer-facing business.
Mark Murphy: Yeah. I -- it's the majority of the revenue decline versus second quarter sequentially.
Quinn Bolton: Okay. Thank you. And then just -- you talked about the high inventory levels last quarter. It sounds like you thought you might have made some progress through fiscal Q1. Just wondering if you might be able to sort of quantify how much is left? Can you give us any sense on, are you looking to reduce a week or two weeks in -- through the spring? And from where you started last quarter, I assume most of that inventory reduction is happening in the second quarter that you probably didn't get through that much in fiscal Q1, but just wondering if you might be able to sort of from where you started, how much have you gotten through? And how much is left maybe on a percentage basis, if you don't want to talk on a week's basis?
Mark Murphy: Are you talking overall inventories, Quinn?
Quinn Bolton: Yeah. Just mostly on the consumer-facing business that seems to be kind of driving most of that sequential decline into fiscal Q2.
Mark Murphy: Yeah. So we didn't break down inventories by market. We did make progress in the first quarter, as you've noted. DIO was down below 150 days overall. But we have a volume related decline or deterioration in DIO in the second quarter. So on a -- we'll have DIO go up first to second quarter, we'll have absolute inventory dollars go up. And again, this is a volume driven phenomenon. And then from there, in part due to the continued data center strength, the resumption of data center SSD volume growth and the refresh cycle and content driven growth in consumer and consumer-related markets. We do see our inventories drawing down through the year, both in NAND and DRAM. Now in DRAM, we will need our leading-edge inventories that we have now just to be able to supply the market we see. So we're going to on our forecast today, and total DRAM inventories below our target levels by end of fiscal [indiscernible].
Quinn Bolton: Sorry, Mark. I guess my question was more inventory at the customers rather than on your balance sheet, sort of, you said your current shipping low consumption in Q2. I guess maybe the other way is, it sounds like you think you start shipping in line with consumption again by Q3?
Mark Murphy: Yeah. I thought that was covered earlier on that we see inventories getting to a better place in the spring. So -- but as Sumit mentioned, we're shipping in less than they're shipping out or consuming. So we have confidence that both in their demand and related our inventory consumption through fiscal year '25 beyond our second quarter.
Quinn Bolton: Yeah. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks. Mark, I think, I just want to clarify that I heard what you said. So you -- in terms of your DRAM bit shipments, you're sort of saying that they're going to be in line with the mid-teens for calendar '25. Is that right? Number one. And then number two, are you going to under-ship the market? Because I think you said demand is growing low doubles, which you took that down, but I would think you're going to under-ship that.
Mark Murphy: We said that industry -- well, we said industry bit supply -- our industry bit demand mid-teens. We gave -- we said with DRAM -- yeah, for DRAM. And when we've said that volumes will be down in the second quarter and expect to ship in-line with the industry.
Timothy Arcuri: For the year -- full year?
Mark Murphy: For the year.
Timothy Arcuri: Yeah. Okay. And then what about NAND? I mean NAND demand is up low doubles, but I would guess you're going to under-ship that for the year. Is that fair?
Sumit Sadana: No. I mean, for the year, we expect to have stable bit share in calendar '24 and '25. Across both DRAM and NAND, generally, that is true across '24 and '25. We expect to have relatively stable. Some noise here and there, but relatively stable bit share across both of those years.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay. So you'll ship -- your NAND shipments are going to be up like close to that low double-digit demand. Is that fair?
Mark Murphy: Yes.
Timothy Arcuri: All right.
Mark Murphy: There's always the calendar versus fiscal, right? I just want to be careful because that skews things somewhat, but we have a four month skew between calendar and fiscal year. So that changes things.
Timothy Arcuri: Yeah. But I mean, I was talking calendar-to-calendar. So I'm just trying to just say in the calendar year because you're giving us a demand number for calendar year. So I'm saying in that calendar year, you're going to ship in-line roughly for both DRAM and NAND.
Mark Murphy: Yeah. That's right.
Timothy Arcuri: Got it. Okay. All right. I’ll let somebody else ask.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Your question, please.
Hadi Orabi: Hey, guys. This is Hadi for Chris. I would like to clarify your comments regarding HBM and the volume and pricing agreements being locked in. Are these agreements cancelable? If so, I wonder under what conditions can customers cancel? I'm wondering if there are specific like duration limits or restrictions in place? Thank you.
Sumit Sadana: Yeah. I mean, these are agreements that relates to amount of bits and cubes of HBM that our customers are going to purchase 8-high versus 12-high by quarter with pricing associated with them. And once we get into certain relatively lengthy lead times, then we get firm orders because of these lead times that we build with and ship for. And given the environment in the industry, more of the discussion is around chasing more supply because we have an extraordinarily strong product that customers want more of, and we are ramping as fast as possible -- fast as humanly possible to be able to grow our share to the targets that we have outlined. And so yes, customers can cancel if it is not in that firm time for the purchase order. If it is beyond that time line, yes, customers can make changes, but there's a fairly lengthy time line when based on very long lead times that they have to place from purchase orders for. And customers have been doing that with consistency, and that's what gives us the confidence for a very strong ramp ahead.
Hadi Orabi: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.
Toshiya Hari: Hi. Thank you for taking the follow-up here. I had one question on HBM and how to think about the ramp going forward on a quarterly basis. You guys don't report HBM revenue. So I'm guessing a little bit here. But based on everything you've said over the past couple of quarters, we're sort of estimating you did, I don't know, $800 million, $900 million in revenue in the quarter. I assume it's going to be up again nicely this quarter. So when I think about the starting point this quarter and then the comments you made on calendar '25 TAM and your market share goals, it feels like the trajectory kind of flattens out from here, still up, but flatter. I'm curious, am I thinking about it the right way? And if so, what are some of the constraints? Is it space? Is it TSP capacity both? And when should we expect your supply side -- your capacity to increase nicely. Is it tied to the Taiwan facility? Any insights there would be really helpful. Thank you.
Sumit Sadana: I'll give you a couple of opening comments, and then I'll pass it over to Manish to talk about the second half of your question that relates to space and so on. Yes, we did give you the expectation of how we would ramp and how we get to this market share that is roughly equivalent to our DRAM supply share, which is in the low-20s and get there in the calendar second half with a view that there is going to be a $30 billion plus TAM on HBM for calendar '25, right? So that's sort of the outline we have given you. Now you're right, we don't report HBM numbers. We may choose to provide some data points in the future, but we haven't done so, except for that over $100 million point that we had mentioned when we first crossed that. The numbers that you outlined for F Q1 are a little bit high. But nonetheless, I think there is going to be still a pretty robust ramp occurring on the HBM revenue for us to hit the targets that we have outlined based on the TAM expectation and the growth of TAM on a quarterly basis that we had mentioned. And with that, I'll just pass it on to Manish to answer the second half of your question.
Manish Bhatia: Yeah, Toshiya. So the -- we're pleased with how the 8-high ramp has gone. We've made some comments on the prior call about how that had exceeded our expectations in the last quarter, and we're continuing to have a strong ramp forward here. We think that the process choices we've made are -- this demonstrates that we have a scalable process and that it's going to be able -- we're going to be able to transition it to the 12-high as we move -- transition our capacity towards that ramp, which will become increasingly important as we go through calendar year '25. And really, it's just a ramp. It's just a ramp of adding capacity across many different dimensions and it's just gradually happening over time as we are installing new equipment and qualifying that new equipment and growing our capacity week-over-week as we move towards that goal. Keep in mind, we had zero -- we had no product in HBM3 and very limited production in HBM2E on a process that was quite a bit different than what we have right now in HBM3. So we really are starting from a very low point as we were beginning this HBM3E ramp and are continuing to grow, and we're adding capacity gradually as we went through this year and continuing into next year. So as Sumit said, I think we would expect that as we go through the year and as we get to the 12-high being a larger portion of our mix through the year, you will still see solid revenue growth as we're going quarter-over-quarter through the rest of fiscal '25 and even as we go through calendar year '25.
Toshiya Hari: That’s really helpful. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session as well as today's program. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2024 Q4  (2024-09-25 16:30:00) =====

Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Satya. Good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered a strong finish to fiscal year 2024, with fiscal Q4 revenue at the high end of our guidance range and gross margins and EPS above the high end of our guidance ranges. In fiscal Q4, we achieved record-high revenues in NAND and in our storage business unit. Micron's fiscal 2024 revenue grew over 60%. We expanded company gross margins by over 30 percentage points and achieved revenue records in data center and in automotive. I am thankful to all our Micron team members for their focus and execution, which made these results possible. We are entering fiscal 2025 with the strongest competitive positioning in Micron's history. We have leadership 1-beta DRAM and G8 and G9 NAND process technology, and leadership products across our end markets. Robust data center demand is exceeding our leading-edge node supply and is driving overall healthy supply-demand dynamics. As we move through calendar 2025, we expect a broadening of demand drivers, complementing strong demand in the data center. We are making investments to support AI-driven demand and our manufacturing network is well positioned to execute on these opportunities. We look forward to delivering a substantial revenue record with significantly improved profitability in fiscal 2025, beginning with our guidance for record quarterly revenue in fiscal Q1. Micron is ramping production of the industry's most advanced technology nodes in both DRAM and NAND. Our 1-beta DRAM and G8 and G9 NAND nodes are ramping in high volume and will become an increasing portion of our mix through fiscal 2025. As a reminder, our G8 NAND node refers to our 232-layer NAND technology node. Our 1-gamma DRAM pilot production using extreme ultraviolet lithography is progressing well, and we are on track for volume production in calendar 2025. We delivered fiscal 2024 DRAM front-end cost reductions at the high end of the outlook provided at the beginning of the year and NAND cost reductions were consistent with our forecast. We expect fiscal 2025 DRAM front-end cost reductions excluding HBM to be in the mid-to-high single-digit percentage range. We expect fiscal 2025 NAND cost reductions to be in the low-to-mid teens percentage range. We continue to make progress on the construction for our new fab in Idaho and are working with state and federal agencies on the permitting process for our New York site. Construction is underway on our India assembly and test facility, as well as our China Xi'an back-end expansion. We are continuously assessing opportunities to manage our manufacturing footprint in a capital-efficient manner. Consistent with this strategy, we announced the acquisition of an LCD factory in Taiwan that will be converted to enable DRAM production testing. Micron's proprietary and vertically integrated testing capabilities provide competitive differentiation and enable us to provide high-quality products to our customers. Now turning to our end markets. Memory is essential to extend the frontier of AI capability. Multiple vectors will drive AI memory demand over the coming years. Growing model sizes and input token requirements, multimodality, multiagent solutions, continuous training, and the proliferation of inference workloads from cloud to the edge. Micron is focused on translating the opportunities from AI demand into value captured for all our stakeholders. Demand from data center customers continues to be strong and customer inventory levels are healthy. Industry server unit shipments are expected to grow in the mid-to-high single-digit percentage range in calendar 2024, driven by strong growth for AI servers as well as low single-digit percentage range growth for traditional servers. We expect traditional server demand to benefit from a refresh cycle as a single latest-generation traditional server can replace multiple older-generation servers to provide valuable space, power and performance improvements to improve data center efficiency. We see increasing DRAM and NAND content both in traditional as well as AI servers. Our mix of data center revenue reached a record level in fiscal 2024 and we expect will grow significantly from here in fiscal 2025. Micron is well positioned in the data center with our portfolio of HBM, high-capacity D5 and LP5 solutions, and data center SSD products. We expect each of these three product categories to deliver multiple billions of dollars in revenue in fiscal 2025. In HBM, we are making excellent progress on our yield and output capability. In fiscal Q4, we delivered on our expected volumes and achieved our objective of several hundred millions of dollars in revenue from HBM in fiscal year 2024. Even as our DRAM gross margins improved, our fiscal Q4 HBM gross margins were accretive to both company and DRAM gross margins, indicative of our solid HBM yield ramp. We expect to achieve HBM market share commensurate with our overall DRAM market share sometime in calendar 2025. We expect the HBM TAM to grow from approximately $4 billion in calendar 2023 to over $25 billion in calendar 2025. As a percent of overall industry DRAM bits, we expect HBM to grow from 1.5% in calendar 2023 to around 6% in calendar 2025. We have a robust roadmap for HBM and are confident we will maintain our time-to-market, technology and power efficiency leadership with HBM4 and HBM4E. During the quarter, Micron started shipments of production-capable HBM3E 12-high 36GB units to key industry partners to enable qualifications across the AI ecosystem. Remarkably, Micron's HBM3E 12-high 36GB delivers 20% lower power consumption than our competitors' HBM3E 8-high 24GB solutions while providing 50% higher DRAM capacity. We expect to ramp our HBM3E 12-high output in early calendar 2025 and increase the 12-high mix in our shipments throughout 2025. As we have said before, our HBM is sold out for calendar 2024 and 2025, with pricing already determined for this time frame. In calendar 2025 and 2026, we will have a more diversified HBM revenue profile as we have won business across a broad range of HBM customers with our industry-leading HBM3E solution. We see strong demand for our high-capacity D5 and LP5 solutions. We are seeing increasing adoption of our high-capacity mono-die-based 128GB D5 DIMM products. We are leveraging our innovative, industry-leading LP5 solutions to pioneer the adoption of low-power DRAM for servers in the data center. Micron's LP5 is specifically designed with data center and AI applications in mind, offering unique features for enhanced reliability, availability and serviceability or RAS in a server platform. We are focused on LPDDR design innovation to optimize the capacity, power and system reliability requirements of AI server infrastructure. Data center SSD demand continues to be driven by strong growth in AI as well as a recovery in traditional compute and storage. Our strategy to use greater levels of vertical integration, including Micron-designed controllers and firmware has resulted in a data center SSD portfolio that addresses customer requirements for a robust set of features and functionality, competitive total cost of ownership and industry-leading performance and quality. We have gained substantial share in data center SSDs as a result. We achieved a quarterly revenue record with over a billion dollars in revenue in data center SSDs in fiscal Q4, and our fiscal 2024 data center SSD revenues more than tripled from a year ago. Turning to PC. As discussed in our last earnings call, PC customers have built inventories due to the rising memory price trajectory, anticipated growth in AI PCs as well as an expectation of tight supply caused by an increasing portion of production output being dedicated to meeting the growing data center demand. As sell through of PCs continues at a steady pace with a seasonal increase in the second half of calendar 2024, we expect healthier inventories at PC OEMs by spring 2025. PC unit volumes remain on track to grow in the low single-digit range for calendar 2024. We expect unit growth to continue in 2025 and accelerate into the second half of calendar 2025, as the PC replacement cycle gathers momentum with the rollout of next-gen-AI PCs, end of support for Windows 10 and the launch of Windows 12. The PC market is in the early stages of a transformation and we expect a significant shift towards AI-driven functionalities that promise to enhance user experiences and productivity. AI PCs require a higher capacity of memory and storage. As an example, leading PC OEMs have recently announced AI-enabled PCs with a minimum of 16GB of DRAM for the value segment and between 32GB to 64GB for the mid and premium segments, versus an average content across all PCs of around 12GB last year. Micron is well positioned to support the growth of AI PCs with our portfolio of client LPDRAM, DRAM and SSD products. Our low-power compression attached memory module or LPCAMM2 product has had multiple design wins at leading PC OEMs. These modules offer all the benefits of low-power DRAM in an upgradable form factor. Compared to the alternative modular D5 based solutions, LPCAMM2 provides up to 60% lower power and up to 70% better performance along with 60% space savings. Our 3500 client SSD is qualified at all the major PC OEMs and provides the power-performance enhancements needed for AI workloads. Turning to mobile. Smartphone customer inventory dynamics are evolving in a manner somewhat similar to that of PC customers. Smartphone unit volumes in calendar 2024 are on track to grow in the low-to-mid single-digit percentage range and we expect unit growth to continue in 2025. Smartphone OEMs are seeking to differentiate their devices by incorporating more AI features such as personalized recommendations, improved camera functionalities and smarter voice assistants. Recently, leading Android smartphone OEMs have announced AI-enabled smartphones with 12GB to 16GB of DRAM, versus an average of 8GB in flagship phones last year. Micron is well positioned to support the growth of AI smartphones with our leading-edge memory and storage products. During the quarter, we extended our product leadership with the first customer qualification of our second-generation 1-beta based LP5X DRAM and second-generation of G8 NAND UFS 4.0 products. In the automotive market, infotainment and ADAS are driving long-term memory and storage content growth. For the fourth consecutive year, Micron achieved a fiscal year record for automotive revenue in 2024. Micron has built an industry-leading portfolio of automotive-grade DRAM and NAND products that provide best-in-class solutions for these high growth applications leveraging our technology and product leadership, top quality rankings, and close customer collaborations. During the quarter, we achieved qualification of our 1-beta based 16Gb LP5 with 9.6 Gbps speed for the automotive market, which will support the increased performance requirements driven by AI both in the digital cockpit and ADAS. The automotive industry continues to adjust the mix of EV, hybrid and traditional vehicles to meet evolving customer demand. As auto customer inventories adjust to this new mix, we expect a resumption in our automotive growth in the second half of fiscal 2025. Now, turning to our market outlook. Calendar 2024 DRAM industry demand outlook has improved, driven by strength in data center servers, and growth in the other market segments has performed consistent with our prior market commentary. Hence, we have upgraded our expectation for calendar 2024 industry DRAM bit demand growth to now be in the high-teens percentage range. Our expectation for calendar 2024 industry NAND bit demand growth remains in the mid-teens percentage range. In calendar 2025, we expect both DRAM and NAND industry bit demand growth to be around the mid-teens percentage range. Turning to supply. Constructive industry conditions will help drive the considerable improvements in profitability and ROI that are needed to enable the investments required to support future growth. Due to CapEx and supply reduction actions taken across the industry in 2023, we expect industry wafer capacity in both DRAM and NAND in 2024 to be below 2022 peak levels, and for NAND meaningfully so. This factor combined with the increasing mix of HBM wafers is reducing DRAM supply allocated to traditional products and contributing to the healthy industry supply-demand environment that we expect for DRAM in calendar 2025. Given the significant reduction in industry wafer capacity in NAND and the ongoing low NAND CapEx environment, we also expect a healthy industry supply-demand environment for NAND in calendar 2025. NAND technology transitions generally provide more growth in annualized bits per wafer compared to the NAND bit demand CAGR expectation of high teens. Consequently, we anticipate longer periods between industry technology transitions and moderating capital investment over time to align industry supply with demand. This can reduce both R&D expense growth and capital intensity in NAND over time, which can contribute to the improved financial health of the NAND industry. Micron invested $8.1 billion in CapEx in fiscal 2024. We expect fiscal 2025 CapEx to be meaningfully higher and at around the mid-30s percentage range of revenue based on our current CapEx and revenue expectations. The growth in both greenfield fab construction and HBM CapEx investments is projected to make up the overwhelming majority of the year-over-year CapEx increase. As a reminder, our investments in facility and construction in Idaho and New York will support our long-term demand outlook for DRAM and will not contribute to bit supply in fiscal 2025 and 2026. Micron will continue to exercise supply and CapEx discipline and focus on improving profitability, including walking away from less profitable business, while still maintaining our overall bit market share for DRAM and NAND. I will now turn it over to Mark for our financial results and outlook.
Mark Murphy: Thanks, Sanjay, and good afternoon, everyone. In fiscal Q4, Micron delivered revenue at the high end of the guidance range and gross margin and EPS above the high end of the guidance ranges. We are exiting the fiscal year with excellent momentum, having expanded our industry-leading product portfolio, executed well on pricing, and improved our financial performance significantly from the start of the year. Total fiscal Q4 revenue was approximately $7.8 billion, up 14% sequentially and up 93% year-over-year. Fiscal 2024 total revenue was $25.1 billion, up 62% year-over-year. Fiscal Q4 DRAM revenue was $5.3 billion, up 93% year-over-year and represented 69% of total revenue. Sequentially, DRAM revenue increased 14%, with flattish bit shipments and prices increasing in the mid-teens percentage range. For the fiscal year, DRAM revenue increased 60% year-over-year to $17.6 billion, representing 70% of total revenue. Fiscal Q4 NAND revenue was $2.4 billion, up 96% year-over-year, and represented 31% of Micron's total revenue. NAND revenue increased 15% sequentially, with bit shipments increasing in the high single-digit percentage range and prices increasing in the high single-digit percentage range. Fiscal Q4 NAND revenue was a new quarterly record for Micron. For the fiscal year, NAND revenue increased 72% year-over-year to $7.2 billion, representing 29% of total revenue. Now turning to revenue by business unit. Compute and Networking Business Unit revenue was $3 billion, up 17% sequentially. Data center server DRAM achieved a quarterly revenue record in fiscal Q4, driven by strong demand for high-capacity solutions as well as our continued ramp of HBM. Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $1.9 billion, up 18% sequentially driven by seasonal product ramps. Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $1.7 billion, up 24% sequentially and led by data center SSD, which reached a quarterly revenue record. We achieved record-high revenue for fiscal year 2024 for our NAND storage business. Embedded Business Unit revenue was $1.2 billion, down 9% sequentially. In fiscal 2024, the automotive segment achieved a new fiscal year revenue record for the fourth consecutive year. The consolidated gross margin for fiscal Q4 was 36.5%, improving over eight percentage points sequentially. Higher pricing and improved product mix were the key drivers of the stronger profitability. For the fiscal year, consolidated gross margin was 23.7%, up over 31 percentage points year-over-year. Operating expenses in fiscal Q4 were $1.08 billion, up $105 million sequentially due to an increase in R&D program expenses. For the fiscal year, operating expenses were $4 billion, up 11% year-over-year. The increase in fiscal 2024 operating expenses was primarily driven by an increase in R&D investments and reinstatement of short-term incentive compensation. We generated operating income of $1.7 billion in fiscal Q4, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 23%, which was up nine percentage points sequentially and up 53 percentage points from the year-ago quarter. Fiscal 2024 operating income was $1.9 billion, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 8%, which was up 39 percentage points year-over-year. Fiscal Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $3.7 billion, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 48%, up five percentage points sequentially and up 30 percentage points from the year-ago quarter. Fiscal 2024 EBITDA was $9.7 billion, resulting in an EBITDA margin of over 38%, which was up 20 percentage points year-over-year. Fiscal Q4 taxes were $387 million and higher than our guide, largely due to a shift in the jurisdictional mix of earnings. Fiscal 2024 taxes were $379 million or approximately 20% of pretax income. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in fiscal Q4 was $1.18 compared to $0.62 per share in the prior quarter and a loss per share of $1.07 in the year-ago quarter. Fiscal Q4 non-GAAP EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance range, driven by better pricing and profitability. Fiscal 2024 non-GAAP EPS was $1.30. Turning to cash flows and capital spending, our operating cash flows were $3.4 billion in fiscal Q4, representing 44% of revenue. For the fiscal year, we generated $8.5 billion of operating cash flows, representing 34% of revenue. Capital expenditures were $3.1 billion during the quarter. CapEx totaled $8.1 billion for the fiscal year, up from $7 billion in fiscal 2023. We generated $323 million of free cash flow for the quarter and $386 million for the fiscal year. As announced in early August, we determined that share repurchases may resume in light of improved conditions. As such, with our return to free cash flow, reduced leverage and long-term positive outlook, we saw an opportunity to repurchase shares in the quarter. In fiscal Q4, we repurchased $300 million or 3.2 million shares at an average price of $93.07 per share. Micron's fiscal Q4 ending inventory was $8.9 billion or 158 days, up three days from the prior quarter. Micron continues to exercise pricing discipline and expects a healthy supply-demand environment in the industry in fiscal 2025. We intend to draw down our inventory to support our revenue growth in fiscal 2025. On the balance sheet, we held $9.2 billion of cash and investments at quarter-end and maintained near $11.7 billion of liquidity when including our untapped credit facility. We ended the quarter with $13.4 billion in total debt, low net leverage and a weighted average maturity on our debt of 2031. We are committed to further strengthening our balance sheet and sustaining our investment-grade credit rating. Now turning to our outlook for the fiscal first quarter. Fiscal Q1 gross margin is projected to improve sequentially primarily on better pricing and portfolio mix. Recall that, in fiscal Q4, HBM remained accretive to both DRAM and overall company gross margins. We project changes in our portfolio mix to continue to be an important and favorable contributor to gross margins over time. We forecast operating expenses to be flat to slightly up in the fiscal first quarter compared to fiscal fourth quarter levels. For the full fiscal year 2025, we see operating expenses growing by a mid-teens percentage versus fiscal 2024. Growth in operating expenses is planned to be second half weighted, as we ramp necessary R&D program investments, including for HBM, to capture the substantial growth opportunity ahead. For fiscal Q1 and fiscal 2025, we estimate our non-GAAP tax rate to be in the mid-teens percentage range. We project days of inventory outstanding to decline in fiscal 2025 and for DIO to approach our target by the end of fiscal 2025. In fiscal Q1, we forecast capital expenditures to increase sequentially to approximately $3.5 billion. As Sanjay mentioned, we expect fiscal 2025 CapEx to be around mid-30s percentage range of revenue based on our current CapEx and revenue expectations. We remain circumspect with all capital spending and disciplined with WFE investments in order to grow bit supply in line with industry demand. With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for fiscal Q1 is as follows. We expect revenue to be $8.7 billion plus or minus $200 million. Gross margin to be in the range of 39.5% plus or minus 100 basis points and operating expenses to be approximately $1.085 billion plus or minus $15 million. As mentioned, we expect the fiscal Q1 tax rate to be in the mid-teens percentage range. Based on a share count of approximately 1.14 billion shares, we expect EPS to be $1.74 per share plus or minus $0.08. In closing, we remain focused on investing in a disciplined manner to support our growth and maintain stable bit share in DRAM and NAND. Micron is well positioned to deliver record revenue as well as significantly improved profitability and free cash flow in fiscal 2025. I will now turn it back over to Sanjay.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Mark. Fiscal 2024 was a year of many records as we discussed earlier and I expect fiscal 2025 to be even better. With the advent of AI, we are in the most exciting period that I have seen for memory and storage in my career. Micron's memory and storage innovations are enabling tremendous breakthroughs, transforming how the world uses information to enrich life for all. Micron has sustained multiple generations of technology leadership in DRAM and NAND. Our unique culture and our industry-leading product portfolio, combined with our world-class manufacturing execution and quality are enabling us to deliver differentiated, high-value solutions across end markets. This has made us the partner of choice for our customers as they plan their long-term roadmaps and our momentum lays the foundation for an exciting fiscal 2025. Thank you for joining us today. We will now open for questions.
Operator: Certainly. Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question please.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Mark, I guess my first question is, some of the assumptions in guidance. I think you've been saying kind of on the conference circuit that bits would be pretty flat in fiscal Q1 for both DRAM and NAND. Is that what you're still assuming so that most of the increase in the revenue is basically pricing? Is that correct?
Mark Murphy: Tim, what we see now and we had provided a slight update in August, but we now see that DRAM bits, we expect to be up somewhat higher than what we had said before. We had said before they were going to be flat and then we revised that to flat to slightly up and in this latest guide, we now view DRAM to be up somewhat higher from that. NAND bits, we expect to be sequentially flattish. Keep in mind that our guide also contemplates a healthy supply-demand environment and an increasingly favorable mix in the business with HBM, high-capacity DIMMs, LP, data center SSD. So we see stronger data center demand and we had indicated that it was robust and that's been favorable. And then we're just executing well on our product road maps, our product execution, our overall manufacturing execution.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks, Mark. And then just one last thing. You had said that HBM revenue last quarter in May was a little over $100 million. Can you give us the number in August? Was it -- it looks like it was $300 million to $350 million something like that. Is that about right for your HBM revenue in fiscal Q4?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So we are not disclosing a specific revenue for FQ4. We have said earlier that we will have several hundred million dollars of revenue in fiscal year '24 and we achieved that objective. And really very proud of all the execution from our team in terms of putting in place the capacity, managing the yield ramp successfully to our goals, and of course, continue to deliver a strong product to our customer base. So not providing -- we're not going to be providing specifics on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But keep in mind, yes, we delivered several hundred million dollars of revenue in fiscal year '24 and we look forward to delivering multiple billions of dollars of revenue of HBM in fiscal year '25.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay. Thank you, Sanjay.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question please.
C.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question on gross margins. You guided up a robust 300 basis points. I was hoping you could spend a little bit of time kind of walking us through what's driving that? How much is from like-for-like DRAM ASP increases, mix, HBM yield improvements and cost downs. And I guess, as you kind of walk through that, can you give us a flavor of how to think about those drivers beyond the November quarter?
Mark Murphy: So C.J., in the fourth or first quarter, as we look at that margin expansion, it's similar to the themes we've talked about before. The supply-demand environment is healthy. So we're seeing that play through on -- in pricing. We're also seeing the execution of our product road map and the ramp of the higher-value products and that's contributing. On costs, we are doing well on cost downs. However, in the first quarter because of the mix with HBM, we are going to see DRAM costs go up slightly. And that's so as we look forward into the first quarter, things are coming together as we had hoped, tied at the leading edge, good supply demand, favorable pricing environment and certainly favorable mix and that becoming a more important part of the business and good cost execution.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. And then I guess maybe as a follow-up, you've reiterated your CapEx outlook, but obviously, the end market environment has changed a bit in the last three months. So curious if you've changed your prioritization of CapEx at all? Obviously, you talked about a focus on shelves and HBM. Any other change in terms of your spending?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Not really. We don't have any other change. I mean again continuing to focus our CapEx on HBM investment, which as you know, is a high-value solution and product tends to be accretive to the margins. And of course, long-term construction CapEx, and that is -- the construction CapEx that is targeted for longer term bit growth for the second -- latter part of this decade.
C.J. Muse: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Your question please.
Krish Sankar: Yes, I have two questions. One, Sanjay, your AI GPU customers are moving to a one-year cadence of your products. And it looks like the HBM road map is also moving to that 12 months from a prior 18-month cadence. Do you think that this puts you and your peers at a yield disadvantage, i.e., in other words, as HBM3E yield and gross margin improves, you have to migrate to HBM4 and that new node might come at a lower yield. So I'm just kind of curious how to think about that cadence of HBM progression and how that impacts yield and gross margin? And then I had a quick follow-up.
Sanjay Mehrotra: As we mentioned, we are doing well with respect to our goals on HBM3E yields with 8 high. And in '25, of course, we will be increased -- beginning our output in early 2025 with 12 high. And of course, 12 high will be going through its own yield ramp and 12 high will be ramping through our calendar year '25 and HBM4 will be a 2026 product. And like any other new product, of course, there are in the early stages, always ramp-up of yield involved. But we are very pleased with the technical expertise that we have, manufacturing expertise and doing really quite well in terms of continuing to ramp up the yield and the quality of our products. And at the end of the day, you know, that cadence of -- our customers' cadence moving faster only benefits those who have the best product and technology because they are the ones who are able to work with the customers at the pace that they need. And we are with our HBM3E, which has demonstrated clear leadership in performance, in power and overall product feature set for our customers, we absolutely plan to maintain that leadership going forward with our road map from 8 high to 12 high of HBM3E and HBM4 and 4E in the future years. Along with our expertise in manufacturing, that should play to our strength in the time frame ahead. And we work very closely with our customers.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Very helpful.
Sanjay Mehrotra: We work very, very closely with our customers to understand their cadence, to understand their requirements and make sure that our road map, both from technology, product and manufacturing capabilities is aligned well with their requirements.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Thanks a lot for that Sanjay. Super helpful color. And a quick follow-up for Mark on inventory. I understand you're going to draw that down in FY'25. But just in the last quarter, it went up, any color on where that inventory level is going up? Is that within PCs? Is it mobile DRAM? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks a lot.
Mark Murphy: Sure. We were clear about this in the August conferences that we were seeing -- while we were seeing robust data center demand, we were seeing some customers had -- were buying ahead in anticipation of price increases, the rollout of AI-related devices and just surety of supply, given that leading edge is tight. So we did see some inventory build and we communicated that inventories would remain elevated going into FY'25. So as what you see, so our days did go up. We continue to be prudent with our supply and walking away from less profitable business. We do expect the environment, supply-demand environment to be constructive for improved profitability in '25. And given the tight leading-edge nodes and our outlook, we're going to need these inventories to bridge us to when our production on tech node transitions ramps. So that's why we've given an outlook that our inventories by the end of the fiscal year, we expect to be approaching our target inventory levels. Now our volumes happen to be a bit more second half weighted of the fiscal year. So we'll see a bit shallower improvement at the first half of the fiscal year and then that improvement in DIO will steepen as we move through the second half. But we're confident in our inventory outlook and definitely need these leading-edge inventories to supply the market.
Krish Sankar: Thanks, Mark.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.
Joseph Moore: Great. Thank you. In terms of your target for getting to HBM market share that's more in line with your overall market share, can you kind of characterize how you get there? Do you anticipate that it's still a supply-constrained environment for everybody or are we sort of more -- a little bit more balanced in the quality of the Micron product drives us through? Just what's the determinant of that market share that gets you to that level?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Well, certainly, I mean we are being responsible and disciplined in terms of managing our market share. We have industry's best HBM3E product, and it's the best product with 30% lower power with 8 high. And in fact when you go to 12 high, we are 20% lower power despite 50% increase in capacity versus others 8 high products. So we are well positioned with our product, with its performance, with this power. And that's what is really putting us in the strong position of being -- product being sold out for our '24 and '25 time frame. And when we look at HBM, we have talked about that next year, we project a TAM of $25 billion, consuming about 6%, over 6% of the industry best, in fact, a TAM of greater than $25 billion in 2025. And we are pretty confident that with our product, with our yield ramp, and with the agreement that we have in place with our customers, we will deliver sometime in 2025 get to our share to be in line with our industry share. So of course, it's limited at this point by our production ramp, but we are really on a very good trajectory there. So we feel very confident with our product and with the production ramp and with share opportunities. And frankly our HBM3E product is getting premium in the industry as well versus other products. So it just puts us on a good trajectory ahead as well.
Joseph Moore: Great. Thank you. Congratulations.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your question please.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my questions. I had two as well. Sanjay, on that same topic of HBM, there is some concern about the potential for HBM oversupply in '25, let's say, there are three suppliers instead of the two that are right now. Is that something you see that there is any potential for oversupply? And let's say if you take the other scenario where there continue to be only two suppliers of NextGen HBM, do you think the third supplier could flood the market with additional DRAM, just sort of the reverse of this trade ratio argument? So just curious to hear how you think about the supply-demand dynamics for both traditional DRAM and HBM4 next year?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So we certainly assume that the third supplier will ultimately succeed in having HBM3E product as well and we'll have some share in the marketplace as well. And again, as I pointed out earlier, with the solid product that we have, our product has sold out through 2025 time frame and we are really well positioned with this product. I think the part that you have to keep in mind is that leading-edge supply, as we have mentioned here is tight. Leading-edge supply is tight because industry in '22, '23 time frame with reductions in CapEx and CapEx-efficient industry-wide transitions to the newer technology nodes, the wafer capacity has come down from the peak levels in meaningful ways. So the lower wafer capacity compared to the peak of 2022 as well as the HBM 3:1 trade ratio, these are the ones that are overall keeping the industry in a tight supply. And tight supply, not just for HBM, but also for non-HBM part of the market. So we, of course, feel very good about our own plans with HBM. And of course we always stay completely focused on managing the mix of our business between non-HBM and HBM and remaining extremely disciplined about CapEx, about our share objectives. We have shared those share objectives about HBM here. Overall, we have said we maintain our DRAM as well as NAND supply share to be stable. And this is how we look at the overall market. But when you look at the market trends, it's not just about demand trend on HBM, which is, of course, growing substantially becoming more than $25 billion market in 2025. It's also about, past spring, we see that demand for memory in smartphones and PCs as AI-enabled smartphones become bigger and bigger part of the market in the quarters and the years to come. And of course, customer inventories by spring time frame in smartphone and PCs for memory get to earlier levels, we see that to be a driver of demand as well to complement the strong data center demand. And we are looking at strong momentum, not just with HBM. We have talked about multiple billions of dollars of revenue that we target to generate in our fiscal year 2025 from high-capacity DRAM modules as well as LP memory in data center, so these are all the elements that point to strong demand trends and demand trends driven by AI in data center as well as in smartphone and PCs where more and more content is required in an environment where the leading-edge supply is today tight. So I think the opportunity is tremendous and we see healthy demand supply balance and a constructive environment for our financial performance in fiscal 2025. And that's why we say with confidence that we'll deliver a substantial revenue record in fiscal year 2025, the significant improvement in our profitability as well.
Vivek Arya: Got it. Very helpful. And maybe a quick follow-up for Mark. Mark, on the Q3 call, I think you were a little more explicit about both industry pricing and your gross margins expanding through fiscal '25. Is that still a useful construct from where you see -- from what you see today or do you think there is a scenario where gross margins or your pricing start to flatten out or even go in the other direction through fiscal '25? What is the operating assumption for fiscal '25 as you see it right now? Thank you.
Mark Murphy: Maybe just following up here to draw on Sanjay's comments. I mean we see a very positive setup in fiscal '25 and so had said substantial revenue record significantly improved profitability. The supply-demand setup is quite good. The market's leading-edge is very tight. As we've talked about, the industry wafer capacity has come down, and so in HBM, of course, is creating supply constraints in the marketplace as share bits increase. So we still see that the supply-demand environment is healthy through the year. We also are constructive for the year. We also see the trend we've talked about that our volume is increasingly moving to support higher-value ad products with our differentiated portfolio. So HBM, high-capacity DIMMs, more LP and then our NAND SSD for data center portfolio products. So I think the margin expansion through the year supported by those elements and continued good cost performance gives us confidence on a very good year.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you. I had a two-part question on the HBM business. Sanjay, you talked about you all being sold out through calendar '25. I'm curious if there's an opportunity for Micron to present upside or deliver upside to what the plan is currently for '25 or are equipment lead times such that you're essentially capped vis-a-vis what your expectations are today for HBM specifically. And then my second part is on gross margin for HBM. We all understand that the business is accretive to both the corporate average and also relative to DRAM. As you look forward into calendar '25 with volumes locked in and pricing locked in, I would assume you've got decent visibility on gross margin. Should we expect HBM gross margins to stay kind of where they are or could they move further up as long as you execute on the yield side? Thanks.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So regarding your part of your question on the upside for HBM in 2025. So again let me emphasize that we are extremely focused on delivering our goals of getting to our share in HBM to be in line with DRAM share sometime in 2025, extremely focused on continuing to ramp up our production capacity and yield ramp, which are going well according to our plan. I'm very pleased with that. So remaining focused on that. And of course if there are opportunities to be opportunistic, with any upside, of course, we will be capturing those. And those upsides always remain. And yields, we expect to get to mature yields on our HBM in fiscal year '25. Yields are always an upside opportunity, productivity of the equipment always can be an opportunity as well. So we'll manage our business responsibly and with total focus on delivering to our goals and maintaining our focus on keeping our HBM commitments to our customers coming through successfully. Now regarding your questions on gross margin being accretive, yes, we would expect our HBM business to be accretive for our fiscal year 2025. Beyond that really not providing any further details. And, yes, you are right that our volume and pricing for HBM is locked up for 2024 as well as for 2025 time frame, calendar year 2024 and calendar year 2025.
Toshiya Hari: Great. And then as a quick follow-up on DRAM industry bit growth. I think you raised your '24 outlook to high-teens and you gave a preliminary '25 outlook of mid-teens. I'm curious what's driving the decel from '24 to '25. Is the '25 number a supply-constrained number. From a demand perspective, Sanjay, you sounded pretty constructive on PCs and smartphones and obviously, the content opportunity, and you remain pretty positive on data centers. So I'm just curious what's driving the expected decel in '25. Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Yes. We'll just point, I mean, by the way, we have, in the past, talked about DRAM CAGR being mid-teens. At 2024, we have increased the outlook to high-teens based on the strength in the data center. And 2025 as we look at it just keep, in fact, mind two factors. One is we are now comparing it to the higher base of 2024, which has gone to high-teens. So that, of course, impact the percentage of the '25. And second piece is that, as we have noted, that smartphone and PC, which at the end market level are continuing to do fine. But given for the three factors that we have mentioned in our earnings call script that the customers built some inventory. The sell-in is somewhat less than their sellout in terms of memory and we have said that by spring of 2025, we expect in PCs customer inventory levels to get to healthier levels versus now and these will continue to improve. So that too plays a factor. And of course I would just like to remind you that we have pointed out that overall smartphone and PC unit growth will be occurring in 2025 and of course increasing penetration of AI phones and second half that acceleration, that growth will be obviously stronger than the first half. So all of these factors are included in our current outlook of 2025 DRAM growth being in mid-teens. And let me just point out that previously we have said that HBM, we would expect it to be greater than $20 billion opportunity in 2025. We have now said HBM is more than $25 billion opportunity in 2025. So as you know HBM has a trade ratio of 3:1, it takes three times as many wafers to produce the same bit as standard products in the technology nodes. So obviously the growth of HBM also impacts the total bit growth year-over-year in aggregate.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session as well as today's program. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-06-26 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to Micron Technology's Fiscal Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Satya Kumar, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Satya Kumar: Thank you, and welcome to Micron Technology's fiscal third quarter 2024 financial conference call.

We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results. With that, let me turn the call over to Sanjay.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Satya. Good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report that Micron delivered fiscal Q3 revenue, gross margin, and EPS, all above the high end of guidance ranges. Micron drove robust price increases as industry supply-demand conditions continued to improve. This improved pricing, combined with our strengthening product mix, resulted in increased profitability across all our end markets. In data center, rapidly growing AI demand enabled us to grow our revenue by over 50% on a sequential basis, and we grew share in high-margin AI-related product categories such as HBM, high-capacity DIMMs, and data center SSDs. Our mix of data center revenue is on track to reach record levels in fiscal 2024 and to grow significantly from there in fiscal 2025. Robust AI-driven demand for data center products is causing tightness on our leading-edge nodes. Consequently, we expect continued price increases throughout calendar 2024 despite only steady near-term demand in PCs and smartphones. As we look ahead to 2025, demand for AI PCs and AI smartphones and continued growth of AI in the data center creates a favorable setup that gives us confidence that we can deliver a substantial revenue record in fiscal 2025, with significantly improved profitability underpinned by our ongoing portfolio shift to higher-margin products. Micron is ramping the industry's most advanced technology nodes in both DRAM and NAND. Over 80% of our DRAM bit production is now on leading-edge 1-alpha and 1-beta nodes. Over 90% of our NAND bit production is on our two leading-edge NAND nodes. 1-gamma DRAM pilot production using extreme ultraviolet lithography is progressing well, and we are on track for volume production in calendar 2025. Our next-generation NAND node is on track, with high-volume production planned for calendar 2025. We experienced some operational disruptions after the recent Taiwan earthquake but were able to recover quickly, thanks to diligent efforts from Micron Taiwan team members working together with our global operations teams. Despite impacts from the earthquake, we now expect our fiscal 2024 DRAM front-end cost reductions, excluding HBM, to be in the high single-digit percentage range. We expect our fiscal 2024 NAND front-end cost reductions to be in the low-teens percentage range. These cost reductions are supported by our industry-leading 1beta DRAM and 232-layer NAND nodes. During the quarter, Micron signed a nonbinding preliminary memorandum of terms, or PMT, with the U.S. government for $6.1 billion in grants under the CHIPS and Science Act. These grants support our planned leading-edge memory manufacturing expansions in Idaho and New York. Federal and state incentives, projected power-cost advantages and R&D co-location synergies will enable Micron to achieve cost-competitive, leading-edge memory manufacturing in the United States when these projects reach efficient manufacturing scale. Fab construction in Idaho is underway, and we are working diligently to complete the regulatory and permitting processes in New York. This additional leading-edge greenfield capacity, along with continued technology transition investments in our Asia facilities, is required to meet long-term demand in the second half of this decade and beyond. These investments support our objective to maintain our current bit share over time and to grow our memory bit supply in line with long-term industry bit demand. Micron retains flexibility under the PMT to manage construction and timing of supply growth in a manner that allows us to remain responsive to market conditions. Now turning to our end markets. We are in the early innings of a multi-year race to enable artificial general intelligence, or AGI, which will revolutionize all aspects of life. Enabling AGI will require training ever-increasing model sizes with trillions of parameters and sophisticated servers for inferencing. AI will also permeate to the edge via AI PCs and AI smartphones, as well as smart automobiles and intelligent industrial systems. These trends will drive significant growth in the demand for DRAM and NAND, and we believe that Micron will be one of the biggest beneficiaries in the semiconductor industry of the multi-year growth opportunity driven by AI. Most data center customer inventories have normalized, and demand from customers continues to strengthen. PC and smartphone customers have built additional inventories due to the rising price trajectory, the anticipated growth in AI PCs and AI smartphones, as well as the expectation of tight supply as an increasing portion of DRAM and NAND output is dedicated to meeting growing data center demand. Due to expectations for continued leading-edge node tightness, we are seeing increased interest from many customers across market segments to secure 2025 long-term agreements ahead of their typical schedule. In data center, industry server unit shipments are expected to grow in the mid-to-high single digits in calendar 2024, driven by strong growth for AI servers and a return to modest growth for traditional servers. Micron is well positioned with our portfolio of HBM, D5, LP5, high-capacity DIMM, CXL, and data center SSD products. Recently, our customers have announced their long-term AI server product roadmaps, with an annual cadence of new products with significantly improved capabilities for the next several years. Micron's technology and product leadership puts us in an excellent position to support this growth. Customers continue to provide feedback that our HBM3E solution has 30% lower power consumption compared to competitors' solutions. Our HBM shipment ramp began in fiscal Q3, and we generated over $100 million in HBM3E revenue in the quarter, at margins accretive to DRAM and overall Company margins. We expect to generate several hundred million dollars of revenue from HBM in fiscal 2024 and multiple billions of dollars in revenue from HBM in fiscal 2025. We expect to achieve HBM market share commensurate with our overall DRAM market share sometime in calendar 2025. Our HBM is sold out for calendar 2024 and 2025, with pricing already contracted for the overwhelming majority of our 2025 supply. We are making significant strides toward expanding our HBM customer base in calendar 2025, as we design-in our industry-leading HBM technology with major HBM customers. We have sampled our 12-high HBM3E product and expect to ramp it into high-volume production in calendar 2025 and increase in mix throughout 2025. We have a robust roadmap for HBM and are confident we will maintain our technology leadership with HBM4 and HBM4E. Our next generations of HBM will provide further performance and capacity enhancements while we continue to evolve our industry-leading low-power innovations. We achieved full validation on our 1-beta 32 gigabit monolithic-die-based 128 gigabyte high-capacity server DIMM products and are on track to achieve several hundred million dollars of revenue from high-capacity DIMMs in the second half of fiscal 2024. Additionally, we continue to see strong interest in our industry-leading 1-beta LPDRAM in data center applications. Data center SSD is in the midst of a strong demand recovery as customers have worked through their 2023 inventory. Hyperscale demand is improving, driven primarily by AI training and inference infrastructure, and supplemented by the start of a recovery of traditional compute and storage infrastructure demand. Micron is gaining share in data center SSDs as we reach new revenue and market share records in this important product category. During the quarter, we more than tripled bit shipments of our 232-layer-based 6500 30 terabyte SSDs, which offer best-in-class performance, reliability, and endurance for AI data lake applications. We continued our leadership and innovation by becoming the first NAND vendor to supply 200-plus-layer QLC for the enterprise storage market. In PC, unit volumes remain on track to grow in the low single-digit range for calendar 2024. We are optimistic that the planned Windows 10 end-of-life in 2025, the launch of Windows 12, and the introduction of a new generation of AI PCs will accelerate the PC replacement cycle starting in late calendar 2024. The PC replacement cycle should gather momentum through calendar 2025 as new AI applications are rolled out. During Computex in Taiwan, we saw several announcements of next-generation chipsets and AI PCs. These devices feature high-performance neural processing unit chipsets, and we expect these devices will have 40% to 80% more DRAM content than today's average PC. Microsoft's minimum system requirement for Copilot+ PCs, such as the Surface Pro, is 16 gigabyte of DRAM. We expect next-gen AI PCs to make up a meaningful portion of total PC units in calendar 2025, growing each year until most PCs ultimately support next-gen AI PC specs. AI PCs are also likely to require higher performance and higher average capacity SSDs than traditional PCs, aligning well with our leading technology portfolio on our 232-layer NAND with our performance 3500 SSD and our industry-leading value QLC 2500 NVMe SSDs. Turning to mobile. Smartphone unit volumes in calendar 2024 remain on track to grow in the low- to mid-single-digit percentage range. Leading smartphone OEMs recently announced new AI capabilities, and we are optimistic that delivering high-quality AI experiences can accelerate the smartphone refresh cycle. Smartphones have tremendous potential for personalized AI capabilities that offer greater security and responsiveness when executed on device. Micron's leading LP5X is enabling the recent 12 gigabyte and 16 gigabyte AI phone releases at all Android Tier 1 customers, representing a 50% to 100% increase over last year's flagship models. Micron's leading mobile solutions provide the critical performance, capacity, and power efficiency needed to unlock AI capability. Our mobile DRAM and NAND solutions are now widely adopted in industry-leading flagship smartphones. In calendar Q1, we received recognition for being Number One in quality by five of the world's leading smartphone OEMs. Qualifications are on track for our second-generation 1-beta LP5X products, and we see broadening use of our 232-layer NAND, moving beyond flagship phones into high-capacity high-and mid-tier phones. Turning to auto and industrial. The automotive sector continued to experience robust demand for memory and storage, and Micron achieved a record quarter for automotive revenues. Car production volumes are returning to pre-pandemic levels, and broader adoption of intelligent digital cockpits and more advanced driver-assistance capabilities are driving content growth. We anticipate further content growth as additional intelligence, including generative AI-based technologies, is adopted in vehicles. Micron continues to be a leader in automotive with high-quality and industry-first product introductions. In the fiscal third quarter, we launched the world's first multiport Gen 4 NVMe SSD in support of next-generation centralized compute architectures. In industrial and retail consumer segments, which are a smaller part of our business, we are seeing some near-term demand uncertainty from our distribution partners and end customers. We remain confident in the long-term fundamentals and growth drivers of these businesses, especially with the increasing adoption of AI in a variety of applications. Now, turning to our market outlook. We forecast calendar 2024 bit demand growth for the industry to be in the mid-teens percentage range for both DRAM and NAND. Over the medium term, we expect industry bit demand growth CAGRs of mid-teens in DRAM and high teens in NAND. Turning to supply. We expect calendar 2024 industry supply to be below demand for both DRAM and NAND. As discussed previously, the ramp of HBM production will constrain industry supply growth in non-HBM products. Industrywide, HBM3E consumes approximately three times the wafer supply as D5 to produce a given number of bits in the same technology node. With increased performance and packaging complexity, across the industry, we expect this trade ratio for HBM4 to be even higher than the trade ratio for HBM3E. We anticipate strong HBM demand due to AI, combined with increasing silicon intensity of the HBM roadmap, to contribute to tight supply conditions for DRAM across all end markets. As the memory industry is still recovering from the challenging environment in 2023, this tight supply environment will help drive the considerable improvements in profitability and ROI that are needed to enable the investments required to support future growth. Micron's bit supply growth in fiscal 2024 remains below our demand growth for both DRAM and NAND. Micron will continue to exercise supply and CapEx discipline and focus on improving profitability while maintaining our bit market share for DRAM and NAND. We continue to project we will end fiscal 2024 with low double-digit percentage less wafer capacity in both DRAM and NAND than our peak levels in fiscal 2022. We intend to use our existing inventory to drive a portion of the bit growth supporting our revenue in fiscal 2025 to enable a more optimized use of our CapEx investments. Micron's fiscal 2024 CapEx plan will be approximately $8 billion, and WFE spending will be down year-on-year in fiscal 2024. We expect to increase our capital spending materially next year, with CapEx around mid-30%s range of revenue for fiscal 2025, which will support HBM assembly and test equipment, fab and back-end facility construction as well as technology transition investment to support demand growth. The construction CapEx in the planned Idaho and New York greenfield fabs in fiscal 2025 will be half or more of the expected increase in total CapEx. In fact, the growth in both greenfield fab construction and HBM CapEx investments, is projected to make up the overwhelming majority of the year-over-year CapEx increase. These fab construction investments are necessary to support supply growth for the latter half of this decade. This Idaho fab will not contribute to meaningful bit supply until fiscal 2027, and the New York construction CapEx is not expected to contribute to best supply growth until fiscal 2028 or later. The timing of future WFE spend in these fabs will be managed to align supply growth with expected demand growth. I will now turn it over to Mark for our financial results and outlook.
Mark Murphy: Thanks, Sanjay, and good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered strong results in fiscal Q3 with revenue, gross margin, and EPS above the high end of the guidance ranges provided in our last earnings call. Improving market conditions and strong price and cost execution drove the financial outperformance. Total fiscal Q3 revenue was $6.8 billion, up 17% sequentially and up 82% year-over-year. Fiscal Q3 DRAM revenue was approximately $4.7 billion, representing 69% of total revenue. DRAM revenue increased 13% sequentially, with bit shipments declining in the mid-single-digit percentage range and prices increasing by approximately 20%. Fiscal Q3 NAND revenue was approximately $2.1 billion, representing 30% of Micron's total revenue. NAND revenue increased 32% sequentially, with bit shipments increasing in the high single-digit percentage range and prices increasing by approximately 20%. Now turning to revenue by business unit. Compute and Networking Business Unit revenue was $2.6 billion, up 18% sequentially. DRAM data center revenue more than doubled year-over-year. Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $1.6 billion, down 1% sequentially as a planned decline in volume was partially offset by improved pricing. Embedded Business Unit revenue was $1.3 billion, up 16% sequentially driven by record revenue in automotive. Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $1.4 billion, up 50% sequentially with growth across all end markets. We achieved record data center SSD revenue, which nearly doubled sequentially. The consolidated gross margin for fiscal Q3 was approximately 28%, up over 8 percentage points sequentially driven primarily by higher pricing and helped by product mix and cost reductions. Excluding the effects of previously written-down inventories on fiscal Q2 gross margin, the sequential improvement in fiscal Q3 would have been 15 percentage points. As a reminder, previously written-down inventories had no impact on fiscal Q3 gross margin and will not affect our gross margin moving forward. Operating expenses in fiscal Q3 were $976 million, up $17 million quarter-over-quarter. Continued spend discipline and ongoing operational efficiencies helped deliver operating expenses at the low end of the guidance range. We generated operating income of $941 million in fiscal Q3, resulting in an operating margin of 14%, which was up 10 percentage points sequentially and up 53 percentage points from the year-ago quarter. Fiscal Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $2.9 billion, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 43%, up 6 percentage points sequentially and up 30 percentage points or $2.4 billion from the year-ago quarter. Fiscal Q3 taxes were $227 million, lower than expectations at the time of our guidance, driven by one-time discrete items. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in fiscal Q3 was $0.62, compared to $0.42 in the prior quarter and a loss per share of $1.43 in the year-ago quarter. Fiscal Q3 non-GAAP EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $0.10, driven by better revenue and profitability. Turning to cash flows and capital spending, our operating cash flows were $2.5 billion in fiscal Q3, representing 36% of revenue. Capital expenditures were $2.1 billion during the quarter, and we generated free cash flow of $425 million. Our fiscal Q3 ending inventory was $8.5 billion or 155 days, a decline of five days from the prior quarter. Our leading-edge supply continues to be very tight for both DRAM and NAND. On the balance sheet, we held $9.2 billion of cash and investments at quarter end and maintained near $12 billion of liquidity when including our untapped credit facility. Considering our ample liquidity, return to free cash flow generation, and strong outlook, during the quarter, we repaid $650 million of debt maturing in November 2025. We ended the quarter with $13.3 billion in total debt, low net leverage, and a weighted average maturity on our debt of 2031. Now turning to our outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter. We expect DRAM bit shipments to be flattish and NAND shipments to be up slightly in fiscal Q4. We forecast shipment growth to strengthen modestly in the November quarter. We project continued gross margin expansion. Pricing trends remain positive, supported by favorable supply-demand conditions. Portfolio mix will be an important contributor over time as HBM, high-capacity DIMMs, data center SSDs, and other high-value products increase as a portion of our mix. The high mix for our leading-edge nodes supports front-end cost reductions in line with our long-term cost-reduction CAGRs, excluding HBM on DRAM. Keep in mind that higher mix of HBM will offset non-HBM DRAM cost reductions, but HBM will be at accretive gross margins. We forecast operating expenses to increase sequentially in the fiscal fourth quarter due to an increase in R&D program expenses and a nonrecurring Q3 asset sale gain contemplated in our Q3 guidance. We estimate fiscal Q4 tax expense of approximately $320 million. For fiscal 2025, we estimate our non-GAAP tax rate to be in the mid-teens percent range. We project days of inventory outstanding to decline through fiscal 2025 and DIO to approach our target by the end of fiscal year 2025. We forecast capital expenditures to increase sequentially in the fiscal fourth quarter to approximately $3 billion. Despite this increase in CapEx, we project continued positive free cash flow in fiscal Q4. We expect full year fiscal 2024 CapEx of around $8 billion. Record revenue and significantly improved profitability in fiscal 2025 will help support average quarterly CapEx in fiscal 2025 to be meaningfully above the fiscal Q4 2024 level of $3 billion. We expect CapEx around mid-30%s range of revenue for fiscal 2025, which will support HBM assembly and test equipment, fab and back-end facility construction, as well as technology transition investment to support demand growth. As noted earlier, half or more of the expected CapEx increase in fiscal 2025 will be to support U.S. greenfield fab construction. As we have noted in the past, the CHIPS grants, ITC, and state incentives offset a significant portion of the U.S. fab CapEx investments. Receipt of some of these incentive reimbursements occurs well after when we incur the spend, resulting in higher CapEx for a period while we ramp our greenfield U.S. investments. Micron will remain disciplined in our capital spending and will modulate our WFE investments to grow bit supply in line with industry demand. With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for the fiscal Q4 is as follows. We expect revenue to be $7.6 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in the range of 34.5%, plus or minus 100 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $1.06 billion, plus or minus $15 million. We expect tax expenses of approximately $320 million. Based on a share count of approximately 1.1 billion shares, we expect EPS to be $1.08 per share, plus or minus $0.08. In closing, market conditions are improving, with price increases driven by favorable supply-demand trends and tightness on the leading edge. Micron is executing well on leveraging our technology leadership to grow our mix of high-value solutions, especially in products that support AI applications. Finally, our leading-edge investments and productivity initiatives are delivering cost-downs and operating leverage during this market recovery. We expect record revenue and significantly better profitability in fiscal 2025 to support disciplined investment to maintain stable bit share and deliver free cash flow growth. I will now turn it back over to Sanjay.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Mark. I want to close by commending our team in Taiwan for their response to the significant earthquake in fiscal Q3. In many ways, that response exemplifies Micron, an agile, prepared team that assesses and reacts quickly, supported by a brilliant network of colleagues around the globe. That collaboration, planning, discipline, and experience are precisely what ensures Micron is so well positioned today. I look forward to our teams accelerating Micron's memory and storage leadership as AI solutions present increasing opportunities to provide greater value, from data centers to the edge. Thank you for joining us today. We will now open for questions.
Operator: Certainly. And one moment for our first question. Our first question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Your question, please.
Krish Sankar: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two questions. Sanjay, the first one. It's on HBM. Clearly, you're gaining traction in HBM3E. I'm just curious how the HBM3E is, and how is the qualification going beyond one customer? Last time, you publicly said that you're qualified at NVIDIA's H200. I'm kind of curious, how is it going with the B100 for NVIDIA? And also, along the same path, your competitors spoke about pulling in the timeframe for HBM4 versus the regular 18-month cadence for HBM technology transit system. So, basically, I'm curious, Sanjay, any comment on HBM3E? Call a different customer, timing of HBM4 would help. Then I have a quick follow-up.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, let me start off by again pointing out that we delivered over $100 million in revenue in fiscal Q3 with our HBM3E. And I'm very pleased with our team's focus on this and delivering this number. And note that this was margin accretive to our overall margins, but also to our DRAM margins. And of course, we remain very much focused on delivering several hundred million dollars in fiscal 2024 for HBM revenue. And as I noted, multiple billion dollars in revenue. And in HBM, we are very much focused on continuing to ramp our production and also to improve our yields. And that is, of course, an important priority. And any new product that is as complex as HBM or any new technology node always has a yield ramp, and the team is extremely focused on that. So, as we look ahead to 2025, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our market share consistent with DRAM share some time in 2025. And again, very pleased with Micron's strong product of HBM3E that, as I noted, has been well recognized by our customers to have 30% better power than any competitor's product that is out there. Now, regarding your question on qualifications, of course, we are in qualifications with other customers as well. And as I noted in my remarks, that in 2025 timeframe, we expect to be broadening, diversifying our customer base as well. And HBM4, I mentioned in my remarks that we have a strong roadmap ahead for HBM4 and HBM4E. And we feel very good about our capabilities there, the roadmap that we have in front of us, and our ability to deliver leadership with HBM4 and HBM4E as well.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Thanks, Sanjay, for that. Another quick follow-up, on NAND, in this -- on the NAND bit demand, you kind of mentioned that the bit growth -- demand bit growth is going to be in the high teens. If I remember right, last quarter, you said it's going to be in the low 20%s. So, I'm kind of curious, what was the delta since last few months ago? Because there's a general view that AI should be helping NAND. So, why is the NAND bit demand growth not going higher? Looks like it's going lower. Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, what I would tell you, Krish, is that there is really not much of a difference between the CAGR that we shared last time versus the CAGR we shared here. And I'll also tell you that we basically revised the base year for the CAGR that we used. So, this time, the CAGR that we used, we used the base year of 2023. And in 2023, as you know, we had a bit demand growth in NAND that was higher, meaningfully higher than the CAGR. So, that, of course, the larger base of 2023 just somewhat changed our outlook on the overall CAGR. But you're absolutely right to note, as we have also highlighted, that data center SSDs are a good growth demand driver. And I'll just provide you some color. The data center, automotive, and industrial, these are all growing faster in terms of NAND demand versus the CAGR that we have shared. Client, mobile, and consumer somewhat slower. But these slow-growing segments actually have also average capacity increases ahead of them. As I gave you examples of AI PCs and AI smartphones driving content growth. And we have just conservatively planned for this, perhaps. And we will continue to assess the average capacity growth in smartphones and PCs in the times ahead. And it's important that the CAGR that we highlight here, this is what we use for our capacity planning. And we want to, of course, always remain disciplined with respect to our capacity planning and very much focusing on demand-supply balance and ROI.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Thanks a lot, Sanjay. Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your question, please.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Sanjay, you mentioned a 3x trade ratio of HBM to D5. What happens to this ratio as you go to higher stacks, 12-high or more? And on the other hand, what happens as you make yield improvements? Just overall, is 3x still the operative assumption for calendar '25? And just what are the puts and takes around this ratio?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Yes, I mean, I think for HBM3E, 3x here is the operative guidance here with respect to the trade ratio. And again, just keep in mind that this already accounts for the larger die that exists with HBM3E given its performance and packaging and overall product expectations, as well as, of course, with the 8-die stack, as well as the logic die in there, the mature yield expectations there as well. And as the yield will be ramping up for us, of course, we will be able to get the benefit on the lower cost as we go forward. But with mature yields, the trade ratio with HBM3E is about 3 times over the mature yields of D5 in the same technology node. And as you go up to HBM4, of course, the trade ratio, as we have said before, increases and goes higher than 3x. And as you go up from 8-die stack to 12-die stack in HBM3E, of course, 12-die stack will have somewhat lower mature yields as well. That's just the nature of how device yields work. And -- but the operative guidance, I think, remains still 3x for HBM3E and greater than that for HBM4, inclusive of the assumption of mature yields. And, of course, our assumption of mature yields here is world-class mature yields.
Vivek Arya: Got it. And a quick follow-up, maybe for Mark. So, you're suggesting fiscal '25 could be a record in terms of sales. Why can't it be a record in terms of gross margins? What are the puts and takes of gross margins as we go into next year? So, maybe give us some sense of what incremental margins can be. Let's say sales are up $5 billion or $10 billion year-on-year, just so we can level-set our model from a gross margin perspective. Thank you.
Mark Murphy: Yes, Vivek, we're happy to take that. We're not providing fiscal year '25 guidance yet. I can talk about some sequential improvements from here. Of course, we guided a 600 basis point increase gross margin guidance between third quarter and the guide and fourth. And, yes, that's driven by price, but also mix is beginning to become a more substantive factor in the sequential gross margin expansions. We see November quarter, we see gross margin expansion continuing up a few hundred basis points. Again, price is a factor, but also, as a fourth quarter mix, participating in the -- or contributing to the increase. And that's the effect of HBM and high-capacity DIMMs and other higher-value products. We do expect through fiscal '25 for price to continue to increase, and we expect this favorable mix effect to continue to increase. You've seen very clearly in the third quarter and our fourth quarter guide, the strength in data center, and we see that growth continuing. And then later in the year, we see replacement cycle for smartphone and PC. And then the associated content with AI picking up. So, we expect that to, again, second half of the calendar year in the early '25 for that to kick in. Then on the supply side, you've got just tight conditions. You've got structurally lower capacity in the industry. Inventories are trending down, which we believe ours will trend down through fiscal '25 to close to our target by the end of '25. And then just the HBM trade ratio, which Sanjay just commented on. And then, of course, I talked about in the sequential gross margin, talked about the mix that we see in the business with our higher-value products, which are HBM, high-capacity DIMMs, SSDs, which we've talked about. So, the momentum is very strong. We've got technology leadership. We've got the best product position the Company's ever had. And the manufacturing is operating very well. So, well-positioned for fiscal '25.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.
Toshiya Hari: Hi. Thank you so much for taking the question. I had two as well. The first one on HBM, I guess recently there have been a couple of reports about you all having some yield issues. Just based on your commentary, it didn't sound like you were having these issues, but just wanted to clarify that. If you could address that, that would be really helpful. And then on HBM, the second part is, so gross margins are intuitive to overall corporate margins today. What are your thoughts on sort of relative profitability going into the second half of the year and into calendar '25, particularly given the fact that you have pretty good visibility as it pertains to HBM pricing?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, regarding the yield, I think I already commented that we are pleased that in the very first quarter of production, we were able to ship over $100 million of HBM revenue. And we remain focused on our goals and remain confident about our goals of delivering several hundred million dollars of revenue in fiscal '24 and a multiple hundred billions of dollars of revenue in fiscal '25 and getting to our share to be in line with -- our share for HBM to be in line with our DRAM share sometime in 2025. So, of course, our yield assumptions are baked in in all of that. And we look to continue to work on all aspects of ramping up our capacity. And, of course, we expect to improve yields as we go forward. Again, that is typical of any new technology, any new product that you ramp up. So, that's what we remain focused on. And regarding the gross margin comment, maybe Mark can add some color. But as I mentioned earlier, the gross margin is accretive not only for -- to our corporate margins, but it is also accretive to our DRAM margins. And our DRAM margins, as you know, tend to be higher than our corporate margins, which are lower because of the lower margins in NAND, generally in the industry.
Mark Murphy: It is helping to drive continued gross margin expansion through '25.
Toshiya Hari: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, maybe one for Mark on CapEx. So, you're guiding fiscal year '25 up materially, given some of the hints that you've provided, maybe you're looking at a mid-teens billion dollar number for fiscal '25. I know more than half of that or half of that is coming from the greenfield investments in the U.S., but how should we be thinking about your bit supply growth in fiscal '25 or calendar '25? Should we expect you guys to grow more or less in line with the demand CAGR you have for DRAM and NAND, mid-teens and high-teens respectively, or do you expect to undershift relative to those ranges in fiscal '25? Thank you.
Mark Murphy: Yes, we -- good questions, Toshiya. And your view on CapEx, we've given enough that we don't want to guide revenue for '25 because we -- we'll do that at a future date by quarter. But we do expect a material increase year-over-year. For the quarter, sequentially, we'll see a meaningful step up, and we were at $3 billion, we increased from $2.1 billion to $3 billion third quarter to fourth quarter guide. I would characterize that both on a dollar and percent basis as more than meaningful, so it would be less than that sequentially. But we are spending more. Yes, to your question on, we are very constrained on bits, bit production, and so we will -- as I mentioned in my earlier comments, we will certainly see inventory levels come down. In fact, we expect to be approaching target inventory levels by the end of 2025.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And now our next question comes from the line of Thomas O'Malley from Barclays. Your question, please.
Thomas O'Malley: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. This is for Sanjay or Mark. So, you've given us the fiscal year '25 kind of Company guidance of several billion in HBM. And then you've kind of talked about the share that you're getting to is equivalent to that of DRAM. So, you kind of saw for that market low teens, total HBM market. I just kind of want to understand, what's your view of the suppliers to that market? As it stands today, it seems like there's really two major suppliers. When you look at the out year, do you think that number changes if there is additional qualifications? Would that number change if you were to have a third qualification, aka, the market be bigger? And how did you kind of come up with that total market number? Is that kind of a bottoms-up accelerator forecast? But just kind of how you're thinking about the market. And did that change or is it contingent upon qualifications of some of your competitors?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Well, as we have said before, that we see the CAGR for HBM growth, in terms of bit growth CAGR to be well above 50% over the next few years. So, certainly, HBM is a strong growth driver. And again, as we increase our mix of HBM going forward, it will of course be continuing to be accretive to our financial performance, including margins. And we are pleased that with the strong performance that we have, we are sold out for '25 as well, with a overwhelming part of our output already committed in terms of pricing. So, that points to a strong position that we have in terms of continuing to work toward achieving our goal of getting to our HBM market share to be in line with DRAM share sometime in 2025. And of course, we are working with a broad range of customers, in qualifications, and next year we plan to be shipping to broader set of customers. Having said all of that, no question that HBM is a complex product for our customers to qualify as well. It's highly resource intensive, not just for us, but for our customers as well. And this is where we think that our strong product position, highlighting again those attributes of 30% better power than nearest competitor, and a better performance, and really high quality here positions us well when customers work with those resource-intensive qualifications for Micron. And that's what we are already seeing in terms of our engagement. So, we feel pretty good about our plans here for HBM.
Thomas O'Malley: Super helpful. And then just switching gears over to the NAND side of things. Obviously, you had a competitor out in the market talking about kind of run rate industry CapEx and kind of talking about the change in industry architecture, maybe not scaling as quickly or as capital intensively as you had in the past. You obviously are talking about CapEx. A lot of your CapEx next year is going towards greenfield and HBM. Could you talk to the remainder of that CapEx? Could you give us any color on DRAM or NAND split between that? And then do you agree with, in this instance, it was Western Digital talking about capital intensity longer term on the NAND side? Do you agree that maybe structurally you'll see a lower investment threshold in the future to kind of continue to maintain what the industry needs?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, for us, certainly, our CapEx is dominated by our DRAM-related CapEx. That's certainly HBM because it's growing as mixed in the industry and HBM is capital intensive when it comes to unique clean room requirements for HBM and in packaging and assembly as well as test equipment. So, our CapEx is dominated by that, as well as to meet the future requirements in the second half of this decade. And that involves the construction of the fab. So, NAND CapEx is certainly a much smaller portion of our total CapEx. And we have a very strong technology position with our NAND and strong portfolio that you see. And we are continuing to shift that portfolio toward higher-value solutions as well. So, we certainly will remain extremely disciplined when it comes to NAND as well in terms of driving the CapEx. And we will be disciplined in terms of driving our technology node transitions in the timing of node transitions across the industry. I think it is certainly helpful given the bit growth that you get from those transitions to slow down the timing of those -- the cadence of those node transitions so that your bit growth CAGR versus the gain of bits that you get from the wafers can be managed well. These are the kind of things we are very much focused on in order to maintain a good supply discipline, maintain supply growth that is very much in line with the demand growth, and managing our CapEx here prudently. But yes, I mean overall our CapEx is -- in NAND is significantly smaller, but we remain extremely disciplined, focused on managing our supply growth in line with demand there. And again, I want to point out that with NAND, technology transitions are sufficient to meet the demand growth. We do not need the new clean room, the new greenfield fabs, the kind that are needed in DRAM. And HBM and the trade ratio of HBM with standard DRAM is a factor in the greenfield requirements only, also.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Danely from Citi. Your question, please.
Christopher Danely: Hi, thanks, guys. So, I think you mentioned you are signing up some customers to long-term contracts. Given your belief that the pricing is going to keep going up, why sign people up to long-term contracts and potentially miss out on some of the increased pricing? Or is there some potential for wiggle room on pricing with the contracts and it is more of a unit basis? Just curious there.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Well, the long-term contracts really help us and customers get closer, not only with respect to, let's say, supply or pricing discussions as may be relevant to our various customer contracts, but also with respect to the technology roadmap, the product roadmap, the timing of the supply. And they are very helpful factors in building a close relationship with the customers. And you can see that we are pointing to a substantial revenue record in 2025, of course leveraging some of these contracts that we have put in place. And we have also pointed to a significant improvement in profitability. So, I think we are well positioned in these contracts with respect to not only the supply and demand fundamentals, but also with respect to the financial aspects.
Christopher Danely: Great. Thanks, Sanjay. And then just a quick one for Mark. Mark, was the Taiwan quake impact limited to the May quarter, or is it impacting the current quarter as well?
Mark Murphy: Not a material impact, Chris.
Christopher Danely: It was just May. All right. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your question, please.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Enterprise SSDs are seeing really strong demand pull from AI workloads, right? The team has driven significant share gains in enterprise SSD just over the past few quarters. I think in calendar Q1, I think Micron was the number three global share leader in enterprise SSD. I think it's now about 20%, 25% of the overall NAND business. I mean, this is a position that we've never seen Micron in before. So, I think first question is, are enterprise SSD gross margins accretive to your overall NAND gross margins? And then secondly, I saw your next-gen PCIe Gen5 SSD demo at NVIDIA's GTC conference. Pretty significant performance uplift on AI workloads versus your Gen4 SSDs. So, are you qualifying these next-gen Gen5 SSDs for AI applications? When do you expect to shift? Just wanted to understand the sustainability of your strong share position here.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Well, thank you, Harlan, for recognizing the strong momentum that Micron's data center SSD have. And certainly, our data center SSDs are accretive to our overall NAND margins. And we have really great products. I already highlighted in my prepared remarks that we saw tripling of bits that we shipped with our 32-layer NAND AI SSDs going absolutely toward AI data center applications. And we have a broad set of customers that we are working with in terms of growing our share. So, we see -- when we talk about sequentially, we had 50% increase in revenue for our data center products, of course, that includes the benefit of our strong data center SSD roadmap. And yes, I mean, we will, of course, continue to work with our Gen5 SSDs in terms of working with customers for qualifying and not prepared to discuss, at this point, specifics regarding timing of some of the roadmap that is in front of us for shipments. So, yes, in terms of sustainability of the strong improvement to share, we are definitely with our strong product portfolio counting on it. And this will -- our SSD momentum, data center SSD momentum, will absolutely contribute also toward my remarks that I said that we will increase our mix of data center revenue in fiscal year '25 as well. Of course, HBM, high-density DIMMs, these will, of course, be a big part of it. But also, data center SSDs is going to be another big part of our growth in fiscal 2025 related to data center revenue.
Mark Murphy: So, I would just add, Harlan, that the storage business unit delivered operating profit in the quarter.
Harlan Sur: Perfect. Thank you very much. Insightful.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session, as well as today's program. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-03-20 16:30:00) =====

Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Satya. Good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report that Micron delivered fiscal Q2 revenue, gross margin, and EPS well above the high end of guidance. Micron has returned to profitability and delivered positive operating margin a quarter ahead of expectation. I would like to thank all our Micron global team members for their dedication and excellent execution that made this result possible. Micron drove robust price increases as the supply-demand balance tightened. This improvement in market conditions was due to a confluence of factors, including strong AI server demand, a healthier demand environment in most end markets, and supply reductions across the industry. AI server demand is driving rapid growth in HBM, DDR5, and data center SSDs, which is tightening leading-edge supply availability for DRAM and NAND. This is resulting in a positive ripple effect on pricing across all memory and storage end markets. We expect DRAM and NAND pricing levels to increase further throughout calendar year 2024 and expect record revenue and much improved profitability now in fiscal year 2025. Micron is at the forefront of ramping the industry's most advanced technology nodes in both DRAM and NAND. Reinforcing our leadership position, over three-quarters of our DRAM bits are now on leading-edge 1-alpha and 1-beta nodes, and over 90% of our NAND bits are on 176-layer and 232-layer nodes. We expect fiscal 2024 front-end cost reductions, excluding the impact of HBM, to track in line with our long-term expectations of mid to high single digits in DRAM and low teens in NAND, supported by the continued volume ramp of 1-beta DRAM and 232-layer NAND. We continue to mature our production capability with extreme ultraviolet lithography and have achieved equivalent yield and quality on our 1-alpha as well as 1-beta nodes between EUV and non-EUV flows. We have begun 1-gamma DRAM pilot production using EUV and are on track for volume production in calendar 2025. The development of our next-generation NAND node is on track, with volume production planned for calendar 2025. We expect to maintain our technology leadership in NAND. Now turning to our end markets. Inventories for memory and storage have improved significantly in the data center, and we continue to expect normalization in the first half of calendar 2024. In PC and smartphone, there were some strategic purchases in calendar Q4 in anticipation of a return to unit growth. Inventories remain near normal levels for auto, industrial, and other markets. We are in the very early innings of a multiyear growth phase driven by AI as this disruptive technology will transform every aspect of business and society. The race is on to create artificial general intelligence, or AGI, which will require ever-increasing model sizes with trillions of parameters. On the other end of the spectrum, there is considerable progress being made on improving AI models, so that they can run on edge devices, like PCs and smartphones, and create new and compelling capabilities. As AI training workloads remain a driver of technology and innovation, inference growth is also rapidly accelerating. Memory and storage technologies are key enablers of AI in both training and inference workloads, and Micron is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends in both the data center and the edge. We view Micron as one of the biggest beneficiaries in the semiconductor industry of this multiyear growth opportunity driven by AI. In data center, total industry server unit shipments are expected to grow mid to high single digits in calendar 2024, driven by strong growth for AI servers and a return to modest growth for traditional servers. Micron is well positioned with our portfolio of HBM, D5, LP5, high-capacity DIMM, CXL, and data center SSD products. Delivering improved memory bandwidth, power consumption, and overall performance is critical to enable cost-efficient scaling of AI workloads inside modern GPU or ASIC-accelerated AI servers. Our customers are driving an aggressive AI roadmap on their GPU and ASIC-based server platforms that require significantly higher content and higher-performance memory and storage solutions. For example, earlier this week, Nvidia announced its next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture-based AI systems, which provides a 33% increase in the HBM3E content, continuing a trend of steadily increasing HBM content per GPU. Micron's industry-leading high-bandwidth memory HBM3E solution provides more than 20 times the memory bandwidth compared to standard D5-based DIMM server module. We are executing well on our HBM product ramp plans and have made significant progress in ramping our capacity, yields, and quality. We commenced volume production and recognized our first revenue from HBM3E in fiscal Q2 and now have begun high-volume shipments of our HBM3E product. Customers continue to give strong feedback that our HBM3E solution has a 30% lower power consumption compared to competitors' solutions. This benefit is contributing to strong demand. Our HBM3E product will be a part of Nvidia's H200 Tensor Core GPUs, and we are making progress on additional platform qualifications with multiple customers. We are on track to generate several hundred million dollars of revenue from HBM in fiscal 2024 and expect HBM revenues to be accretive to our DRAM and overall gross margins starting in the fiscal third quarter. Our HBM is sold out for calendar 2024, and the overwhelming majority of our 2025 supply has already been allocated. We continue to expect HBM bit share equivalent to our overall DRAM bit share some time in calendar 2025. Earlier this month, we sampled our 12-high HBM3E product, which provides 50% increased capacity of DRAM per cube to 36 gigabyte. This increase in capacity allows our customers to pack more memory per GPU, enabling more powerful AI training and inference solutions. We expect 12-high HBM3E will start ramping in high-volume production and increase in mix throughout 2025. We have a robust roadmap and we are confident we will maintain our technology leadership with HBM4, the next generation of HBM, which will provide further performance and capacity enhancements compared to HBM3E. We are making strong progress on our suite of high-capacity server DIMM products. During the quarter, we completed validation of the industry's first mono-die-based 128 gigabyte server DRAM module. This new product provides the industry's highest-bandwidth D5 capability, with greater than 20% better energy efficiency and over 15% improved latency performance compared to competitors' 3D TSV-based solutions. We see strong customer pull and expect a robust volume ramp for our 128 gigabyte product, with several hundred million dollars of revenue in the second half of fiscal 2024. Additionally, we also started sampling our 256 gigabyte MCRDIMM module, which further enhances performance and increases DRAM content per server. We achieved record revenue share in the data center SSD market in calendar 2023. During the quarter, we grew our revenue by over 50% sequentially for our 232-layer-based 6500 30 terabytes SSDs, which offer best-in-class performance, reliability, and endurance for AI data lake applications. In PC, after two years of double-digit declines, unit volumes are expected to grow modestly in the low single-digit range for calendar 2024. We are encouraged by the strong ecosystem momentum to develop next-generation AI PCs, which feature high-performance Neural Processing Unit chipsets and 40% to 80% more DRAM content versus today's average PCs. We expect next-generation AI PC units to grow and become a meaningful portion of total PC units in calendar 2025. At CES, the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas, Micron launched the industry's first low-power compression-attached memory module, or LPCAMM2, for PC applications. LPCAMM2 brings a modular form factor, with a maximum capacity point of 64 gigabyte for PC module and 128 gigabyte for server module, along with a number of benefits such as higher bandwidth, lower power, and smaller form factor. During the quarter, we launched our 232-layer-based Crucial T705 Gen 5 consumer SSD, which won several editor choice awards and was recognized by a leading publisher as the fastest M.2 SSD ever. We increased our client SSD QLC bit shipments to record levels, with QLC representing nearly two-thirds of our client SSD shipments, firmly establishing Micron as the leader in client QLC SSDs. Turning to mobile. Smartphone unit volumes in calendar 2024 remain on track to grow low to mid-single digits. Smartphones offer tremendous potential for personalized AI capabilities that offer greater security and responsiveness when executed on device. Enabling these on-device AI capabilities is driving increased memory and storage capacity needs and increasing demand for new value-add solutions. For example, we expect AI phones to carry 50% to 100% greater DRAM content compared to non-AI flagship phones today. Micron's leading mobile solutions provide the critical high performance and power efficiency needed to unlock an unprecedented level of AI capability. In DRAM, we are now sampling our second-generation, 1-beta LPDRAM LP5X product, which delivers the industry's highest performance at improved power for flagship smartphones. And in NAND, we announced our second generation of 232-layer NAND UFS 4.0 devices, featuring the industry's smallest package and breakthrough features that enable greater reliability and significantly higher real-world performance for complex workloads. Our mobile DRAM and NAND solutions are now widely adopted in industry-leading flagship smartphones, with two examples being Samsung's Galaxy S24 and the Honor Magic 6 Pro announced this year. The Samsung Galaxy S24 can provide two-way, real-time voice and text translations during live phone calls. The Honor Magic 6 Pro features the Magic LM, a seven-billion parameter large language model, which can intelligently understand a user's intent based on language, image, eye movement, and gestures and proactively offer services to enhance and simplify the user experience. Turning to auto and industrial. The automotive sector continues to experience robust demand for memory and storage as non-memory semiconductor supply constraints have eased and as new vehicle platforms are launched. In the past quarter, we experienced strong growth with partners who are driving the most advanced capabilities within the automobile's increasingly intelligent and connected digital cockpits. In addition, adoption of Level 2+ ADAS capabilities continues to gain momentum, further expanding content per vehicle. The industrial market fundamentals for memory are also healthy, with improving distributor inventory, book-to-bill, and demand visibility improvements, as well as pricing benefits from the tight supply for products, especially those built on leading-edge nodes. Now, turning to our market outlook. Calendar 2023 DRAM bit demand growth was in the low double-digit percentage range, and NAND bit demand growth was in the low-20s percentage range, both a few percentage points higher than previous expectations. We forecast calendar 2024 bit demand growth for the industry to be near the long-term CAGR for DRAM and around the mid-teens for NAND. Given the higher baseline of 2023 demand, these expectations of 2024 bit growth have driven an increase in the absolute level of 2024 bit demand in our model for DRAM and NAND versus our prior expectations. The industry supply-demand balance is tight for DRAM and NAND, and our outlook for pricing has increased for calendar 2024. Over the medium term, we expect bit demand growth CAGRs of mid-teens in DRAM and low-20s percentage range in NAND. Turning to supply. The supply outlook remains roughly the same as last quarter. We expect calendar 2024 industry supply to be below demand for both DRAM and NAND. Micron's bit supply growth in fiscal 2024 remains below our demand growth for both DRAM and NAND, and we expect to decrease our days of inventory in fiscal year 2024. Micron's fiscal 2024 CapEx plan remains unchanged at a range between $7.5 billion and $8.0 billion. We continue to project our WFE spending will be down year-on-year in fiscal 2024. Micron's capital-efficient approach to reuse equipment from older nodes to support conversions to leading-edge nodes has resulted in a material structural reduction of our DRAM and NAND wafer capacities. We are now fully utilized on our high-volume manufacturing nodes and are maximizing output against the structurally lowered capacity. We believe this approach to node migration and consequent wafer capacity reduction is an industry-wide phenomenon. We project to end fiscal 2024 with low double-digit percentage less wafer capacity in both DRAM and NAND than our peak levels in fiscal 2022. Significant supply reductions across the industry have enabled the pricing recovery that is now underway. Although our financial performance has improved, our current profitability levels are still well below our long-term targets, and significantly improved profitability is required to support the R&D and CapEx investments needed for long-term innovation and supply growth. Micron will continue to exercise supply and CapEx discipline and focus on restoring improved profitability while maintaining our bit market share for DRAM and NAND. As discussed previously, the ramp of HBM production will constrain supply growth in non-HBM products. Industrywide, HBM3E consumes approximately three times the wafer supply as D5 to produce a given number of bits in the same technology node. With increased performance and packaging complexity, across the industry, we expect the trade ratio for HBM4 to be even higher than the trade ratio for HBM3E. We anticipate strong HBM demand due to AI, combined with increasing silicon intensity of the HBM roadmap, to contribute to tight supply conditions for DRAM across all the end markets. Finally, as we consider these demand and technology trends, we are carefully planning our global fab and assembly/test capacity requirements to ensure a diversified and cost-competitive manufacturing footprint. Announced projects in China, India, and Japan are proceeding as planned. On potential U.S. expansion plans, we have assumed CHIPS grants in our CapEx plans for fiscal 2024. Our planned Idaho and New York projects require Micron to receive the combination of sufficient CHIPS grants, investment tax credits, and local incentives to address the cost difference compared to overseas expansion. I will now turn it over to Mark for our financial results and outlook.
Mark Murphy: Thanks, Sanjay, and good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered strong results in fiscal Q2 with revenue, gross margin, and EPS well above the high end of the guidance ranges provided in our last earnings call. Much improved market conditions, along with the team's excellent execution on pricing, products, and operations, drove the strong financial results. Total fiscal Q2 revenue was $5.8 billion, up 23% sequentially and up 58% year-over-year. Fiscal Q2 DRAM revenue was approximately $4.2 billion, representing 71% of total revenue. DRAM revenue increased 21% sequentially, with bit shipments increasing by a low single-digit percentage and prices increasing by high teens. Fiscal Q2 NAND revenue was approximately $1.6 billion, representing 27% of Micron's total revenue. NAND revenue increased 27% sequentially, with bit shipments decreasing by a low single-digit percentage and prices increasing by over 30%. Now turning to revenue by business unit. Compute and Networking Business Unit revenue was $2.2 billion, up 26% sequentially. Data center revenue grew robustly, and cloud more than doubled sequentially. Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $1.6 billion, up 24% sequentially, as an expected decline in volume was more than offset by improved pricing. Embedded Business Unit revenue was $1.1 billion, up 7% sequentially on solid demand for leading-edge products in the industrial market. Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $905 million, up 39% sequentially with strong double-digit growth across all end markets. Datacenter SSD revenue more than doubled from a year ago, driven by share gains for Micron's products. The consolidated gross margin for fiscal Q2 was 20%, up 19 percentage points sequentially driven by higher pricing. Fiscal Q2 gross margins benefited from $382 million associated with selling the remainder of previously written-down inventories. In the second fiscal quarter, underutilization charges were modest and related to our legacy manufacturing capacity. We expect to sustain these lower levels of underutilization charges moving forward. Operating expenses in fiscal Q2 were $959 million, down $33 million quarter-over-quarter and in line with our guidance range. OpEx was modestly above the midpoint of our guidance range, as variable compensation expense was higher on an improved fiscal 2024 outlook. We generated operating income of $204 million in fiscal Q2, resulting in an operating margin of 4% and turning positive a quarter earlier than originally forecasted. We recognized a net benefit for income taxes in fiscal Q2 of $294 million. We had previously guided that we would recognize tax expense of $45 million based on expected quarterly results for fiscal Q2. With our improved fiscal 2024 outlook, we can now estimate a more reliable annual effective tax rate and have reverted to a global annual effective tax rate method. The second fiscal quarter tax benefit arises from applying this estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date results. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in fiscal Q2 was $0.42, compared to a loss per share of $0.95 in the prior quarter and a loss per share of $1.91 in the year-ago quarter. Fiscal Q2 EPS benefited from the aforementioned favorable income tax effect of approximately $0.34 per share. Turning to cash flows and capital spending, our operating cash flows were approximately $1.2 billion in fiscal Q2, representing 21% of revenue. Capital expenditures were $1.2 billion during the quarter, and free cash flow was near breakeven. Our fiscal Q2 ending inventory was $8.4 billion or 160 days, roughly in line with the prior quarter. Finished goods were down in the quarter. Our leading-edge supply both for DRAM and NAND is very tight. We expect to reduce inventory levels and excluding strategic inventory stock, be within a few weeks of our 120 days target by the end of fiscal 2024. We project DIO improvements to continue into fiscal year 2025. On the balance sheet, we held $9.7 billion of cash and investments at quarter end and maintained $12.2 billion of liquidity when including our untapped credit facility. During fiscal Q2, we refinanced approximately $1 billion of existing debt, extending our debt maturities and lowering our near-term borrowing costs. We ended the quarter with $13.7 billion in total debt, low net leverage, and a weighted average maturity on our debt of 2031. Now turning to our outlook for the fiscal third quarter. Fiscal Q3 bit shipments are expected to be down modestly for DRAM and up somewhat for NAND, compared to fiscal Q2 levels. While demand continues to improve, supply is constrained, especially at the leading edge. We expect DIO to improve sequentially in fiscal Q3. Note that fiscal Q2 gross margins had the benefit from previously written-down inventories, which have cleared completely in fiscal Q2. Despite this benefit in fiscal Q2, we expect solid sequential improvement in fiscal Q3 gross margins due to robust price increases across both DRAM and NAND. We forecast operating expenses to increase by approximately $30 million in the fiscal third quarter, driven by R&D expenses. For the fiscal year, we now project OpEx to be approximately $4 billion. Having delivered operating profit in fiscal Q2 ahead of prior expectations, we forecast continued improvement in operating income through the remainder of the year. Based on an improved taxable income outlook, our tax forecast for fiscal year 2024 has increased from a prior projection of over $300 million to approximately $400 million. In fiscal 2025, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the mid-teens percentage range. We plan fiscal Q3 capital expenditures to be higher than in the second quarter. Our full-year fiscal 2024 CapEx plan is unchanged at a range between $7.5 billion and $8 billion. We now expect to generate positive free cash flow in fiscal Q3 and Q4. With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for fiscal Q3 is as follows. We expect revenue to be $6.6 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in the range of 26.5%, plus or minus 150 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $990 million, plus or minus $15 million. We expect tax expenses of approximately $240 million. Based on a share count of approximately 1.1 billion shares, we expect earnings per share of $0.45, plus or minus $0.07. In closing, with a significantly improved supply demand balance in the industry coupled with excellent execution, Micron is driving a strong inflection in pricing and a richer mix of high-value solutions. We remain disciplined with our investments and supply growth and focused on driving efficiency across the company. We expect positive free cash flow for the second half of fiscal 2024 and project record revenue in fiscal 2025. I will now turn it back over to Sanjay.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Mark. [Technical Difficulty]
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, your program will resume momentarily. Once again, please standby, your program will resume momentarily. Thank you for your patience and please continue to hold.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Hi, can you hear us?
Operator: Yes. Yes. Welcome back. Ladies and gentlemen, we will resume.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Yes, so we apologize for the technical difficulty here. But, operator if you can go ahead and start the Q&A section, please?
Operator: Certainly. One moment for our first question. And our first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.
Toshiya Hari: Hi, can you guys hear me okay?
Operator: Yes.
Mark Murphy: Yes, we can.
Toshiya Hari: Okay, great. Thank you for taking the question. Sanjay on HBM, you mentioned that you continue to expect your market position in '25 or at some point in '25 to be similar, to be in line with your overall position in DRAM. Given your revenue outlook for '24, that seems to imply, I don't know quadrupling or quintupling of your business in HBM year-to-year. I guess part one, am I thinking about the trajectory accurately? And then part two, how should we -- what does that mean for your CapEx over the next 12, 18 months, and more importantly, your wafer capacity? You mentioned fiscal year '24, you're down low-double-digits. Is your wafer capacity likely to be down again in fiscal '25? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So HBM3E, first of all, it's a great product. As I mentioned well received by our customers, high-performance, and 30% lower-power than any other product that's out there. So of course it has strong demand and as we have highlighted, we are sold out for our calendar year '24 supply and calendar year '25 supply is also mostly vast majority is already allocated. We are -- we have just begun production shipments, and these will continue to increase through the course of calendar year '24, as well as continue to increase through calendar year '25. We are continuing to work on increasing our capacity and making good progress with respect to capacity as well as overall yield and quality. So certainly, in calendar year '25 versus calendar year '24, given that we are just starting our production here now, will certainly be a significant growth over our calendar year '24 numbers. And you can look at it the same way for fiscal '24 versus '25, so it will be definitely a significant increase with us, achieving our shares in HBM, in line with our industry share, sometime in calendar '25. I'm not in a position to spell it out exactly for you in terms of what is the volume increase, but certainly HBM with our strong product position, it will be a strong driver of revenue growth, fiscal year '24 -- fiscal year '25 or fiscal year '24. Regarding the wafer capacity by end of this fiscal year, we have said low double-digit structural reduction in capacity. And of course, we will be managing this capacity in fiscal year '24, keeping in mind our focus on supply-demand discipline, I was staying extremely disciplined with respect to supply growth, staying extremely disciplined with respect to our HBM share as well. And advantaging our technology transitions, as we go through the year. And our CapEx in '25 -- well, in fiscal '25 will be higher than fiscal '24. WFE will be higher as well. And of course, construction CapEx related to the Greenfield that is required for the second half of the decade will contribute to some of the CapEx increase in fiscal '25. But some of those details we'll provide you as we get closer to fiscal year '25. So, most important thing is that we will manage our wafer capacity technology transitions to really maintain our bit share, that is part of our strategy to have stable bit share even with increasing penetration of HBM. And again, just keep in mind that our overall framework of our CapEx being 35% of our revenue across the cycles still applies.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you for all the details.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thank you very much for taking the question. I guess two real quick ones. One I just wanted to understand or maybe appreciate the context of the accretive nature of HBM3. I know in the prepared remarks, I think are -- in the slide deck it notes that you'll be accretive gross margin from HBM in the current quarter. And then I know you talked a little bit about PCs and smartphones. I'm curious of -- what you're seeing in terms of traditional server demand and whether or not your forecast assumes any improvement of shipments in that end-market. Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So with respect to the accretive nature of HBM, look, HBM carries a higher cost, but it also carries a significantly higher pricing because it brings such great value in the applications in terms of its performance and power. And we are executing well. Our yield ramp is going well as well according to plan. And therefore, we are pleased that in this quarter when we have begun our production shipments, we will be having it accretive to our gross margins in the quarter. And of course, this momentum will continue to build in the quarters ahead. And regarding the second part of your question on traditional server demand, so yes, we do see that in calendar '25, traditional server demand will grow modestly. And of course, it's coming after a significant decline in server unit sales in calendar '23. We are very pleased to see the increasing momentum of content growth in the traditional server demand. But also AI server units are going up and AI -- we have said overall server units going up in mid- to high-single-digits range with AI server driving a higher growth percentage year-over-year and traditional servers being modest. And I may have said '25 here, I just want to clarify that I'm talking about 2024 here. So when I'm talking about modest server unit growth, it's referring to 2024 versus 2023.
Aaron Rakers: Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: And we are actually seeing strong demand for both our DRAM products and NAND products in server and actually we are shifting some of our portfolio toward these higher mix solutions. HBM being one of them. High-density DIMMs being another one that's in strong demand for server applications and then data center SSDs. All of this is -- we are seeing a healthy demand drivers. And just remember we had said that for memory and storage, customer inventories in data center market would be largely normalized in first half of '24. And we are seeing the market play out just as we had predicted several quarters ago.
Aaron Rakers: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please.
C.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon, thanks for taking the question. I guess, Sanjay, would love to hear your thoughts around wafer movement from Big 3 to HBM and what impact that's having on the supply-demand outlook for DDR5 and sort of any context around customer engagement and longer-term contracts? And then more on the gross margin side, you've talked about the inventory previously written down, now behind us. Can you walk through the moving parts that should dictate what we'll see in gross margins throughout the remainder of calendar '24? Thanks so much.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So on your questions regarding wafers shift to HBM, as we have highlighted that HBM -- HBM3E needs three times more wafers than nearly three times more wafers than DDR5 in the same technology node of the same capacity to produce the same bits. So this is of course highly silicon intensive technology and this factor of three has the trade ratio between HBM and D5 is really common across the industry. So what -- and HBM demand is increasing rapidly, you see all the recent announcements that are only showing you that even greater attach rate of HBM to the latest GPU solutions that were just announced earlier this week. 192 gigabyte in the Blackwell platforms versus the 144 gigabyte. And of course, this is a phenomenon that's occurring across the Board. Even today, I think, Broadcom talked about how HBM content is going to further increase. So HBM is in a high-demand growth phase and this demand growth will continue in terms of bits, in terms of revenue over the course of the foreseeable future. And this is putting tremendous pressure on the non-HBM supply. The trade ratio of three to one, increasing demand in HBM, increasing -- increased profitability of HBM is putting non-HBM part of the memory in tight supply. This is why we say that leading-edge nodes are in very tight supply. And as a result, we would fully expect that D5, as well as other DDR products will improve in their profitability picture as well, given their very much tight supply there. And of course, HBM being in a strong position. When you look at the LTAs, we have talked to you about our supply already being locked up for '24 and '25, and this then increases our confidence in our D5 as well as LP5 -- LPA positions with the customers.
Mark Murphy: And good afternoon, C.J., it's Mark. On the gross margin side, as you mentioned it's been a tough year, plus year and a half on a lot of timing differences, difficult to gauge the cost downs and gross margin progression underutilization effects, lower node transitions, structural capacity-reduction and so forth that we're contributing to the weaker cost downs. And as you mentioned, the lower the written-down inventories, finally cleared in the second quarter. It was a bit of a headwind to actually in the sense that, it was less of a benefit than the first quarter. So, but still, nonetheless it was a favorable benefit that we will market in the third quarter. And then the period costs also reduced from first to second quarter. So, we're now under $50 million on period costs related to underutilization. As I mentioned in my comments that's legacy-related capacity now only and that would continue going forward. So now we see more normal conditions on cost downs and related margin effects. We see node transitions occurring. Those are positive. The underutilization effects are fading away, as we mentioned. We're getting volume leverage and the associated absorption and then just the business being able to focus on efficiency. So as we mentioned before, we're now in the front end would expect mid to high-single-digit cost downs as normal. I think that as you look forward, and Sanjay alluded to this, you will begin to see the costs related to HBM weigh on our cost down performance. Now it's a good trade, of course, because the mix is favorable, the price is higher on those products. So it's an accretive margin trade, but that will impact the cost downs.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question please.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Sanjay, I had a question just around the tenor of the discussions that you're having with your customers. I mean the industry is bigger this year in terms of bits. It sounds like mostly due to a higher baseline coming off last year. But it sounds like supply hasn't really increased to match that higher bits this year. So the balance has gotten even tighter over the past three months. So how has that changed the dynamics of your discussions with your customers? I know you had a $600 million prepay last quarter. Did you get any prepays this quarter? Are you talking about new sort of contract structures with customers where they maybe fund some of your CapEx? Can you kind of talk about all that? Thanks.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So just keep in mind that in fiscal year '24 or calendar '24 versus '23, the shipments will increase substantially. And as you noted, I mean, the year-over-year increase in shipments will be substantial. And as you noted, the supply is very tight. Supply is tight due to the factors that we have discussed before. Due to the downturn that the industry experienced last year, CapEx cuts were made, utilization cuts were made, structural shift from traditional older nodes to newer nodes of equipment was made in order to support the leading-edge nodes. And that resulted in a structural reduction in wafer capacity in the industry as well. And then there is the HBM factor, the trade ratio 3:1 that I have discussed today. All of this has contributed to a very tight supply situation. And as I noted earlier in my remarks, non-HBM supply is tight. So some of our discussions with customers, particularly with respect to HBM, when we talk about that HBM is sold out, those type of contracts have both pricing as well as volumes as well as other stricter terms baked in as part of our LTAs. And 2024 volume as well as pricing is all locked up. 2025, as I mentioned, the volumes are largely allocated. A vast majority of our production supply is allocated, and some of the pricing is already firmed up. Keep in mind, this has never happened before, right, that we are talking about 2025, and we are sitting in CQ1, and we already have so much discussion around supply and pricing for 2025 getting locked up here as we speak. And of course, this is then, as I said earlier, impacting our -- in a positive way, our discussions with non-HBM part of the market with other customers. And so, I mean, this overall tight supply environment bodes well for our ability to manage the pricing increases as well as keep an eye on demand-supply balance and remain extremely disciplined in driving the growth of our business in revenue and profits while continuing to execute our strategy of maintaining stable bit share. So leading edge is very tight, and we are continuing to work on maximizing our output, which means leading edge is running at full utilization at this point.
Timothy Arcuri: Great, thanks. But I guess that means that there were no prepays this quarter, correct?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Well, we have not commented on that. We have not provided any color on that.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay, okay. Thank you, Sanjay.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.
Joseph Moore: Great, thank you. The 128 gig that you talked about getting qualified, it seems like that's a pretty important market in AI. And you guys are approaching it monolithically where I know your competitor has used this packed approach. Can you talk about the reception to that, and you spoke of several hundred million. How big do you think that opportunity could be?
Sanjay Mehrotra: As I said, I mean, in my prepared remarks, that this product has very strong customer pull. This really offers significantly improved latency, as well as energy efficiency. And this is simply due to the architecture that we chose to pursue fully focusing on what is ultimately important to our customers. This mono die architecture just gives you -- versus a stacked architecture gives you the benefit of more simplified interconnect, which results in power efficiency as well as greater performance advantage. So yes, I mean, we are seeing strong reception to this product. And this will -- we have said that this will have a meaningful revenue this fiscal quarter for us and several hundred million dollars of revenue in our fiscal 2024. So clearly on a strong growth rate. And our goal, again, would be to continue to manage the mix of our business across our portfolio in a prudent fashion so that we continue to shift the mix of our products towards more profitable parts of the business, particularly like data centers, solutions, including these high-capacity DIMMs that we just discussed as -- HBM, data center, SSD. So all of this really just shows you that how we are continuing to deliver successfully on strengthening our product portfolio and targeted -- targeting it towards increasing the mix of our business towards more profitable parts of the market.
Joseph Moore: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin from Stifel. Your question, please.
Brian Chin: Hi, great. Thanks for taking our questions and congratulations on the results. I guess it is sort of an extrapolation question. But if HBM worth 20% of Micron DRAM revenue, and you have said that, again, at some point next year, you think on a bit basis, it could be equivalent to your market share, that HBM were 20% of Micron DRAM revenue as opposed to a much lower percentage today. Could you maybe help quantify how accretive to gross margins as that richer mix would represent?
Mark Murphy: Yes. Brian, it's Mark. We won't break it out specifically, but maybe just to give you a sense of the trajectory of gross margins. The increase from first quarter of 1% to 20% in the second quarter was dominantly price. And obviously, a lot of other things going on, but the dominant feature of that increase was price. Likewise, in the 20% second quarter actuals to the 26.5% guide, price remains the largest contributor. And offsetting part of that is, of course, what CJ mentioned on the benefit of those lower cost inventories fade away. So -- but price is still the largest factor. But what begins to come in are both a resumption of cost downs. And then we're starting to see some favorable mix effects for the products that Sanjay talked about, including HBM. And then as we move into the fourth quarter, where we would expect a margin increase comparable to the levels that we saw second to third quarter. That becomes more balanced between price effects and product mix effects and cost downs. And most notably, HBM begins to become more material. And that would then proceed into '25. As we look in '25, we see continued pricing strength in '25. We see favorable product mixes -- product mix in '25. And then our cost downs, excluding the HBM effects, we expect to have good cost down, all contributing to margin expansion.
Brian Chin: Okay. Thank you, very helpful.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And for our last question for today comes from the line of Chris Danely from Citi. Your question, please.
Chris Danely: Hey, thanks, guys. I guess just another multipart question on margins like everybody else. So you mentioned that there's still some underutilization charges related to legacy manufacturing capacity. When do those go away? And then as a follow-up to all these HBM margin questions. Can you just talk about the gross margin arc of your HBM products as more competition and capacity comes on to the market? Like when would the gross margins peak and then start to decline as Samsung starts to increase capacity, your capacity goes up, all that stuff? Thanks.
Mark Murphy: I'll deal with the first question. On the underutilization charges, Chris, they went from, I think it was $165 million in the first quarter down to under $50 million in the second quarter. We believe they'll stay at low levels well below 50 for the foreseeable future. So we'll no longer comment on those. And again, as I mentioned in my comments, they're related to the legacy capacity.
Sanjay Mehrotra: And regarding your question on gross margin projections for HBM, so we are not going to do that here. We are totally focused on increasing our production capability and bringing in 2025 a bit share for DRAM -- for HBM to be in line with our DRAM share. And of course, this will bring about greater profitability opportunities, but we are really not projecting pricing of HBM here in the future. But clearly, HBM brings tremendous value in the applications. You are seeing these new platforms that are hungry for more HBM, and HBM has been in shortage, and we have talked about our '24 and '25 supply being spoken for. So all of that, I think, bodes well for high revenue growth and highly profitable HBM business for us. And of course, we will stay extremely focused on maintaining discipline, maintaining our CapEx discipline and maintaining our share target discipline for HBM and really staying very disciplined on overall supply growth being in line with our DRAM share for the whole DRAM part of our business. So I think these will be key as we continue to look ahead at our execution and driving our opportunities forward.
Chris Danely: Got it. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session as well as today's program. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2024 Q1  (2023-12-20 16:30:00) =====

Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Satya. Good afternoon, everyone. In fiscal Q1, Micron delivered revenue, gross margin, and EPS above the high-end of the guidance ranges we provided at the last earnings call, reflecting Micron's strong execution combined with improved pricing. We are in the very early stages of a multi-year growth phase catalyzed and driven by generative AI, and this disruptive technology will eventually transform every aspect of business and society. Memory is at the heart of GPU-enabled AI servers, and we are already seeing strong demand driven by early deployment of AI solutions, which will only accelerate over time. Micron is well positioned to leverage this growth, having executed the most robust set of new technology and product introductions in our 45-year history. The improved supply-demand environment in the current calendar quarter gives us additional confidence in the trajectory of our business. We have driven a strong inflection in industry pricing this calendar quarter, which will allow us to benefit from higher prices earlier in our fiscal year compared to our prior plans. We intend to stay very disciplined with our supply and capacity investments as our pricing is still far from levels associated with necessary ROI. We expect our pricing to continue to strengthen through the course of calendar 2024. We expect improved margins and financial performance throughout 2024 and record industry TAM in calendar 2025. We have made significant progress with our industry-leading technology roadmap. Micron is at the forefront of ramping the industry's most advanced technology nodes in both DRAM and NAND. The vast majority of our bits are on leading-edge nodes: 1-alpha and 1-beta in DRAM and 176-layer and 232-layer in NAND. As previously stated, both 1-beta DRAM and 232-layer NAND nodes have reached mature yields faster than the prior nodes. We expect fiscal 2024 front-end cost reductions to track in line with our long-term expectations of mid- to high-single-digits in DRAM and low-teens in NAND. We are on track for volume production in 1-gamma DRAM using EUV in calendar 2025. Now turning to our end markets. Inventories for memory and storage are at or near normal levels for most customers across PC, mobile, auto, and industrial end markets. Consequently, the demand that we see from customers in these markets is closer to their end-market demand. Data center customer inventory of memory and storage is improving, and we continue to expect customer inventory to approach normal levels in this market sometime in the first half of calendar 2024. Across our data center and PC markets, we are ahead of the industry in our transition to D5 and we expect to cross over our D5 volume from D4 in early calendar 2024. Generative AI use cases are expanding from the data center to the edge, with several recent announcements of AI-enabled PCs, smartphones with on-device AI capabilities, as well as embedded AI in the auto and industrial end markets. The proliferation of on-device AI at the edge offers a host of benefits such as enhanced privacy, lower latency, improved performance, greater personalization and competitive costs for a wide range of use cases, from content creation to productivity. We see a rapid evolution in our customer product roadmaps enabling and leveraging this AI market expansion, which in turn is driving higher capacity, lower power, and increased performance requirements for memory and storage. We expect to increasingly benefit from content growth as these trends in AI gain momentum. In data center, total server unit shipments are expected to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage in calendar 2024, following a year of low-double-digit percentage decline in calendar 2023. Demand for AI servers has been strong as data center infrastructure operators shift budgets from traditional servers to more content-rich AI servers. Also, in response to AI-driven data center demand, several customers have announced aggressive roadmaps for new GPU and AI accelerator ASIC product introductions with increasing requirements for HBM capacity, performance, and power. Micron is addressing these exciting opportunities brought on by the proliferation of AI with an industry-leading portfolio of data center solutions, including HBM3E, D5, several types of high-capacity server memory modules, LPDRAM, and data center SSDs. We have received very positive customer feedback on our HBM3E, which has approximately 10% better performance and about 30% lower power consumption compared to competitive offerings of HBM3E. In fiscal Q1, we shipped samples of HBM3E to a number of key partners and are making good progress in our qualifications. Micron is in the final stages of qualifying our industry-leading HBM3E to be used in NVIDIA's next-generation Grace Hopper GH200 and H200 platforms. In addition, our LP5x is being used for the Grace CPU, driving a new use case for LP memory in the data center for accelerated computing. We are on track to begin our HBM3E volume production ramp in early calendar 2024 and to generate several hundred millions of dollars of HBM revenue in fiscal 2024. We expect continued HBM revenue growth in 2025, and we continue to expect that our HBM market share will match our overall DRAM bit share some time in calendar 2025. Last month we introduced the industry's fastest and lowest latency 128GB high-capacity modules built on our industry-leading 1-beta node and using a monolithic die, which does not require 3D stacking and thus enables a simpler process flow for assembly. Featuring best-in-class performance, our solution will support customers' memory-intensive data center workloads today and into the future. Additionally, leading CPU vendors have confirmed validation support for our monolithic-die-based 128GB modules on existing platforms released in 2022 and 2023 as well as upcoming new platforms. This ensures that our offering has a significant TAM that we can address immediately. We expect volume production to start next quarter, with significant growth in fiscal 2025 and beyond. A testament to our solid execution and superior offerings, Micron ended the third calendar quarter with record-high revenue share in data center SSDs based on independent industry assessments. This marks the second consecutive quarter of record revenue share in data center SSDs, and we look to build on this revenue momentum through fiscal 2024. In PCs, we forecast unit volumes to grow by a low- to mid-single-digit percentage in calendar 2024, after two years of double-digit percentage PC unit volume declines. We expect PC OEMs to start ramping AI-on-device PCs in the second half of calendar 2024, with an additional capacity of 4GB to 8GB of DRAM per unit, and we see average SSD capacities increasing as well. We also completed qualifications for our industry-leading 1-beta-based 16GB D5 at several PC customers in fiscal Q1. In fiscal Q1, we achieved record bit shipments in both client and consumer SSDs, as customers adopted our industry-leading solutions. Building upon our QLC leadership, our client SSD QLC bit shipments also reached a new record in fiscal Q1. QLC now comprises the majority of our bit shipment mix for both client and consumer SSD. This month, we also announced that we are shipping the Micron 3500 NVMe SSD, the world's first performance client SSD with 200 plus layer NAND. Built on our industry-leading 232-layer NAND, the 3500 will help our customers handle demanding workloads for business applications, scientific computing, gaming, and content creation. In mobile, smartphone demand is showing signs of recovery, and we forecast smartphone unit shipments to grow modestly in calendar 2024. Leading chipset vendors have announced powerful new products supporting on-device large language models with 10 billion or more parameters. We expect smartphone OEMs to start ramping AI-enabled smartphones in 2024, with an additional capacity of 4GB to 8GB of DRAM per unit. Longer-term, many popular generative AI applications will be on smartphones, and our leading product portfolio is poised to capture this memory and storage opportunity. Our new industry-leading 9.6Gbps LP5x will address the bandwidth requirements of the most demanding AI-based mobile applications. We also began sampling our next-generation 232-layer NAND UFS 3.1 and our 1-beta DRAM 24Gb LP5x to support the memory needs of emerging AI foundational models. Last, I'll cover auto and industrial, which are end markets we value as part of the portfolio due to their relatively more predictable revenue and profitability and long-term growth opportunity. The proliferation of AI at the edge continues to increase in the industrial and auto markets. For memory, this translates to content growth in a host of AI-enabled edge devices. For example, AI-enabled industrial PCs have 3x to 5x more memory than standard PCs and there is an 8x increase in memory content for AI-enabled edge video security cameras compared to standard non-AI video cameras. Our automotive business achieved a new quarterly revenue record in fiscal Q1, driven by better demand and volume ramps of new vehicle platforms. As a leader in automotive market share and quality, Micron will benefit from memory and storage content growth as automotive OEMs expand features in ADAS and in-cabin applications. Our automotive design win trajectory remains strong. Our industrial business saw double-digit sequential growth in fiscal Q1 as the industrial market continued to recover. Inventory levels for memory and storage continued to improve at distribution partners and are at normal levels at the majority of our customers. Industry fundamentals remain strong for memory and storage as the widespread adoption of IoT, AI, and machine learning solutions creates new growth opportunities for us. Now turning to our market outlook, starting with demand. We expect calendar 2023 DRAM bit demand to grow in the high-single-digit percentage range, up from prior expectations for mid-single-digit growth. In NAND, we continue to expect calendar 2023 bit demand growth in the high-teens percentage range. Looking forward, over the next few years, we expect bit demand growth CAGRs of mid-teens in DRAM and low-20s percentage range in NAND. We forecast calendar 2024 bit demand growth for the industry to be near the long-term CAGR for DRAM and somewhat below the long-term CAGR for NAND. Turning to supply, significant supply reductions across the industry have enabled the recovery that is now underway. An extended period of supply growth less than demand growth would strengthen the pace of recovery. Micron will continue to exercise supply and CapEx discipline, aligned with our strategy to maintain our long-term bit market share for DRAM and NAND. Micron's fiscal 2024 CapEx is projected to be between $7.5 billion and $8 billion, slightly higher than last year's levels and prior plans, primarily to support the HBM3E production ramp. We continue to expect WFE CapEx in fiscal 2024 to be down year-over-year. As we have discussed previously, the ramp of HBM production will constrain supply growth in non-HBM products and will help improve the overall DRAM industry supply-demand balance. Across the industry, the HBM3E die is roughly twice the size of equivalent capacity D5. Additionally, the HBM product includes a logic interface die and has a substantially more complex packaging stack that impacts yields. These factors result in HBM consuming more than 2 times the wafer supply as D5 to produce a given number of bits. In last quarter's earnings call, we communicated that we strategically diverted underutilized equipment toward ramping new technology nodes, which will help us increase leading-edge production in a capital-efficient manner. Since the number of wafer processing steps is higher for leading-edge nodes, this approach of diverting underutilized tools to the leading edge meaningfully reduces our overall wafer capacity. Thus, underutilization in our fabs early this fiscal year transitions to structurally lower wafer capacity at higher utilization rates as we move through the fiscal year. Reports indicate that this redeployment of underutilized tools at the leading edge is an industry-wide practice that is likely to constrain industry supply in 2024. Taking all these factors into account, Micron's bit supply growth in fiscal 2024 is planned to be well below demand growth for both DRAM and NAND, and we expect to decrease our days of inventory in fiscal year 2024. We expect calendar 2024 industry supply to be below demand for both DRAM and NAND, which will result in a contraction of industry inventory levels. As we have highlighted before, we continue to work with the US government and CHIPS grants are assumed in our CapEx plans for fiscal 2024. The viability and global competitiveness of our Idaho and New York projects depends on Micron receiving CHIPS grants to address the cost difference compared to overseas expansion. To better support our customers around the globe, we have opened state-of-the-art assembly and test facilities in Malaysia and Taiwan. We are proceeding with our previously announced expansion of our Xi'an facility, having received approval from Chinese authorities for our planned investment. In fiscal Q1, we achieved the first mobile customer qualification of LPDRAM assembled at our Xi'an site, furthering our strong commitment to serve our mobile customers in China. Our broad, diverse network of global operations remains a key element of our strategy to address customer demand in a reliable and resilient fashion. Our leading technology, strengthening product portfolio, strong manufacturing capabilities, and our dedicated team members position us well to capture the opportunities ahead. I will now turn it over to Mark for our financial results and outlook.
Mark Murphy: Thanks, Sanjay, and good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered strong results in fiscal Q1 with revenue, gross margin, and EPS higher than the upper end of the guidance range we provided in our last earnings call. During the quarter, an improving supply-demand environment and our team's strong execution resulted in higher prices across DRAM and NAND. The current pricing trajectory has improved our financial outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year. Total fiscal Q1 revenue was approximately $4.7 billion, up 18% sequentially and up 16% year-over-year. Fiscal Q1 DRAM revenue was $3.4 billion, representing 73% of total revenue. DRAM revenue increased 24% sequentially, with bit shipments increasing in the low-20s percentage range and prices increasing in the low-single-digit percentage range. Robust bookings entering the quarter, including customer strategic buys that occurred in prior quarters for fiscal Q1 shipment, limited our reported fiscal Q1 DRAM price increases despite Micron's strong execution on CQ4 pricing. Our strong calendar Q4 price execution contributes to our solid sequential growth in fiscal Q2, even with the effect of seasonality. Fiscal Q1 NAND revenue was $1.2 billion, representing 26% of Micron's total revenue. NAND revenue increased 2% sequentially with pricing more than offsetting an expected and communicated decline in volumes. Bit shipments declined in the mid-teens percentage range after record shipments in the prior quarter, and prices increased by approximately 20%. Portfolio mix improvements in NAND contributed to the increase. Now turning to revenue by business unit. Compute and Networking Business Unit revenue was $1.7 billion, up 45% sequentially. Data center and client shipments strengthened in the quarter. AI-related shipments increased in the data center market and normalized inventory at client customers enabled bit shipment growth. Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $1.3 billion, up 7% sequentially. Mobile revenue continued to show strength as customer inventories normalized and smartphone units and average memory and storage capacity growth at customers drove demand. Our mobile fiscal Q1 revenue almost doubled from year-ago levels. Embedded Business Unit revenue was $1 billion, up 21% sequentially. Growth was strong across most end markets. Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $653 million, down 12% sequentially due to sharply lower consumer component sales, partially offset by strong growth in SSD revenue. The consolidated gross margin for fiscal Q1 was near 1%, improving 10 percentage points sequentially and driven by higher prices and a greater mix of DRAM products. Operating expenses in fiscal Q1 were $992 million, up $150 million sequentially and in line with our late November update. OpEx increased on higher R&D expenditures and the reinstatement of certain compensation programs suspended in the prior fiscal year including short-term incentive compensation. We had an operating loss of $955 million in fiscal Q1, resulting in an operating margin of negative 20%, improved from negative 30% in the prior quarter. Fiscal Q1 taxes were $59 million, lower than the anticipated $80 million based on an updated view of projected taxes across the year, driven by our improved fiscal 2024 outlook. The non-GAAP loss per share in fiscal Q1 was $0.95 compared to a non-GAAP loss per share of $1.07 in the prior quarter and a non-GAAP loss per share of $0.04 in the year-ago quarter. Turning to cash flows and capital spending, our operating cash flows were approximately $1.4 billion in fiscal Q1 representing 30% of revenue. During the quarter, we received $600 million in customer prepayments to secure supply for leading-edge memory products. Capital expenditures were $1.7 billion during the quarter resulting in free cash flow of negative $333 million in the quarter. Our fiscal Q1 ending inventory was $8.3 billion or 159 days, down from 170 days in the prior quarter. As mentioned in prior quarters, we hold strategic inventory stock associated with build ahead of products for cost optimization and risk mitigation. Excluding strategic stock, our fiscal Q1 ending inventory days would be approximately 142 days, only 22 days higher than our target inventory level. On the balance sheet, we held $9.8 billion of cash and investments at quarter end and maintained $12.3 billion of liquidity when including our untapped credit facility. We ended the quarter with $13.5 billion in total debt, low net leverage, and a weighted average maturity on our debt of 2030. Now turning to our outlook for the fiscal second quarter. While we remain mindful of macroeconomic risks, the memory and storage market environment is improving. We expect supply-demand balance to tighten in both DRAM and NAND throughout 2024. Our leading-edge DRAM and NAND nodes are oversubscribed for the full year. Consequently, we expect prices to increase through calendar 2024, driving improvements in our financial performance. Our leading-edge inventory is very tight, and we are also working to minimize pull-in of customer demand in response to higher pricing. As a result, our sequential growth in the near term will be driven primarily by pricing rather than a sequential increase in bit shipments. Both DRAM and NAND bit shipments are expected to decline somewhat in the fiscal second quarter. We expect our fiscal Q2 gross margin to benefit from sequential price increases and reduced impact from underutilization. We project the balance of previously written-down inventories to clear in fiscal Q2. We forecast operating expenses to decline in the fiscal second quarter on lower R&D program expenses and an asset sale previously expected to occur in the first quarter. For the fiscal year, due to some higher R&D expenses including what we saw in Q1 and higher short-term incentive compensation from an improved outlook, we now project OpEx to be over $3.9 billion. We forecast a much reduced operating loss in fiscal Q2 and project a return to operating income in Q3. Our tax forecast for the year has increased from under $200 million to over $300 million based on an updated taxable income outlook. We project the allocation of tax expense across the year to be heaviest in the fourth quarter driven by profitability and other factors. As we've mentioned previously, at current levels of profitability, tax estimates and the distribution of taxes across the year are highly sensitive to changes in the outlook. We plan fiscal Q2 capital expenditures to be in line with first quarter levels. We see operating cash flows improving substantially in the second-half of the fiscal year and are now forecasting positive free cash flow in the fiscal fourth quarter. With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for fiscal Q2 is as follows. We expect revenue to be $5.3 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in the range of 13%, plus or minus 150 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $950 million, plus or minus $15 million. We expect tax expenses of approximately $45 million. Based on a share count of approximately 1.1 billion shares, we expect a loss of $0.28 per share, plus or minus $0.07. In closing, the industry environment is improving, and our financial outlook has strengthened for the fiscal year and beyond. We will continue to take a disciplined approach to managing the business and remain focused on optimizing price, driving productivity, and controlling capital spend. With high levels of liquidity and low net leverage, we continue to operate from a position of balance sheet strength as we forecast a return to profitability and positive free cash flow. I will now turn it back over to Sanjay.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Mark. Over the last year, our world-class technology, business, and manufacturing teams ensured ongoing leadership in foundational memory technologies and the expansion of our industry-leading product portfolio. We are encouraged by the progress we have made on pricing, and we are on track to restore profitability more commensurate with the great value our solutions provide to our customers. We expect 2024 to be a year of recovery and can see the path towards a healthy supply-demand environment along with strong growth in critical new technologies like HBM3E. From the data center to the edge, AI has emerged as a significant secular driver that will further bolster the industry towards record revenue TAM in 2025 and drive growth for years to come. Micron's broad and growing suite of leading-edge products positions us well to capitalize on the immense opportunities ahead. Thank you for joining us today. We will now open for questions.
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Your question, please.
Krish Sankar: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Sanjay or Mark, the first question I had is kind of you spoke about sustainability of pricing in calendar '24. I'm kind of curious if you can peel the onion one layer below and say how we think about pricing through calendar '24 for DRAM and NAND, and if you can extrapolate it into 2025, that'll be very helpful. And then I had a follow-up.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thanks, Krish for the question. And with respect to the pricing, we of course expect pricing to continue to strengthen during calendar 2024. And this is because of the healthy demand-supply balance as we discussed in the context of our script. As you have seen, there have been significant cuts in supply growth in the industry. Customer inventories have normalized, supplier inventories are improving, as we have discussed our own inventory here as well. And pricing will continue to improve as a result through the course of the year. And of course, you know, the demand trends overall, because of improvement of customer inventories are in PCs, in smartphones, automotive and industrial, the demand trend will continue. And in sometime in first half of '24, calendar '24, we expect data center inventories at customers to get normalized as well. And beyond that point, we would expect data center to become another boost in demand in 2024. So we expect pricing to continue to increase both in NAND and in DRAM as well. And we expect a healthy demand-supply environment in 2025 as well as a healthy pricing environment in '25 too. And I just want to point out that as we noted, we have tightness on our leading-edge nodes. They are already in short supply and inventories will continue to improve for us. And all of this results in overall healthy dynamics for pricing improvements, profitability improvements, and revenue opportunity growth in the backdrop of demand drivers, AI being a dominant demand driver across the end markets.
Krish Sankar: Got it. That's very helpful, Sanjay. And then just a quick follow-up on CapEx. I understand a lot of the CapEx is going towards HBM and WFE is going to be down year-over-year. Is there a way of quantifying how much of the CapEx for next year is for HBM? And at -- what is the catalyst for you to start investing in NAND? Is it price? Is it gross margin? Any such catalyst for NAND. That'd be very helpful. Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So we are not breaking down the CapEx, you know, between HBM and other parts of the business, but we have noted that our WFE is down, and of course, we are very much focused on supporting the growth of our HBM business. We are very excited about our leading-edge product, HBM3E, which is the most advanced HBM3E offering in the industry. And we are -- as we noted in our remarks, post the qualification, you know, we are going to be starting production ramp early in calendar '24 and driving revenue growth will be more back half loaded for us. So -- I mean, we will of course make the necessary investments to support the demand for our HBM in '24. I would just point out that our HBM supply is basically in calendar year '24 is sold out at this point. And, you know, in terms of, you know, NAND and CapEx, whether in NAND or in DRAM, what's most important is that the profitability returns to the levels that are really needed in order to justify ROI in increasing any CapEx investments. So this is what we are focused on and we'll remain extremely disciplined with respect to any CapEx, with respect to any supply growth considerations. And you know that the profitability in the industry is still far from the levels that are needed to get ROI on the investments and we plan to remain extremely disciplined in this regard.
Krish Sankar: Thanks, Sanjay.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I have two as well, real quick. You know, first, building on the HBM comment that you're basically sold out for the year. I know that you referenced in your prepared remarks that you're qualified in with the GH200 and the H200 at NVIDIA. I'm just curious, when you get qual-ed in on HBM3E, you know, how does that market work in terms of -- you know, do these customers dual qualify? Do you have line of sight and kind of your share position within those product SKUs? I'm just curious of how the qualifications work and the visibility that you have to basically kind of, you know, double down on the fact that you expect to be kind of, you know, comparable market share in HBM as DRAM in total as you look out into '25.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So our product is in qualification, as we noted in our comments here, and qualification is progressing well. And post qualification, we expect to be ramping production volumes as well as shipments to our customers. And that's what will yield to several hundred millions of dollars of revenue for us in fiscal year '24. Again, that revenue will be more back half of our fiscal year, more so in the back half. But that volume ramp and that revenue opportunity will continue to build up as we go into '25. It will continue to increase in our fiscal year as well as calendar year '25. And as we have said that sometime in calendar year '25, we expect to be able to get to a level of our share in the HBM market that would align with our share in DRAM. So this is an exciting opportunity for us. And as you know, HBM is higher revenue per gigabyte. It is also higher profitability per gigabyte. So this is -- and it's one of the biggest growth markets in memory today. So we are excited about this opportunity. And of course, you know, there's a very tight relationship, tight integration with customers for quals on HBM. And it takes longer than standard products. And, you know, these are all factors that will play a role in terms of, you know, the number of suppliers that customers would tend to have for any given platform for HBM.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. And then as a quick follow-up, I'm curious, in the comment you had said that basically your leading-edge inventory was very tight. And I think the follow-up comment was that you're really, you know, focusing on minimizing any pull-in in the midst of, you know, pricing increases materializing. Can you just help us appreciate what exactly you're able to do to minimize any pull-in or the visibility you have in whether any customers are taking strategic inventory? Just curious how you manage that.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So with respect to strategic inventory, I think we had discussed in the past that we had made certain strategic -- certain customers had built certain strategic purchases in our FQ4 time frame and those are completing in CQ4 here. And of course, as we look ahead, we are very much focused on, you know, managing our supply, managing our demand. Pricing environment is increasing and we want to in this environment, of course, make sure that we meet the requirements of our customers in a fashion that overall maintains, you know, healthy dynamics of our business. Beyond that, I don't think we are in a position to discuss further specifics here.
Aaron Rakers: Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.
Toshiya Hari: Hi. Good afternoon. I had two questions as well. One on gross margins, maybe for Mark, and then my follow-up is for Sanjay. Mark, so the gross margin profile is improving from, you know, breakeven or 1% in the prior quarter to 13%. I was hoping you could sort of break that down, the sequential change for us in terms of pricing, I guess lower underutilization charges, and whatever else is happening from an inventory perspective. And beyond Feb, as we sort of look out into May, you talked about pricing improving throughout '24, so that continues to be a tailwind. How should we think about some of the other dynamics that go into your gross margin math?
Mark Murphy: Sure. Excuse me. So on the fourth quarter to the first quarter gross margin, you know, we were up 10 points over half, or about half of that was price. Most of the remainder was mix on the higher DRAM volumes. And then we did see some favorable cost. We had the lower-cost inventories clear at $600 million and then we had some reduced idle charges that we've talked about. Now, if we move out to second quarter, as we mentioned, we're not seeing volume growth in the second quarter, but we are seeing gross margins still up 12 points. So it's all driven by price, or principally price. There is some mix shift within, you know, by customers and some seasonal effects, but again, it's largely a price-driven increase. You know, while we have lower benefits from the low-cost inventory clearing, we'll have $400 million clear or $400 million of benefit in the second quarter when we had $600 million in the first quarter. We are seeing some cost declines occurring with the increase of leading node production, and then again with the lower wafer starts and the higher utilization. What we've talked about before, we start to see idle charges dropping, as we've discussed. So again, principally price in the second quarter, but then beginning to see some cost benefits, even though we're losing the benefit of that lower cost inventory. We will see price appreciation through the year. We're going to -- we don't expect there to be volume growth in the third quarter either, but good price appreciation, which will drive gross margins up. And then in the fourth quarter, we would expect to see volume and price, and again some lower utilization charges. So again, we would expect to see margin expansion second quarter to third quarter, and then again third quarter to fourth quarter.
Toshiya Hari: Okay. Great. That's super helpful. And then, as my follow-up for Sanjay, you know, you guys had presented a, you know, cross-cycle financial model at your Investor Day, I think it was last May. Clearly, the environment has changed quite a bit. But when you sort of, you know, talk about necessary ROI for your business, as you guys debate when to increase production, when to increase CapEx, should we look at the model from last May still as a reference point, you know, through cycle operating margins of 30%, free cash flow margins of 10% or higher? Is that still the model that's relevant in your view, or have things changed since? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Yes, that model is very much relevant once we get past this downturn and the recovery from this downturn as well. And I think we just have to recognize that this downturn has been steep. This has been driven by once in 100 year pandemic as well as all the other related factors which we have talked about, customer inventories and demand pull-in and demand normalization and all other things that have impacted -- severely impacted the industry environment over the course of last year. 2024, we'll be recovering and we have called it the year of recovery. And we have talked about how we see pricing continuing to increase through the year and of course, profitability continuing to improve through the year as well. As we look past this recovery, we would definitely say that cross-cycle model that we have discussed in the past definitely would hold and that's what we target for.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I had a question on these prepays that you're getting. That's $600 million. That's a pretty big number. So is that more of a one-time deal or should we expect these, you know, prepays to continue? And as part of that, is that mostly related to say HBM or a particular vertical like data center or is that across, you know, most of your end markets? And then I had a follow-up as well.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So obviously, due to the confidential nature of this agreement, we cannot provide any specifics around these prepayments. But what I would like to point out is that it does reflect the importance of our technology, our products, and our delivery capabilities. It also reflects our close relationships with our partners and, you know, commitment from both sides from our -- a good example of commitment from customers as well as from Micron. Beyond that, I'm not able to really provide any specifics here. And again, honoring the confidentiality.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay. Okay, got that. I guess then can you talk, Sanjay, just about limiting the bit shipments? I think you said you're limiting the bit shipments to prevent pull-ins ahead of price increases. Sounds like bits are flat sequentially for fiscal Q2 and fiscal Q3. Can you talk about the logistics of that? Are you just kind of holding back on volumes to regain some, you know, pricing leverage? I guess if your competitors don't match that approach, you might risk losing some shares. So can you just talk about the logistics of that? Thanks.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Well, as we noted that leading-edge supply is already tight. And, you know, so that, you know, certainly impacts in our FQ2, some of the shipments. FQ2, of course, is also impacted by seasonality. And -- so supply is -- managing supply, given the tight environment of supply on the leading nodes, is really the main consideration in terms of us guiding you to this profile. And of course, as we manage, as we allocate that supply across the customers, we want to make sure that we are managing our shipments to our customers carefully.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna Financial. Your question, please.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Two follow ups. Sanjay, historically, memory industry tends to gravitate towards higher-margin products, which has historically led to margin erosion. Why is HBM any different? And what are your thoughts? Anything you can share with us as to what can preserve the higher margin associated with these high-end products? And I have a follow-up.
Sanjay Mehrotra: I think, you know, AI is in very early innings. Gen AI is barely starting and these are great growth opportunities ahead. You know, this is, you know, biggest revolution since Internet and recently you have heard industry estimates of data center AI accelerator TAM CAGR of being about 70% over the course of next few years. Of course, as those opportunities grow with data center accelerators, you know, from various suppliers, of course, the whole infrastructure grows and it's about AI and Gen AI applications from training to inferencing and really proliferating all across, you know, the data center environment. And that's where -- and along with the growth in data center AI accelerators, the rest of the infrastructure, including HBM, will continue to grow. So we project that HBM CAGR will be over 50% over the course of next few years. And when you think about it, that is more than 3 times of the DRAM industry CAGR that we are talking about. And still, we are in the very, very early innings. 2023 is the first year of meaningful shipments of HBM in the industry and that too corresponds to low-single-digit percentage in terms of bits shipped in HBM this year, but much higher pricing, much higher revenue opportunity. So as we look ahead, we see HBM continuing to grow strongly in the industry. Its demand will grow. It will be a key enabler of Gen AI applications in training as well as inferencing because more and more data is required. As you look at more and more, larger and larger large language models, and more training on more data just drives more demand for high bandwidth, high performance, low power memory. So this is the very beginning. It has long ways to go. And the other important factor with HBM, as we have discussed is, that it really takes more than 2 times as many wafers to produce the same number of bits as D5. So it really has -- it is a headwind to the supply growth in the DRAM industry and it has the effect of helping strengthen the supply-demand balance of the industry as well. So I think these are, you know, some of the important aspects. Of course, when -- so important thing is that this has to be looked at as a long-term opportunity, long-term growth opportunity. And of course, you know, we are excited about getting our HBM share to align with our DRAM share some time in 2025. And of course, as we look at any large opportunity, you know, over time, it will certainly have some ebb and flow in terms of demand and supply and we will prudently manage this. And maintaining flexibility in managing this is absolutely key. And you have seen us manage this well over time in our overall industry for DRAM as well as for NAND on part of Micron, and we'll continue to manage it in that fashion. It is an exciting opportunity. We are well positioned with our product and we look forward to continuing to grow revenue and profit contribution with this product line over the course of next few years.
Mehdi Hosseini: Great. Thanks for detail. Just a quick follow-up for Mark. Is there a normalized capital intensity that we should think of, especially as we come off this kind of nuclear winter in memory? Is there any -- if you don't have a normalized capital intensity, what else out there that could help us better forecast free cash flows?
Mark Murphy: Yes, no update, Mehdi, to the cross-cycle model that we've provided. So I think the best way to think about CapEx is just over time as a percent of revenue, which we've given mid 30s percent over time. Of course, you know, for example, HBM, you know, requires more CapEx, but it also yields a price premium and accretive margin. So we believe that at this time that capital intensity model that we've provided before is still intact.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. As you mentioned, your leading-edge DRAM and NAND supply output is oversubscribed for the full year. Does you factor in your CapEx plans, conversion of capacity from mature nodes to leading-edge nodes? When do you guys see your ability to fully supply to your customers' demand profile? Is that looking more likely now calendar year '25 and what end markets or applications are you seeing the largest demand-supply gap as you move through the fiscal year?
Sanjay Mehrotra: As we move through the fiscal year, of course, you know, leading-edge nodes being in tight supply. You know, leading-edge nodes are, you know, driver of demand in PCs and smartphones and data center applications and we have a strong portfolio that is well positioned with these nodes. And -- so -- I mean, basically, this is important for us to maintain the supply discipline and we -- industry is still not at the profitability levels for investments to be made and we'll manage our supply very, very prudently as we work ahead. And of course, we'll continue to focus on driving the pricing as well as driving the profitability of our business to bring in return on investments on our CapEx that is needed and do our best to manage and allocate the demand across our end markets and customers.
Harlan Sur: Great. Thanks for that. And again, you mentioned this briefly in your prepared remarks, but if you look at some of the third-party research estimates, September quarter was the second consecutive quarter where the team had, I think, somewhere about 10% to 12% market share in data center NVMe SSDs. If I look back historically, like your share has been more in the sort of 3% to 5% range. So obviously strong recent market share performance. You've got a strong lineup of data center SSDs. What's been the big differentiator for the team here and how do you guys continue to grow your share going forward?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So thank you for acknowledging that. I mean, our team has done a great job with data center SSD product portfolio over the course of the years and now we have a strong set of product offerings for, you know, data center SSDs, NVMe SSDs and we now achieved record data center market share in SSDs for two consecutive quarters. And for the calendar Q3, our data center SSD share now is in line with our NAND share in the industry. And this is really the benefit, and you're seeing the full benefit, the full power of vertical integration playing out here where our team has worked together from device to design to firmware to system implementation to understanding of customer application, working closely with customers in qualifications and really across a wide range of customers over course of time, have really developed very robust industry-leading, strong product portfolio with greater opportunities ahead as well. So, this is the transformation that we began to drive in the company, going from selling components in the past to value-add solutions and really very pleased how data center SSD recognition is being provided to our team in terms of revenue opportunities by our customers and, you know, certainly reflected in the share gains that we have made in this market. And of course, another big factor that has been a key contributor to the success here is you may recall we transitioned some time ago from floating gate to replacement gate technology in NAND and that has definitely been a key factor. Strong, successful, timely execution on that has played an important role in our data center SSD strength. So we are very excited about Micron's market position in this market and our future opportunities here.
Harlan Sur: Thank you, Sanjay.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session as well as today's program. Thank you, everyone, for participating in today's program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2023 Q4  (2023-09-27 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing. Welcome to Micron's Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Samir Patodia, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Samir Patodia: Thank you, and welcome to Micron Technology's fiscal fourth quarter 2023 financial conference call. On the call with me today are Sanjay Mehrotra, our President and CEO, and Mark Murphy, our CFO. Today's call is being webcast from our Investor Relations site at investors.micron.com, including audio and slides.

We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results. I'll now turn the call over to Sanjay.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Samir. Good afternoon, everyone. In fiscal Q4, Micron delivered revenue and gross margin above the midpoint of our guidance, with EPS above the high end of the range. These results reflect our strong execution, and we are well-positioned to drive significant improvements in our financial performance. We believe pricing has now bottomed. Ongoing demand growth, customer inventory normalization, and industry-wide supply reductions have set the stage for increased revenue, along with improved pricing and profitability throughout fiscal 2024. We continue to expect record industry TAM in calendar 2025 with more normalized levels of profitability. Fiscal 2023 was a challenging year for the memory and storage industry as the revenue TAM reached a multiyear low, resulting in a significant impact to financial performance. Despite this difficult backdrop, the Micron team stayed focused on our strategy, executed well and accomplished several important milestones. We achieved record annual automotive revenue, record NAND QLC bit shipments for the full fiscal year, and reached record levels in calendar Q2 for revenue share in data center and client SSDs. We were the first in our industry to introduce 1-beta DDR5 and LP5X DRAM products and the first to ship HBM3E samples with industry-leading performance and power efficiency. We were also the first to introduce 232-layer NAND SSD products in data center, client and consumer markets. These accomplishments were underpinned by our leadership technology and continued strong progress in manufacturing execution. We achieved world-class mature yields in record time on our industry-leading 1-beta DRAM and 232-layer NAND technologies. In addition, Micron took several prudent and timely actions to reduce our CapEx and supply in order to address the market imbalances through the course of fiscal 2023. Our industry-leading technology roadmap continues to progress well. As we have mentioned before, the vast majority of our bits are on leading-edge nodes 1-alpha and 1-beta in DRAM and 176-layer and 232-layer in NAND. We continue to make good progress on 1-gamma DRAM development using EUV and are on track for production in calendar 2025. Development of our next-generation NAND node is also well on track. Now turning to our end markets. Customers continued to reduce their excess inventory for memory and storage in fiscal Q4. Most customer inventories for memory and storage in the PC and smartphone markets are now at normal levels, consistent with our prior forecasts. Inventory levels are normal across most customers in the automotive market as well. Data center customer inventory is also improving and will likely normalize in early calendar 2024. Consequently, we see demand continuing to strengthen, which has led to an inflection in pricing. Some customers have made strategic purchases in DRAM and NAND to take advantage of unsustainably low pricing as the market begins its recovery. In data center, traditional server demand remains lackluster while demand for AI servers has been strong. Data center infrastructure operators have shifted budgets from traditional servers to higher-priced AI servers. Total server unit shipments are expected to decline in calendar 2023, the first year-over-year decline since 2016. We expect total server unit growth will resume in calendar 2024 to help fulfill ever-increasing workload demand. We also expect content growth in both AI and traditional servers. Compared to traditional servers, AI training servers contain significantly higher DRAM and NAND content with greater technology complexity, robust product value and higher profitability. We believe our data center revenue has bottomed, and we expect growth in fiscal Q1 and increasing momentum through fiscal years '24 and '25 in our data center business. Micron has a strengthening portfolio of solutions optimized for bandwidth, capacity and power. These include HBM3E, DDR5 and associated high-capacity modules, LPDRAM, and data center SSDs. This portfolio of industry-leading products positions us well to capture the opportunities presented by data-centric computing architectures and AI. The introduction of our HBM3E product offering has been met with strong customer interest and enthusiasm. Our HBM3E provides superior bandwidth, power and capacity for generative AI workloads. We developed this industry-leading design using our 1-beta technology, advanced TSV, and other innovations that enable a differentiated packaging solution. We have been working closely with our customers throughout the development process and are becoming a closely integrated partner in their AI roadmaps. Micron HBM3E is currently in qualification for NVIDIA compute products, which will drive HBM3E-powered AI solutions. We expect to begin the production ramp of HBM3E in early calendar 2024 and to achieve meaningful revenues in fiscal 2024. Micron also has a strong position in the industry transition to D5. We expect Micron D5 volume to cross over D4 in early calendar 2024, ahead of the industry. We expanded our high-capacity D5 DRAM module portfolio with a monolithic die-based 128 gigabyte module, and we have started shipping samples to customers to help support their AI application needs. We expect revenue from this product in Q2 of calendar 2024. Last month, we announced the introduction of 128 gigabyte and 256 gigabyte CXL 2.0 memory expansion modules. By leveraging a unique dual-channel memory architecture, we are able to deliver higher module capacity and increased bandwidth. We have shipped samples to several customers and key partners. In data center SSDs, Micron's entire portfolio utilizes 176-layer or 232-layer NAND in production, a testament to our product and technology leadership. We are well-positioned to serve the growing demand for fast storage as data-intensive AI applications proliferate. We saw strong demand for our data center NVMe SSDs across our AI-focused, industry-leading 30-terabyte product, as well as for our mainstream products. Micron ended the second calendar quarter with record high revenue share in data center SSDs, based on independent industry assessments. We expect to build on this momentum in fiscal 2024. In PCs, we continue to forecast calendar 2023 PC unit volume to decline by a low double-digit percentage year-over-year and then grow by a low to mid-single-digit percentage in calendar 2024. AI-enabled PCs will drive content growth and an improved refresh cycle over the next two years. In fiscal Q4, we saw strong sequential bit shipment growth at PC OEMs driven by demand for LPDRAM in thin client notebooks. We expect to begin revenue shipments of our industry-leading 1-beta-based client D5 in fiscal Q1 to PC OEMs. According to third-party analysts, in calendar Q2, we reached record revenue share in client SSDs for PC OEMs as customers adopted our industry-leading solutions. Our 232-layer NVMe client SSD is now qualified at large OEMs and shipping in volume production. Our SSD QLC bit shipment mix reached a new record for the second consecutive quarter, with growth in both client and consumer markets. We continue to expand our footprint in the high-end consumer SSD space with the launch of three new products that extend our reach into professional content creators and enthusiast PC gamers. In mobile, we expect calendar 2023 smartphone unit volume to be down by a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year and then grow by a mid-single-digit percentage in calendar 2024. Elasticity, along with a mix shift toward premium phones with greater capacity, is contributing to memory content growth. About a third of smartphones sold today have at least 8 gigabyte of DRAM and 256 gigabyte of NAND, up more than 7 percentage points versus smartphone units a year ago. Similar to our view on PCs, AI-enabled mobile phones could drive content growth and a stronger refresh cycle over time. Longer term, we see generative AI applications executing on handsets. These applications will continue to drive new requirements for higher capacity, lower power and increased performance in memory and storage. Last, I'll cover the auto and industrial end markets, which contribute to more stable revenue and profitability. Fiscal 2023 marked another record revenue year for our automotive business. Micron continues to lead in automotive market share and quality. Long term, we expect memory and storage content per vehicle to increase in both ADAS and in-cabin applications. In addition, fast-growing EVs typically contain higher memory and storage content. Our automotive design win trajectory remains strong. The industrial market showed signs of recovery in fiscal Q4. Inventory levels for memory and storage are stabilizing at distribution partners and at the majority of our customers. We expect the volume recovery that we observed in the second half of fiscal 2023 to continue into 2024. We see strong growth prospects in this market over time, as industrial customers continue to adopt and implement the IoT, AI and machine learning solutions. As previously discussed, the CAC or Cybersecurity Administration of China decision earlier this year has impacted our business, particularly in the domestic data center and networking markets in China. We remain committed to serving our customers in China for those areas of their business not impacted by the CAC decision. While there is near-term impact to our demand due to these challenges in China, we remain focused on maintaining Micron's global market share. Our team's grit and Micron's deep relationships with our customers, underpinned by our technology leadership, increasing product momentum, excellent product quality, and extensive manufacturing and supply chain capabilities position us well toward these goals. Now, turning to our market outlook, starting with demand. We expect calendar 2023 DRAM bit demand to grow in the mid-single-digit percentage range. In NAND, our expectations for demand growth this calendar year have increased from high-single digits to high teens percentage. These are below the expected long-term bit demand growth CAGRs of mid-teens in DRAM and low-20s percentage range in NAND. While calendar 2023 DRAM demand has been in line with expectations, NAND growth expectations have increased due to stronger than expected demand in certain parts of the consumer market and a trend of greater elasticity in per unit content. While macroeconomic factors remain a risk, we expect robust year-over-year bit demand growth in calendar 2024 for both DRAM and NAND, driven by improving end-market demand, normalized customer inventory levels, content growth across products, and ongoing growth in AI. Calendar 2024 bit demand growth is expected to exceed the long-term CAGR for DRAM and to be near the long-term CAGR for NAND. Turning to supply. Significant supply and CapEx reductions across the industry have helped to stabilize the market and are enabling the recovery that is now underway. We see both DRAM and NAND year-over-year supply growth in calendar 2023 to be negative for the industry. We expect Micron's year-on-year bit supply growth to be meaningfully negative for DRAM. We also expect to produce fewer NAND bits in calendar 2023 than in calendar 2022. In calendar 2024, we expect industry DRAM and NAND supply growth to be below industry demand growth and meaningfully so for DRAM. We believe calendar 2024 is positioned to be a year of recovery in the memory and storage industry. A sustained period of supply growth less than demand growth will strengthen the pace of recovery. HBM production will be a headwind to industry bit supply growth. Across the industry, the HBM3E die is roughly twice the size of equivalent-capacity D5. The HBM product includes a logic interface die and has a substantially more complex packaging stack that impacts yields. As a result, HBM3 and 3E demand will absorb an outsized portion of industry wafer supply. The ramp of HBM3 and 3E production will reduce overall DRAM bit supply growth industry-wide with particular supply impact on non-HBM products as more capacity is diverted to addressing HBM opportunities. Micron is experiencing a similar impact of our planned HBM3E ramp on our bit supply capability. Micron's bit supply growth in fiscal 2024 is planned to be well below demand growth for both DRAM and NAND, and we expect to decrease our days of inventory in fiscal 2024. We continue to execute to our strategy of maintaining global bit shipment market share for DRAM and NAND while sustaining tight supply and CapEx management discipline. Micron's fiscal 2024 CapEx is projected to be up slightly compared to fiscal 2023 levels. WFE CapEx will be down again year-over-year in fiscal 2024. We remain focused on carefully managing overall supply growth. In last quarter's earnings call, we communicated that total wafer start reductions in both DRAM and NAND are approaching 30% versus peak 2022 levels. Amid an intense focus on capital efficiency over the last few quarters, we have redeployed a portion of the underutilized equipment to support production ramp of leading-edge nodes in both DRAM and NAND. Given the higher process step count of these leading-edge nodes, transitioning this equipment results in a significant and structural reduction to our overall wafer capacity in both DRAM and NAND. Due to this structural reduction in capacity, our DRAM and NAND wafer starts will remain significantly below 2022 levels for the foreseeable future. Our industry supply projections assume a similar structural reduction in wafer capacity industrywide. Lead times to increase this wafer capacity will be long and will depend on improving demand, pricing and financial performance. We expect underutilization to continue in our legacy nodes well into calendar 2024. We see our demand at leading-edge nodes exceeding our supply in fiscal and calendar 2024, particularly in the second half of the year. Construction CapEx will be elevated to support our plans to build leading-edge memory fabs in Idaho and New York, for which we filed CHIPS applications in August. As we have highlighted before, the requested level of CHIPS grants for our Idaho and New York projects are essential to the viability and global competitiveness of each of these projects. Our CapEx plans assume that a certain level of CHIPS grant funds will be made available to us in fiscal year 2024. Assembly and Test CapEx is projected to double year-over-year in fiscal 2024, predominantly driven by investments to support HBM3E production. Our planned fiscal 2024 CapEx investments in HBM capacity have substantially increased versus our prior plan in response to strong customer demand for our industry-leading product. Over the course of calendar 2024, we see accelerating AI-driven opportunities for memory and storage across multiple market segments from the data center to the edge. We are encouraged by the improving industry demand and supply fundamentals. We believe that the CapEx constraints created by the industry profitability environment, coupled with improved inventories, announced supply reductions and the impact of the HBM ramp on DRAM bit supply growth will create conditions that will increasingly tighten the supply-demand balance, particularly in the second half of our fiscal year. Our Micron team is executing well and they are taking prudent and proactive actions to navigate through the near-term environment and position the company to emerge stronger from the current downturn. We look forward to a recovery in our business financials taking shape in fiscal 2024. I will now turn it over to Mark for our financial results and outlook.
Mark Murphy: Thanks, Sanjay, and good afternoon, everyone. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, Micron delivered revenue and gross margin higher than the midpoint of the guidance range and EPS above the high end of the range. We are exiting the fiscal year with the business improving due to multiple factors including higher volumes, an inflection in the pricing environment, strong productivity and ongoing capital discipline. Total fiscal Q4 revenue was approximately $4 billion, up 7% sequentially and down 40% year-over-year. Fiscal 2023 total revenue was $15.5 billion, down 49% year-over-year. Fiscal Q4 DRAM revenue was $2.8 billion, representing 69% of total revenue. DRAM revenue increased 3% sequentially, with bit shipments increasing in the mid-teens percentage range and prices declining in the high-single-digit percentage range. For the fiscal year, DRAM revenue declined 51% year-over-year to $11 billion, representing 71% of total revenue. Fiscal Q4 NAND revenue was $1.2 billion, representing around 30% of Micron's total revenue. NAND revenue increased 19% sequentially, with bit shipments increasing over 40% driven by timing of shipments including strategic purchases and prices declining in the mid-teens percentage range. For the fiscal year, NAND revenue declined 46% year-over-year to $4.2 billion, representing 27% of total revenue. Now turning to revenue by business unit. Compute and Networking Business Unit revenue was $1.2 billion, down 14% sequentially. Data center revenue remained weak as customers continued to adjust inventories and as a result of the CAC decision. In fiscal Q1, we expect sequential growth in data center. Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $1.2 billion, up 48% sequentially due to seasonal effects and timing of shipments. Embedded Business Unit revenue was $860 million, down 6% sequentially. Embedded Consumer revenue increased sequentially, helped by seasonality while automotive and industrial revenue declined modestly. Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $739 million, up 18% sequentially and driven by increased shipments across most of the product portfolio. SBU bit shipments set records for fiscal Q4 and the fiscal year. The consolidated gross margin for fiscal Q4 was negative 9%, improving seven percentage points sequentially. Gross margin was impacted by lower pricing and underutilization costs, while the sell through of previously written-down inventory provided some uplift. For the fiscal year, consolidated gross margin was negative 8%, down 54 percentage points year-over-year driven by price effects, inventory write-downs and the burden of underutilization. Approximately six percentage points of the reduction is from net inventory write-downs. Operating expenses in fiscal Q4 were $842 million, down $24 million sequentially due to ongoing expense-reduction initiatives and the timing of certain R&D program expenditures. For the fiscal year, operating expenses were $3.6 billion, down $209 million year-over-year driven by expense-reduction initiatives. On OpEx for the fourth quarter and year, we ended below the target we communicated starting with our September call a year ago. As market conditions improve, we will remain disciplined in all spending, including operating expenses, focusing R&D on the most critical programs and leveraging a competitive and more productive overhead structure. We had an operating loss of roughly $1.2 billion in fiscal Q4, resulting in an operating margin of negative 30%, improved from negative 39% in the prior quarter. Fiscal 2023 operating loss was $4.8 billion, resulting in an operating margin of negative 31%. We recorded a tax benefit of $14 million in fiscal Q4, better than expectations and due primarily to lower than expected foreign taxes related to currency effects. For fiscal 2023, total taxes were $142 million. The non-GAAP loss per share in fiscal Q4 was $1.07, compared to a loss per share of $1.43 in the prior quarter and earnings per share of $1.45 in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was a loss per share of $4.45 for the fiscal year. Turning to cash flows and capital spending. Our operating cash flows were approximately $250 million in fiscal Q4. For the fiscal year, we generated $1.6 billion of cash from operations representing 10% of revenue. Capital expenditures were $1 billion during the quarter and totaled $7 billion for the fiscal year. This was in line with recent guidance, and for the year, at the low end of the range of estimates we provided on our December 2022 earnings call. Free cash flow was negative $758 million in the quarter. Our fiscal Q4 ending inventory was $8.4 billion or 170 days. As mentioned last quarter, we are holding approximately $1 billion of strategic inventory stock associated with build ahead of products for cost optimization and risk mitigation. We see days of inventory improving into the first half of the fiscal year and, adjusting for this strategic stock, expect to have only a few weeks of above target inventories as we enter the second half of fiscal 2024. Inventory levels and profitability will remain principal factors in our decisions around wafer starts and capacity planning. Continuing with the balance sheet, we maintained historically high levels of liquidity. At year-end, we held $10.5 billion of cash and investments and had $13 billion of liquidity when including our untapped credit facility. We ended the year with $13.3 billion in total debt, a weighted average maturity of 2030 on debt, and low net leverage. Now turning to our outlook for the fiscal first quarter. Demand is improving as customer inventory levels continue to normalize and secular growth drivers remain intact. We expect record DRAM bit shipments in fiscal Q1. For NAND, we expect fiscal Q1 bit shipments to decline somewhat from fiscal Q4 levels but remain relatively strong. In China, the Cyberspace Administration of China decision continues to impact our revenue opportunity, and the associated headwind is reflected in our guidance. Fiscal Q1 gross margin is projected to improve sequentially on a greater mix of DRAM and more sell-through of written-down inventories. We expect approximately 60% of the remaining benefit from lower cost inventories to clear in fiscal Q1. Our gross margin guidance does not contemplate any additional inventory write-downs due to pricing. Period costs associated with underutilization will weigh on gross margins in the quarter, as first quarter period costs are projected to be similar to the prior quarter. Beyond fiscal Q1, we project gross margin improvement to continue as prices increase and period costs become less of a factor. We expect the rate of price improvement in the second fiscal half to exceed the first half. We now forecast gross margins to be positive throughout the second half of fiscal 2024. As mentioned last quarter, we expect fiscal Q1 operating expenses to increase sequentially, driven by an increase in R&D and as temporary reductions to employee compensation come to an end. For the full fiscal year 2024, we expect operating expenses to be up by a low-single-digit percentage versus fiscal 2023. On taxes, we project a material sequential quarterly increase as we move from a credit in Q4 to a more normal expense. As discussed previously, though overall profitability remains low, a minimum level of taxes will occur based primarily on local jurisdiction profit. As we are forecasting a consolidated pretax loss in fiscal 2024, these local factors will drive tax expense again this year. We estimate our full-year fiscal 2024 taxes to be under $200 million. A first quarter tax estimate of $80 million reflects our forecasted Q1 results in proportion to full-year projected tax expense. Changes in the distribution of profit within the year may result in changes in the tax expense recognized each quarter. We project our fiscal 2024 capital expenditures to increase slightly versus fiscal 2023 as we balance the long-term capacity needs of the business with ongoing capital discipline and near-term cash flow objectives. Consistent with our comments the last few quarters, we do see WFE CapEx decreasing from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024. When factoring higher construction spend and expected grants in fiscal 2024, we forecast our CapEx to be more evenly distributed over fiscal 2024. A sequential increase in quarterly CapEx, together with improving but still challenging profitability levels in the near term, means free cash flow will remain significantly negative in the first half of the fiscal year. We forecast improved free cash flow in the back half of the fiscal year. We project our balance sheet to remain strong and net leverage ratio to peak in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. To support the long-term investment priorities of the business, we have ample liquidity and ready access to multiple sources of credit. We will continue to manage our business to maintain financial flexibility and in a manner consistent with our commitment to our investment-grade rating. With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for fiscal Q1 is as follows. We expect revenue to be $4.4 billion, plus or minus $200 million. Gross margin to be in the range of negative 4%, plus or minus 200 basis points. And operating expenses to be approximately $900 million, plus or minus $15 million. We expect tax expense of approximately $80 million. Based on a share count of approximately 1.1 billion shares, we expect EPS to be a loss of $1.07, plus or minus $0.07. In closing, we achieved many successes in fiscal 2023 despite facing a historic downturn. We sustained our technology, product and manufacturing leadership and achieved mature yields in record time on the industry's most advanced nodes in DRAM and NAND. Micron's leading product announcements position us well to address the growing performance requirements of data-centric computing. In response to severe market conditions, we acted quickly and decisively to cut supply and capital spend, to reduce operating costs and improve productivity, and to maintain a solid and flexible balance sheet. As the business improves in fiscal 2024, we will leverage our strengths in technology, product and manufacturing while maintaining the productivity and capital discipline that we displayed in fiscal 2023. I will now turn it back over to Sanjay.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Mark. The past four quarters tested the resilience and agility of our entire industry. While the recovery from this downturn has begun, Micron will exercise continued supply discipline to drive a return to sustained profitability. I am proud of our team's response to adversity, sustaining our technology leadership, improving time to mature yield, and launching a suite of leading-edge products that represent one of the strongest portfolio expansions in Micron's 45-year history. As our global investment announcements throughout the year clearly show, Micron remains keenly focused on building our business to meet future demand driven by the proliferation of AI from the data center to the edge. I have full confidence in our team, the position we have built for Micron, and our collective ability to capitalize on the opportunities ahead. Thank you for joining us today. We will now open up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question for today comes from the line Tom O'Malley from Barclays. Your question, please.
Tom O'Malley: Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I just want to understand the trajectory here on the NAND business. You guys in the quarter kind of took your demand profile from high-single-digits to high teens and you pointed out consumer in particular. What can you do to give us confidence that, that wasn't a pull in from some of your large consumer customers, and that later this year there might be a little hole there, and just talk about the trajectory of where you see that business going, just given you said that bits are going to be down sequentially into November? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So with respect to NAND, yes, I mean compared to what we have said before, we saw strong demand, particularly on the consumer, including some parts of the channel and the consumer part included likes of smartphones, PCs, et cetera, and again, as I pointed out, the channel as well. And keep in mind, with the pricing that has existed for NAND, elasticity has certainly kicked in. The content is continuing to increase in the devices. Today, flagship smartphones have minimum of 8 gigabyte DRAM and 128 gigabyte of NAND. So that's the overall trend and same thing in PCs that the elasticity is driving, increasing average capacities. And overall certainly strategic vibe have influenced some of the NAND demand for the year as well. And keep in mind that next year in 2024, we see that the demand growth will be pretty much close to the long-term CAGR for NAND. And the strat buyers - the strategic buyers that I mentioned, of course, they help improve the inventory position for NAND as well. So overall, of course, supply cuts have been made in NAND as well. And as we look ahead, we do see that the demand and supply fundamentals will continue to improve on the NAND side as well.
Tom O'Malley: Very helpful.
Sanjay Mehrotra: And the inflection in pricing as well has occurred and, you know, particularly in the second half of our fiscal year we would see that continued improvement in the pricing as well.
Tom O'Malley: Helpful. And then just as a follow-up, obviously you're facing headwinds from the CAC band. Can you just talk about areas of the market where you guys are targeting to help make up some of those bits. Is it just conversations with customers in the consumer space or are you looking at content increases in the data center, just given the puts and takes of you know where you're making up that a double-digit percentage hole and if you see kind of any change to that. Is it getting worse or is it getting better into February and May of this year? Thank you very much.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So as we have mentioned before, the CAC headwinds are primarily in the data center and networking markets for us in China. And the impact, the negative impact of revenue as a result of CAC decision is already baked in in our CQ4 results, and is also included in our FQ1 guidance here. And keep in minds that the CAC decision, I mean, continues to remain a risk for our business and the impact in our China demand is meaningful. However, Micron has made strong progress with respect to mitigating the effects as well with our global customers who are not impacted by the CAC decision. And we are mitigating that and effect of the mitigation also is reflected in our FQ4 results, as well as in FQ1 guidance. So the - FQ4 results and FQ1 guidance reflect the net effect of the loss of revenue in China as well as the success with some of the mitigation, and of course, we are working on mitigating the China revenue loss with increases in demand for us across our multiple end-markets, across all our global end-markets. And remember that our goal remains to maintain our global share. While there may be some ebbs and flows in the near term, But you know our goal absolutely remains to maintain our global market share here in terms of bits.
Tom O'Malley: Thank you, Sanjay.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.
Toshiya Hari: Hi guys, thank you for the question. I had a gross margin question for you, Mark. You're guiding November quarter up five percentage points sequentially. I was hoping you could provide a bridge, if you will, on a sequential basis. You talked a little bit about you know period costs continuing to be a headwind. You gave a little bit of color for the benefit you'll see from selling through written-down inventory. But, you know what are your thoughts on pricing. What are your thoughts on cost-downs? And if you can give you know directional guidance for FED and the puts and takes there, that would be helpful as well. Thank you.
Mark Murphy: Sure, Toshi. I am - so on the fourth to first quarter bridge, as you mentioned, we are forecasting roughly a 500 basis-point improvement. We did say over the last few quarters that this would be the profile of our improvement. I will say that it's gotten incrementally better. And that we said before that our profile would be that we would be positive gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24. We now believe will be positive gross margin through fiscal '24 and so you'll see this positive margin trend continuing. As it relates to the first quarter, we do get a small benefit roughly, you know, roughly a point of incremental low-cost inventory pass-through from what passes through in the first quarter, which will be around $600 million versus what we had pass-through in the fourth quarter, which is roughly $550 million. We also will see a slight benefit in price indeed in the first quarter. As we've mentioned in the last several quarters, we first saw pockets of improvement. And then, we mention that prices bottoming. We are mentioning on this call that it has bottomed and we are seeing in the first quarter price improvement and we expect that in this transition period to be somewhat muted in the first half and then pick-up momentum and strengthen considerably in the second half. So that's the, you know, general walk for the first quarter. I will, because there's a lot of puts and takes, maybe just, it's been a very difficult several quarters around both utilization write-downs. And fortunately, we're on the other side of that which we can cover later in this call or the after call.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you. And then maybe as a quick follow-up on HBM for Sanjay. You know, three months ago, you guys talked about or at least hinted that in fiscal '24, you might be able to generate you know several $100 million in revenue. Is that sort of target still intact? Have things improved since then and I guess at what point do you expect your presence in HBM to be similar to your presence in DRAM overall? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: We are very excited with our HBM product. It is an industry-leading product with respect to performance, power, capacity, capability. And as we have mentioned, this product is in the qualification stages with our customers here and we expect revenue to begin in early 2024. And yes, we are very much still on track for meaningful revenue, $700 million in our fiscal year '24. So pleased with the progress, continuing to make good progress. It is an exciting opportunity for the memory industry and Micron will be well-positioned to capture the generative AI opportunities that require the kind of attributes that our HBM3E memory brings to the market. And, of course, as we proceed through the fiscal year, we expect to be gaining share in this important part of the high - in this important high growth part of the memory market.
Toshiya Hari: Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot, Mark, I wanted to clarify the statement on gross margin. So, you had said in the prepared remarks that it would be positive in the back half of the fiscal year. But in response to the question just before, you said that it will be positive through fiscal '24. So since you're guiding negative in fiscal Q1, does that tell us that fiscal Q2 gross margin will be positive?
Mark Murphy: Good question, Tim. I didn't comment on fiscal Q2. I - fiscal Q3, we believe, will be positive. And there'll be a trend of improving gross margin fiscal Q1 through fiscal Q3.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay. So you don't want to state that fiscal Q2 will be positive, maybe it will be, maybe it won't.
Mark Murphy: It - maybe. It depends on of course pricing and we're continuing to drive productivity and we'll just have to see at these profitability levels, mix and other things matter. I mean, we do have favorable mix of DRAM going into the first half. You know, we're increasing DRAM relative to NAND in the first half of the year. So that helps. You know, we, pricing, the momentum is definitively positive. It's just a case of you know we're in a transition period, we did see you know, we kind of had to meet the market on some special deals here in the fourth quarter and you know those effects will continue in the first half, but you know we're definitely seeing new deals being struck at higher prices and we certainly expect that to strengthen in the second-half.
Timothy Arcuri: Got it, thanks. And then as a follow-up, just on that comment you just made about called special deals and - that you, you know, struck in, you know, fiscal Q4. NAND demand, you're more positive on NAND demand, but pricing was still as bad if not worse than at least I thought it would have been in - you know, side of fiscal Q4. So is - can you kind of foot that, is that maybe you offering some big deals on the NAND side, some you know customers coming in and being opportunistic and you offerings some big deals to move bits and maybe shore up your NAND share, but at the expense of price. Can you just walk through that force? Thanks.
Mark Murphy: Yes. I would say, Tim, that, you know, really NAND pricing was not - was basically in line with the downs that we saw in the third quarter. So, I would say that prices - the decrease had slowed and the price or the market was being the firm off. You know that - you know customers realize that this is a period that's ending, the markets firming up, you know, and so, you know, there is also some mix effects in there. We do see price and NAND improving in the first quarter. It will be up actually in the first quarter. And so I think that's all, I'd say, on price for NAND.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks, Mark.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna Financial Group. Your question, please.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes, sir. Thank you for taking my question. Two follow-ups. I would like to better understand the dynamics of seasonality. You talked about the NAND bit shipment declining in the Q1 fiscal year and most of the growth coming from DRAM, but how should we think about seasonality impact in February quarter? And I have a follow-up.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So certainly, the typical seasonality will be in place. But just keep in mind that FQ4, we had a very strong sequential bit growth in the NAND business. And - I mean coming off that big sequential growth, we are just guiding to you know normalized level of overall shipments as part of FQ1 and overall, you know - and again, the content continues to increase across the end-market applications. And that will continue to drive increased demand growth for us as well.
Mehdi Hosseini: But would there be seasonality in February quarter?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Well, typical seasonality trends that exist in the consumer market would be there. But keep in mind that you know it all depends on the mix of the business as well for us. In terms of NAND, you know, in - it - maybe I have already guided to the trends. But overall when we look at the full-year basis, we would look at you know that calendar year '24, NAND will be growing in line with the long-term CAGR or near the long-term CAGR and DRAM will be growing in terms of demand much ahead of the long-term CAGR as well and all of that will of course take into account the typical seasonality that occurs in the industry.
Mehdi Hosseini: Great, thanks for detail. And second question has to do with the puts and takes in reducing wafer starts. And I understand that more emphasis is on the trade mix. But as you - as I think about memory like, there is no trailing edge. And in that context as you think about bringing utilization rate back up to the normal level. and some of the trailing edge converted to the leading edge, could that help with a bigger step-up in gross margin improvement? How should we think about it, assuming that the trailing edge would be phased out?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Well, good question and I think I would like to take the opportunity to provide some context here and overall background. As you know that in 2023, the industry has experienced extreme over supply and you know extreme negative effect on the profitability as well. And you see now that CapEx cuts and underutilization in the fab have been implemented across the industry given the CapEx constraints that we have, as well as given the poor profitability and certainly Micron has done that, but this is happening across the industry as well. And at the same time, the demand for the new products is increasing that requires, you know, as you were pointing out, leading edge technology as well. And in order to maintain our supply discipline and to meet the demand for these new products such as HBM, such as DDR5, we are shifting some of our equipment from older nodes into the newer technologies to ramp up those newer technologies into production. In the past, we would have done this with more CapEx. But we are being extremely mindful of CapEx spend, extremely disciplined about supply. So as a result, when we move the equipment from older nodes to support the ramp-up of leading-edge nodes, it results in a net reduction in overall - in a net reduction and the structural reduction in the wafer capacity as well. And that overall bodes well for the industry demand-supply fundamentals. So keep in mind that as we go through the year, we - and you know, as we shift more of the equipment toward ramp up of leading edge nodes, this will result in overall wafer capacity reduction and lowering underutilization as well. Of course, the legacy nodes will continue to have underutilization through the course of the year. And these are all helpful factors in terms of the demand-supply balance in the industry. And you know, some of the phenomena that we have described regarding structural wafer capacity reduction, this is not unique to Micron. We believe this is happening with other suppliers as well as they grapple with the same supply profitability and CapEx considerations as we are adjusting. So the reduction in wafer capacity is actually the headwind and supply growth. And this you know that increasing wafer capacity has a high bar for auto - for CapEx investments, it has a high bar in terms of ROI, and of course, it would require longer lead-time as well given the new equipment that would be required. So reduction - structural reduction in wafer capacity is overall good coupled where the underutilization in the legacy nodes. And as we pointed out, the new products in the leading-edge nodes also do require more wafer capacity for the same gigabits of production given the nature of like HBM that - where the die-size is twice as big. So, these new products also actually have a favorable impact on the industry supply growth capability. And these trends of supply growth with respect to structural wafer capacity-reduction and the new products that end up requiring more new wafer capacity are extremely important factors in terms of really understanding the improving, strengthening demand-supply fundamentals as we look at our fiscal year '24 and calendar year 2024.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the question and answer session, as well as today's program. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Farhan. Good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered fiscal third quarter revenue within our guidance range, with gross margin and EPS above the range. The ongoing improvement of customer inventories and memory content growth are driving higher industry demand, while production cuts across the industry continue to help reduce excess supply. As a result, pricing trends are improving, and we have increased confidence that the industry has passed the bottom for both quarterly revenue and year-on-year revenue growth. Our technology leadership and strengthening product portfolio position us well across diverse growth markets, including AI and memory-centric computing. Beyond this downturn, we expect to see record TAM in calendar 2025 along with a return to more normalized levels of profitability. The impact of the May 21 decision by the Cyberspace Administration of China on Micron's business remains uncertain and fluid. Several Micron customers, including mobile OEMs, have been contacted by certain critical information infrastructure operators or representatives of the government in China concerning the future use of Micron products. As discussed before, Micron's revenue with companies headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong, including direct sales as well as indirect sales through distributors, accounts for approximately a quarter of Micron's worldwide revenue and remains the principal exposure. We currently estimate that approximately half of that China-headquartered customer revenue, which equates to a low double-digit percentage of Micron's worldwide revenue, is at risk of being impacted. This significant headwind is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery. Micron is working to mitigate this impact over time and expects increased quarter-to-quarter revenue variability. Micron's long-term goal is to retain its worldwide DRAM and NAND share. Turning to technology. Micron continues to lead the industry in both DRAM and NAND technology. We are investing prudently to maintain our technology competitiveness while managing CapEx, node ramps and wafer start reductions to reduce our bit supply and align it with demand. Our industry-leading 1-beta DRAM and 232-layer NAND nodes are achieving world-class yields, and the yield ramp for these nodes has been faster than any of our prior nodes. These leadership nodes provide a strong cost capability, along with best-in-class power and performance specifications that will be leveraged across the portfolio of DRAM and NAND products. In fiscal Q3, we achieved several important product qualifications on these advanced nodes and are well positioned to ramp them in fiscal 2024. We are also making good progress toward the introduction of our EUV-based 1-gamma node in 2025. This node will be manufactured first in our Taiwan site, where we already have EUV capability installed and operating in preparation for this ramp. We also recently announced plans to bring EUV technology to our fab in Hiroshima, Japan, with support from the Japanese government. Micron will be the first company to bring EUV technology to Japan for production. We are also advancing our global assembly and test network in order to support our product portfolio and extend our ability to deliver on global customer demand in the future. In China, we announced an investment of approximately $600 million over the next several years in our operations in Xi'an. This builds on our long history of significant investment in our Xi'an assembly, packaging and test operations. As a part of this investment, we have decided to purchase the assembly equipment of our partner Powertech Semiconductor Xi'an, who has been operating inside our Xi'an facility for the last eight years. We also intend to construct a new building at our Xi'an site to provide space to add more product capabilities. This will allow us, over time, to serve more of the demand from our customers in China from the Xi'an site. In India, with the strong support of the Indian government, we will build a new assembly and test facility in Gujarat to address demand for the latter half of this decade. We are also increasing our investments in assembly and test capacity in Taiwan for high-bandwidth memory products as we gear up for stronger demand in this segment driven by the AI wave. Now turning to our end markets. Customers continued to make progress in reducing their excess inventory in fiscal Q3. Most customer inventories in the PC and smartphone segments are close to normal levels now, consistent with our forecast six months ago. Some of these inventory levels can get distorted by customer attempts to leverage current prices, which are deemed to be transient and unsustainable at these levels, to purchase additional volumes before prices rise significantly. Data center customer inventory is also improving and will likely normalize around the end of this calendar year or somewhat thereafter, depending on the growth in traditional data center spending. In data center, we saw strong sequential revenue growth in both cloud and enterprise in fiscal Q3, driven by some recovery from depressed sales levels in fiscal Q2. The recent acceleration in the adoption of generative AI is driving higher-than-expected industry demand for memory and storage for AI servers, while traditional server demand for mainstream data center applications continues to be lackluster. Micron's product portfolio and roadmap of innovative products position us to capture growth opportunities from AI and data-centric computing architectures for both training and inferencing. Increasingly large AI models with an exponentially growing number of parameters are driving demand for dramatically higher memory content. As we have said before, AI servers have six to eight times the DRAM content of a regular server and three times the NAND content. In fact, some customers are deploying AI compute capability with substantially higher memory content. A striking example is NVIDIA's DGX GH200 supercluster, which shows just how memory-intensive AI workloads can be; it provides developers the ability to support giant models with a massive, shared memory space of 144TB. A significant majority of that memory footprint is enabled by a joint development project between our two companies that extends Micron's low-power DRAM leadership to server class applications. We are proud to pioneer this differentiated LP DRAM innovation to deliver a significant reduction in data center power consumption compared to DDR-based solutions, helping to support our customers' green initiatives. High-bandwidth memory, used in high performance computing, is seeing very strong demand this year, driven by demand for generative AI. We are working closely with our customers and have begun sampling our industry-leading HBM3 product offering. The customer response has been strong, and we believe our HBM3 product delivers significantly higher bandwidth than competing solutions and establishes the new benchmark in performance and power consumption, supported by our 1-beta technology, TSV, and other innovations enabling a differentiated advanced packaging solution. We expect to begin a mass production ramp for this exciting HBM3 product in early calendar 2024 and to achieve meaningful revenues in fiscal 2024. Micron also has a strong position in the industry transition to D5, which is the latest generation of DDR memory. Our D5 percentage of DRAM shipments has more than doubled from fiscal Q2 to Q3, and we expect Micron D5 volume to cross over D4 at the end of first calendar quarter of 2024 versus mid-calendar 2024 for the industry. Micron's 1-alpha D5 modules are qualified and shipping to data center customers. We are also making good progress on our 1-beta-based, high-density 128 gigabyte D5 modules using a 32 gigabit die that optimizes cost and performance to provide customers with a lower cost-of-ownership solution for memory-intensive workloads like AI. We expect these high-density modules to ramp in calendar Q2 of 2024 with significant cost improvements over today's expensive TSV-based solutions in the industry. Our 96 gigabyte D5 high-density module built on 1-alpha technology, using 24 gigabit die, is already shipping in volume and delivers equivalent performance for the majority of workloads versus the more expensive TSV dual-die package-based 128 gigabyte modules. In data center SSDs, Micron's entire portfolio is now on 176-layer or 232-layer NAND, demonstrating our product and technology leadership. We are in a strong position to serve AI demand for fast storage as these data-intensive applications proliferate. In fiscal Q3, we launched the world's first 200-plus layer NAND data center SSD, and qualification is in progress at multiple key customers to support AI cluster installations. In fact, we have already passed qualification of this product at a critical server OEM partner. We also launched our extreme endurance data center SSD, which offers superior scalability and affordability versus hard drives. In PCs, we now forecast calendar 2023 PC unit volume to decline by a low double-digit percentage year-over-year, with PC units expected to be below the pre-COVID levels last seen in 2019. We are excited about the ongoing industry transition to D5 and are well positioned for it with our strong D5 product lineup. Industry client D5 mix is expected to cross over from D4 in early calendar 2024. In fiscal Q3, we achieved record quarterly client SSD bit shipments, driven by share growth in client SSDs as customers adopted our industry-leading solutions. Our SSD QLC bit shipment mix reached a new record for the third consecutive quarter, with growth in both client and consumer. Last month, we launched Crucial T700, the world's fastest Gen5 PCIe consumer SSD, built with our 232-layer NAND. In graphics, industry analysts continue to expect graphics' TAM growth CAGR to outpace the broader market, supported by applications across client and data center. We expect customer inventories to normalize in calendar Q3. We plan to introduce our next-generation G7 product on our industry-leading 1-beta node in the first half of calendar year 2024. In mobile, we now expect calendar 2023 smartphone unit volume to be down by a mid-single digit percentage year-over-year. While units are weaker, we are seeing stronger memory content growth driven by a mix shift toward premium phones and elasticity. We expect sequential growth in fiscal Q4 as customers prepare for upcoming product launches in the back half of calendar 2023. In fiscal Q3, we achieved key mobile customer qualifications on our 1-beta-based LP5X and started high-volume revenue shipments to Tier-1 OEMs. In addition, we achieved significant milestones in UFS with the qualification and ramp of a high-capacity uMCP5 featuring 16 gigabyte of DRAM and 512 gigabyte of NAND. We have also started to sample a new UFS 4 product based on our latest 232-layer NAND technology, which enables industry-leading performance for flagship handsets. Last, I'll cover the auto and industrial end markets, which represent over 20% of our revenue and contribute more stable revenue and profitability. Micron continues to lead in automotive, which is a key market and growth driver for us. In fiscal Q3, auto revenue reached another quarterly record and grew by a high single-digit percentage year-over-year. We continue to expect growth in auto memory demand for the second half of calendar 2023, driven by easing non-memory semiconductor supply, normalizing customer inventory levels, and increasing memory content per vehicle. The industrial market saw early signs of recovery in fiscal Q3. Inventory levels are stabilizing at distribution partners and at the majority of our customers. As a result, we expect an improvement in demand in the second half of calendar 2023. We are excited about our growth prospects in this market, as industrial customers continue to adopt and implement IoT, AI, and machine learning in the factory. Now, turning to industry outlook. Our expectations for calendar 2023 industry bit demand growth have been further reduced to low- to mid-single digits in DRAM and to high-single digits in NAND, which are well below the expected long-term CAGR of mid-teens percentage range in DRAM and low 20%s range in NAND. While the AI-driven demand has been stronger than our expectations three months ago, the PC, smartphone and traditional server demand forecasts are now lower. We continue to expect stronger industry bit shipments for DRAM and NAND in the second half of the calendar year, driven by secular content growth and continued improvement in customer inventory. While the industry demand forecast for calendar 2023 is now lower, the significant supply reductions across the industry have started to stabilize the market. We see both DRAM and NAND year-over-year supply growth to be negative for the industry in calendar 2023 as utilization and CapEx cuts across the industry impact supply growth. While supply demand balance is improving, due to the excess inventory, profitability and cash flow will remain extremely challenged for some time. Market recovery can accelerate if there is further reduction in industry production and these cuts are sustained well into calendar 2024. In response to the industry environment, Micron has taken decisive actions to bring our supply back in balance with demand. We expect Micron's year-on-year bit supply growth to be meaningfully negative for DRAM. We also expect to produce fewer NAND bits in calendar 2023 than in calendar 2022. Our fiscal 2023 CapEx plan of $7 billion is down more than 40% from last year, with WFE down more than 50%. We continue to expect fiscal 2024 WFE to be down year-on-year. Recently, we have further reduced wafer starts to approach 30% in both DRAM and NAND. We currently expect reduced wafer starts will continue well into calendar 2024 as we remain focused on managing down our inventories and controlling our supply. I will now turn it over to Mark.
Mark Murphy: Thanks, Sanjay. Good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal Q3 results were in line to better than expectations, with revenue coming in above the midpoint of our guidance range and gross margin and EPS exceeding the high end of the range. Total fiscal Q3 revenue was approximately $3.8 billion, up 2% sequentially and down 57% year-over-year. Fiscal Q3 revenue included $72 million from an insurance settlement disclosed at the time we provided guidance. Fiscal Q3 DRAM revenue was $2.7 billion, representing 71% of total revenue. DRAM revenue declined 2% sequentially, with bit shipments increasing in the 10% range and prices declining by approximately 10%. Fiscal Q3 NAND revenue was $1 billion, representing 27% of Micron's total revenue. NAND revenue increased 14% sequentially, with bit shipments increasing in the upper 30% range and prices declining in the mid-teens percentage range. Now turning to revenue by business unit. Compute and Networking Business Unit revenue was $1.4 billion, up 1% sequentially. Strong sequential growth in server and graphics revenues was offset by a decline in client. Embedded Business Unit revenue was $912 million, up 5% sequentially. On a sequential basis, automotive and consumer revenues were strong. Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $819 million, down 13% sequentially due to timing of shipments. As Sanjay mentioned, we expect growth in mobile revenues in fiscal Q4. Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $627 million, up 24% sequentially and driven by increased shipments across most of the portfolio. The consolidated gross margin for fiscal Q3 was negative 16%, improving 15 percentage points sequentially. This result was negatively impacted by approximately $400 million or 11 percentage points of write-downs associated with inventory produced in the quarter. Operating expenses in fiscal Q3 were $866 million, down roughly $50 million sequentially. OpEx benefited from ongoing expense-reduction initiatives and gains on sales of certain assets. We had an operating loss of roughly $1.5 billion in fiscal Q3, resulting in an operating margin of negative 39%, improved from negative 56% in the prior quarter. Fiscal Q3 taxes were $102 million, higher than expectations at the time of our guidance, driven by one-time discrete items. As mentioned in previous quarters, despite a consolidated loss on a worldwide basis, we still have taxes payable in certain geographies due to taxable income levels reported in those geographies. The non-GAAP loss per share in fiscal Q3 was $1.43, down from a loss per share of $1.91 in the prior quarter and earnings per share of $2.59 in the prior year. Fiscal Q3 EPS included approximately $0.37 of losses from the impact of the inventory write-down associated with inventory produced in the quarter. Turning to cash flows and capital spending. Our operating cash flows were approximately $24 million. Capital expenditures were $1.4 billion during the quarter. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $7 billion for the fiscal year, thus near $1 billion in fiscal Q4. Free cash flow was negative $1.4 billion in the quarter and improved from the previous two quarters. Our fiscal Q3 ending inventory was $8.2 billion or 168 days. Due to increases in process steps and product complexity, we now target inventory levels of around 120 days, which at present would equate to approximately $6 billion. Our current inventories include strategic stocks of approximately $1 billion over target levels associated with build-ahead of product for cost optimization and risk mitigation. At quarter-end, we held cash and investments of $11.4 billion and had total liquidity of $13.9 billion, including our untapped credit facility. We issued $1.5 billion of long-term debt in the quarter and, with part of those proceeds, paid down $600 million of our term loan facility, resulting in a net increase to debt of $900 million. Our fiscal Q3 ending debt was $13.2 billion. Now turning to our outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter. As mentioned in filings and our comments today, the CAC decision is a headwind to our outlook. We expect the revenue impact to vary by quarter, with the impact in fiscal Q4 being less than the quarterly impact in the first half of fiscal 2024. Over time, we have a goal of retaining our global market share in both DRAM and NAND. In fiscal Q4, as the industry demand continues to improve and despite the effects on our business from the CAC decision, we still see record bit shipments. Fiscal Q4 gross margin will be impacted by costs from underutilization, weak pricing levels and product mix. In the current business environment, the gap between our DRAM and NAND profitability is significant, and changes in the mix can drive large variability in gross margins. Our gross margin guidance does not contemplate additional write-downs of inventory. We continue to aggressively manage our operating expenses and remain on track to exit the fiscal year at less than $850 million. Looking beyond fiscal Q4, we expect OpEx to increase over $50 million in fiscal Q1 2024 on R&D program expense timing and as reductions to employee compensation end. With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for fiscal Q4 is as follows. We expect revenue to be $3.9 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in the range of negative 10.5%, plus or minus 250 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $845 million, plus or minus $15 million. We expect tax expenses of approximately $40 million. Based on a share count of approximately 1.1 billion shares, we expect EPS to be a loss of $1.19, plus or minus $0.07. In closing, we continue to act quickly and tenaciously to navigate this downturn, making the investments to maintain our leading capabilities across technology, products, and manufacturing while preserving our solid balance sheet. In this environment, we remain sharply focused on improving our profitability and free cash flow. As market conditions improve, we will continue to drive efficiencies to hold on productivity gains. Despite the impact of this downturn and effects of the CAC decision, we remain confident in our financial model and our ability to deliver long-term profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns. I will now turn it back over to Sanjay.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Mark. I am proud of the execution of the Micron team and the progress we made this quarter. The leadership products we released and qualified are strengthening Micron's portfolio across multiple key markets. While there are near-term headwinds, I am excited about the new product introductions that we have planned for the next several quarters, which will further enable us to leverage the dramatic growth in AI that is ahead of us. I am confident that this portfolio momentum, combined with our technology capability, manufacturing excellence, financial discipline, and excellent customer relationships, will position us well for the future. I also want to call attention to Micron's 2023 sustainability report, which published yesterday. The report underscores our continued commitment to innovation, the environment, our people and the communities where we operate, outlining our progress and aspirations across our environmental, social and governance programs. I encourage you to review the full report on Micron's website. Thank you for joining us today. We will now open for questions.
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI. Your question please.
C.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, with inventory expected to normalize in the coming months -- quarter, how are you seeing customer purchasing behavior perhaps change given that we're clearly hitting a pricing trough very soon? We'd love to hear kind of how those discussions might be changing.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thanks, C.J., for that question. We, of course, continue to work closely with our customers. And as we said that customer inventories are improving. Except for data centers, inventories are close to normal in most of our other end markets. Data center, we said by end of this year or somewhat thereafter -- shortly thereafter, data center customer inventories we expect to improve as well. And we continue to work closely with our customers. Some of the customers definitely interested in some of the longer-term outlook for the business and other customers operate on month-to-month basis. And overall, of course, we continue to mitigate through some of the impact of the China decision as well. But the value that we are bringing to the customers for our products continues to strengthen and Micron is very much focused on navigating through the current downturn and working closely with our customers to address their future demand. And as we said in my remarks that some of the customers, given the low pricing that exists in the industry today, and before prices begin to increase substantially, some of the customers may be looking at purchasing additional volumes at this time. But in general, the trajectory is of continuing improvement in their inventory levels end-to-end across the supply chain, add the customers directly as well as third parties who may be supplying to the customers. And as you know, inventories at the suppliers are coming down as well.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. If I could just follow-up real quickly on HBM3, you guided to meaningful revs in fiscal '24. Can you give us a sense of what that means? And over time, what size kind of could that look like for you guys looking at kind of three to five years? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Well, with respect to HBM3, we are very excited about this product. Micron has focused on bringing an industry-leading product and HBM3 product that is in early stages of sampling and we expect to begin production volume ramp of this product in early 2024. It is a product that has significantly higher performance, bandwidth and significantly lower power. In fact, as a product, it is close to a generational leap ahead of anything else that is in the market. We have received a strong endorsement for this product in the market and we expect the volume ramp of this product for us to be rapid, to be steep ramp and this will bring in, in our fiscal year 2024, strong revenue growth opportunity for us. So we are very excited about this standout product. It will be a significant growth driver for Micron. And everything that we have done here is of course built on our industry-leading 1-beta technology and applying to it, of course, advanced packaging, differentiated packaging and TSV capabilities. So this is we believe going to be a standout product for us. And we expect -- we target a share with HBM with this kind of industry-leading product that would be higher than our average DRAM share in the industry as well.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question please.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I had two. Mark, the first one is for you. I was wondering if you can sort of lay out what the fiscal Q4 guidance would have looked like net of the ban. I know you said that the impact from the ban gets worse actually in the fiscal first half. So is it as simple as maybe fiscal Q4, you had said low double-digit bit impact, but it sounds like it's probably that big in fiscal Q4. So something less than that in fiscal Q4 and then you sort of expand to a number something in that range in the first half of fiscal 2025 -- '24 rather? Can you sort of handicap that for us and shape it for us?
Mark Murphy: Yes. We had a small impact -- very small in Q3. It's a more material impact in Q4. We do expect the impact to increase. However, our actions to mitigate that will help offset the effect. But really, at this time, it's a headwind, but there's -- and that's clear. However, we are taking mitigating actions and it's very uncertain, continues to evolve on what the impact will be. And again, the impact that we see in the fourth quarter, it's contemplated in our guidance.
Timothy Arcuri: Got it. Maybe I'll ask you in the follow-up. But my second question is for Sanjay. So, Sanjay, I asked you this last call, too. So you alluded to the smartphone customers at least wanting to kind of get out in front of what they see maybe could be some tightness and maybe they're opportunistically trying to take advantage of pricing being so low. Can you just talk more broadly about what might change in your relationship with your customers coming out of this downturn? I mean, could we be headed toward a situation where maybe the data center customers that pushed you and your peers so far during the downturn that maybe we can talk about LTAs at some point. I know that this is a ways away, given kind of where we are today. But can you just talk about maybe over the past three months, when I asked you last time, how the tone of the discussion with the data center customers in particular has changed? Thanks.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Well, our customers, of course, work with us on LTAs. And as we have said, LTAs relate to their forecast for the year, generally. And while some customers may be operating on shorter term or other customers longer term, but generally speaking, they operate on yearly LTAs and LTAs involve supply and demand commitments from the two sides. Of course, sometimes with the changing industry environment on either side, on the supply or on the demand side, there can be adjustments made to those LTAs, and we work closely with our customers in those regards. And we have had close relationships with the customers. We have a very strong product momentum. You are particularly inquiring about data center. And let me tell you that our product momentum in data center with strong portfolio of solutions, particularly addressing the growing interest in AI, in data center, generative AI, becoming a big opportunity, and we look at it for 2024 as a big year for AI and for memory and storage and Micron will be well positioned with this product. And these are all parts of our discussions when we address their requirements on their future purchases when we address LTA requirements. And of course, we need the necessary investments related to our production mix in terms of die requirements, in terms of our assembly and test requirements, and we really work closely with our customers to help manage these. And just keep in mind that -- as I mentioned, that a lot of new product considerations go into the LTAs as well, as well as, of course, the volume and overall demand and supply considerations. So LTAs, at the end, really help both the parties. They help us plan our engineering, our product roadmap, alignment on that, our investments in things such as back-end capacity because products like HBM, product like high-density modules and, of course, in the mobile sector, products like MCPs, et cetera, have all different considerations at the back end. And these are the kind of things, LTAs really help us plan with our customers.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Your question please.
Krish Sankar: Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the good results. Sanjay, the first question I wanted to ask you was you spoke about AI servers having 6 to 8 times more DRAM content and that demand is strong while traditional data center server demand is weak. There's a view that some of these AI servers are replacing over 10 of the DCs -- regular DC servers. So I'm just kind of curious how to think about overall DRAM demand as AI grows but probably cannibalizes some of your regular data center server DRAM content? And then, I have a follow-up.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So look, when we look at the overall DRAM demand, the DRAM TAM, of course, the AI is driving growth. Automotive, certainly driving growth. Other end markets, such as we mentioned, mobile and PC, in terms of -- or consumer, in terms of their end demand, has been somewhat lackluster. The AI demand that is driven in data center, whether it is in the enterprise definitely drives healthy trends for memory growth. Yes, enterprise server and some of the data center demand has been recently somewhat impacted by the macro trends, but the trend of AI and more memory is absolutely continuing. And that's what -- when we look at our overall 2023 demand growth and the projections of CAGR that we have ahead of us, we have taken those into account. This is very, very early innings for AI, and AI is really pervasive. It's everywhere in, of course, cloud applications, enterprise server applications, applications such as generative AI would be in enterprises too. Because due to confidentiality of data, enterprises will be building their own large language models. And as you know, while the enterprise large language models may not be as large as the large language models you may see, and examples such as super clusters, et cetera, but all of them are really tending towards greater number of parameters. Now we are talking about parameters with generative AI getting into even trillion parameter range. Not too long ago, these used to be in 100 millions of range. That requires more memory. So regardless of the applications, whether it is on the enterprise side or on the cloud server side, the memory requirements are continuing to increase. And I'll just point out that 6x to 8x that we have mentioned is the multiple of DRAM requirement in AI server versus standard server. And of course, as we highlighted in the script, there are many compute configurations, such as the supercluster example that we gave you, where the DRAM content that is required is few hundred times higher than a standard server. So really, I think the journey here ahead of us will be very exciting. And when we look at machine-to-machine communication, when we look at opportunities for the virtuous cycle for the ever-increasing data that training applications, that inferencing at scale and various edge applications, including automotive, are driving the requirements for memory and storage will continue to grow well, and Micron is going to be well positioned with our products. And we consider 2024 to be a big banner year for AI, for memory and storage. And Micron will be well positioned to capture this with our strong portfolio of products from D5 to LP5 to HBM to high-density modules, even including graphics.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Very helpful, Sanjay. And then a follow-up for Mark. You said no inventory write-down in the current quarter expected. And if remember right, Mark, you also mentioned in the past that inventory write-down is tight to your view on pricing three quarters out. So is it fair to assume that you're expecting a pricing drop pretty much this quarter? And if the CAC decision does get really worse that 15% to 25% of your sales gets impacted, is there any more risk of inventory write-down, or is that agnostic to the inventory write down? Thank you.
Mark Murphy: Yes. Thanks, Krish. Maybe I'll spend a few minutes just covering because it's a very complicated topic with a lot of moving parts, maybe spend a bit of time on the topic. So our reported gross margin, our outlook, it's a function of many factors, including pricing. The inventory write-downs, which do include or incorporate our forward view of pricing. The effects of utilization, which you heard today, we've increased -- or reduced our wafer starts further. And then just volumes and associated leverage on period costs as discussed in previous quarters, and of course, mix. These factors are continuously changing due to market environment and our actions. And as I've stated before at these lower levels of profitability, our margin forecast and results are more sensitive to slight changes in assumptions such as price. Now given price trends and our current view on pricing and costs, we took a material write-down in the second quarter as we reported $1.4 billion, took another $400 million this quarter. And with these write-downs, we've pulled forward inventory costs, thus lowered the carrying value of on-hand inventories. Yes, as this lower cost inventory clears in the future quarters, we'll realize more income in those quarters than we would have otherwise without the charge. So as an example, we took this $400 million of additional write-downs in third quarter for inventories produced. And considering our latest views on volume mix, we also realized a benefit of near $300 million from selling through the lower cost inventories impacted by the second quarter write-down. So I do want to call out that it's -- with all the uncertainty, complexity and sensitivity at these profitability levels, our write-down and the benefits that we had in the third quarter were not far off what we estimated in our guide. So I think that's a good reflection of our handle of what's happening in the business. Now we've also got underutilization effects, which are creating higher costs in inventories and adding period costs. We project roughly $1.1 billion of underutilization impact in FY '23 associated with the front end. Most of that will impact the P&L this year. Some of it will carry over to next year. But because of the effect of the write-down accounting, less of it will carry over to next year than would have otherwise. Beyond this period of write-down effects, the impact of lower wafer starts between the period cost and the higher cost inventories, the effect is higher single digits on margins, then down to mid and lower single digits on margins as revenues increase. So considering all this, just to give you a sense of profile of margin and in turn pricing, to your question, we said last quarter that we expect -- or as we said last quarter, we expect -- we had a reported second quarter margin to be the trough, and that was driven by the $1.4 billion write-down. With a much lower inventory charge forecasted in the third quarter, which happened, that margin improved about 15 points. And then also, as mentioned last quarter, we said that fourth quarter would be better than third quarter on a lower write-down, hence, we guided today 5 points better than the third quarter. Again, these estimates are sensitive to pricing changes. And -- but in our current view, we expect a gradual improvement on margin to continue sequentially on a reported basis. Now if you take our non-GAAP third quarter gross margin of negative 16%, and we were to strip out the write-down effects in third quarter, both the write-down portion and the realized benefit, and also to normalize, you strip out the insurance settlement which we had in the third quarter, we would still be -- those two things largely offset, so we'd be still at about 16% negative gross margin. So again, over $100 million net inventory effects, the $400 million write-down less than $300 million realized benefit and then the roughly the same over $100 million insurance settlement. So -- and this is a function of the pricing environment, which we, I think, properly captured in our guide. Now that adjusted 16% -- that adjusted margin 16% is down clearly versus the adjusted second quarter margin, which, as I recall, is about 7%, so down 23 points. So under this adjusted view, we would trough on gross margin over the next few quarters, and then we would improve off these low levels through FY '24. So this is a profile that's consistent with what we've discussed before, though the levels are a bit lower and a bit delayed. And so hopefully, that provide you some color both on how we see pricing and how we see gross margin playing out with all the puts and takes.
Krish Sankar: Yes. Thanks a lot, Mark. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your question please.
Harlan Sur: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess as a follow-up to that, Mark, on your gross margin guidance for the fourth quarter, I know there are no inventory write-downs, but is it contemplating a step-up in underutilization charges or period costs associated with underutilization charges sequentially? And because you cut your wafer starts another 5 percentage points right to 30%, if you could maybe quantify that step-up in underutilization charges? And then as a follow-up, is the incremental 5% cut in utilization is primarily a result of the CAC restrictions?
Mark Murphy: It is not. It's more of an industry dynamic and our intent to get supply discipline in the market. Supply needs to come out of the market given inventory levels, and that's the principal driver. As far as the effects of utilization, it is already incorporated in this guide. The period costs in the fourth quarter are about $200 million. And again, they're contemplated in the guidance.
Harlan Sur: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets. Your question please.
Ambrish Srivastava: Hi. Thank you very much. Mark, I wanted to come back to the gross margin. When you had given the guidance for this quarter, you had walked us through in detail. And you had said that stripping out all the adjustments and the industry write-down, 3Q would be at 7.5%. Am I reading this right that now we stripped out as negative 16%, right? So it's much worse than what you were thinking?
Mark Murphy: No, I don't think it's much worse than what we're thinking. If you strip out just the underutilization effects, but you keep in the insurance settlement, you're close to what we said, sort of that 7%, 8%. So that you need to consider. We had said that was in there.
Ambrish Srivastava: Okay. Got it. And then a follow-up either for you or for Sanjay. On the 15% [big round] (ph) number, 15% of bit loss -- share loss in China, how do you recoup that? Is that based on the assumption that bit growth or bit supply will be constrained, and so if the other two suppliers are able to meet the China demand, they'll leave some demand out here -- in other regions for you to basically go after? Is there a pricing element to that? I'm just not pretty sure I understand how [you hit that] (ph).
Sanjay Mehrotra: I will take that. So what we have said is that approximately 50% of our business in China is at risk of getting impacted. And of course, we are focused on mitigating any share loss with CIIOs or as a result of CAC decision, with those customers -- global customers who are not impacted by CAC decision. So keep in mind that our share in DRAM is approximately 23% and our share in NAND is approximately 12%. So obviously, we have opportunities to gain share with other customers. And this is what we are focused on. It will take some time, and the CAC decision can -- I mean, as we have said, it is hurting our business. It is slowing our recovery. It can result in quarter-to-quarter variations as well. But over longer term, our target is to maintain our share. So while near term, CAC decision is challenging, longer term, we will work with customers who are not impacted -- our global customers who are not impacted by CAC decision to increase our share. And we have a long history of working with our customers. We have brought tremendous value of our innovation, our supply, our product portfolio supporting their innovation and roadmaps in the marketplace. Our customers want to see a strong Micron. Our strategy of keeping our target share consistent over longer term with our current share is understood by our customers because, again, they want to see a strong Micron, so they are supportive of this. And we will continue to work with our customers. And of course, as we bring value to our customers with our products and our product portfolio, we will focus on ROI on our investments, and we'll certainly focus on improving the profitability of our business from current levels as well. So we will, of course, keep profitability in mind. And again, it's important that Micron is a strong partner to our customers. And I think customers understand that multiple strong players in the industry is a benefit for multiple reasons to our customer ecosystem.
Ambrish Srivastava: All right. Makes sense. Thank you, Sanjay.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our final question for today comes from the line of Tom O'Malley from Barclays. Your question please.
Tom O'Malley: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Recently, we've been picking up that there is a change in some of the A series where you're starting to see some HBM2E use just given the fact that there's limited capacity of HBM3. I guess part one is, are you seeing an ability to service that market today? And then, the second part of the question is, you're saying that AI servers see about 6x to 8x DRAM content. I assume that contemplates HBM, but you guys are talking about some AI tailwinds today when you're really not servicing that market as much. So could you talk about what you're seeing ex-HBM as the multiplier effect on DRAM today, just so we can get a picture of how you guys are seeing the improvement in data center where they are today ex that product? That would be really helpful.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So certainly, we have had HBM2E product in the marketplace that actually gave us strong experience in bringing up our technology and production capability with HBM. The market, as I mentioned, is -- has shifted -- is shifting to HBM and Micron's HBM3+ product, which I called as a generational leap ahead of anything in the industry is going to position us well as we bring that into volume production during the course of our fiscal year '24, starting early part of calendar '24, contributing to several hundred million dollars of revenue opportunity over time. And with respect to AI part of the market, I want to be very clear that, yes, with respect to high-density modules and with respect to high bandwidth, HBM3 solutions, that part of the market is growing this year, and it's an opportunity that we want to capture, and I believe that we'll be well positioned to capture, as I mentioned, that we will be targeting share in HBM with our absolute industry-leading product that's higher than our DRAM industry average share. So -- but it's important to understand is that AI is being served not only by HBM or high-density DRAM modules, but it is also being served by D5 memory and by LP DRAM as well. And this is where with the D5 and LP DRAM products, we gave you some examples in our script as well. A large amount of LP DRAM being used in industry-leading high-performance compute platforms. In fact, the 144 terabyte that we mentioned in DGX, GH 200, about 122 terabyte of that is LP DRAM. And Micron is very well positioned with a differentiated solution of our LP DRAM there today. So I think it's important to understand that the AI server market is made up of HBM, it's made up of high-density DRAM modules, includes -- it also is made up of DDR5, LP5 and some element of graphics memory as well. So, we do have a broad portfolio. And in 2024 with HBM and high-density DRAM modules getting into production, I really believe we'll be extremely well positioned to capture the growing opportunity in AI. And 75% of DRAM on AI servers today is DDR5. And as I emphasized, and as I'm sure you well know, we participate very well in D5. In fact, we led the industry with our D5 products, again, built on 1-beta technology here.
Tom O'Malley: Thank you, Sanjay. And I appreciate you guys sneaking me in.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session as well as today's program. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-03-28 16:30:00) =====

Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Farhan. Good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered fiscal second quarter revenue within our guidance range, and excluding the impact of inventory write-downs, margins and EPS were also within the guidance range. The semiconductor memory and storage industry is facing its worst downturn in the last 13 years with an exceptionally weak pricing environment that is significantly impacting our financial performance. We have taken substantial supply reduction and austerity measures, including executing a company-wide reduction in force.  We now believe that customer inventories have reduced in several end markets, and we see gradually improving supply-demand balance in the months ahead. Excluding the impact of inventory write-downs, we believe our balance sheet DIO has peaked in fiscal Q2, and we are close to our transition to sequential revenue growth in our quarterly results. We are navigating the near-term difficult environment with our strong technology position, deep manufacturing expertise, strengthening product portfolio, solid balance sheet and incredibly talented team. Beyond this downturn, we anticipate a return to normalized growth and profitability in line with our long-term financial model.  Micron continues to lead the industry in both DRAM and NAND technology. We are investing prudently to maintain our technology competitiveness while managing node ramps to reduce our bit supply and align it with demand. In DRAM, 1-alpha represents most of our DRAM bit production, and we continue to make great progress in initiating our transition to 1-beta. In NAND, 176-layer and 232-layer now represent more than 90% of NAND bit production. We also continue to lead the industry in QLC. QLC accounted for over 20% of our NAND bit production and shipments in fiscal Q2. The Micron team's solid execution and implementation of smart manufacturing has driven superb yield enhancement across our leading-edge nodes. Yields on 1-alpha DRAM and 176-layer NAND have reached levels that are now higher than any node in our history. In addition, both our 1-beta DRAM and 232-layer NAND have reached targeted yields ahead of schedule and faster than any of our prior nodes. We are well positioned to qualify these leading-edge nodes across our product portfolio and will ramp them based on customer demand. We are also making good progress towards the introduction of our EUV-based 1-gamma node in 2025. Similar to our 1-alpha and 1-beta nodes, we expect this node to provide us with competitive performance, power, cost and density improvements.  Now turning to our end markets. As a result of inventory adjustments across our end markets, slowing demand growth and an extremely challenging pricing environment, revenue was down year-over-year in all end markets.  While our industry faces significant near-term challenges, we believe that the memory and storage TAM will grow to a new record in calendar 2025 and will continue to outpace the growth of the semiconductor industry thereafter. Recent developments in AI provides an exciting prelude to the transformational capabilities of large language models, or LLMs, such as ChatGPT, which requires significant amounts of memory and storage to operate. We are only in the very early stages of the void split deployment of these AI technologies and potential exponential growth in their commercial use cases. As more applications of this technology proliferate, we will see training workloads in the data center supplemented with voice spread influence capabilities in the data center as well as in end user devices, all of which will drive significant growth in memory and storage consumption.  In data center, we believe that our revenue bottomed in fiscal Q2, and we expect to see revenue growth in fiscal Q3. Data center customer inventories should reach relatively healthy levels by the end of calendar 2023.  We continue to see AI as a secular driver of demand growth in the data center. An AI server today can have as much as 8x the DRAM content of a regular server and up to 3x the NAND content. We are well positioned to capture the memory and storage opportunities that AI and data-centric computing architectures will provide. Our product roadmap includes exciting HBM3 and CXL innovations, and I look forward to sharing more details about these solutions in the future. In fiscal Q2, we expanded shipments of CXL DRAM samples to OEM customers that service enterprise, cloud and HPC workloads.  Micron is leading the industry with world-class DDR5, or D5 technology. We are shipping D5 in high volume to data center customers and achieved our first customer qualification for our 1-alpha 24-gigabit D5 product.  The latest generation of server processors, AMD's Genoa and Intel's Sapphire Rapids, require D5 DRAM. Servers using these new processes will drive higher D5 industry bit demand in second half of calendar 2023, towards mix crossover with D4 in mid-calendar 2024.  In fiscal Q2, we also began volume production and shipments of the fastest PCIe Gen4x4 NVMe SSD in the market, our 9400 176-layer performance NVMe data center SSD, which excels in AI and high-performance computing workloads. In PCs, we now forecast calendar 2023 PC unit volume to decline by mid-single-digit percentage, returning PC unit volume to pre-COVID levels last seen in 2019. Although still elevated, client customer inventories have improved meaningfully, and we expect increased bit demand in the second half of the fiscal year. With our strong product lineup, we are well positioned for the ongoing industry transition to D5. Client's D5 adoption is expected to gradually increase through calendar 2023, with D4 to D5 mix crossover in early to mid-calendar 2024.  In fiscal Q2, our NAND QLC bit shipment mix reached a new record for the second consecutive quarter, driven by growth in both client and consumer SSDs. We qualified our Micron 2400 SSD, the world's only 176-layer QLC SSD qualified at OEMs, across the client customer base.  In graphics, industry analysts continue to expect graphics TAM growth CAGR to outpace the broader market supported by applications across client and data center. Customers' inventory adjustments are progressing well, and we expect demand in the calendar second half of 2023 to be stronger than the first half. As the performance leader in graphics, we are excited to see our proprietary 16-gigabit G6X featured in the recently launched NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti. In mobile, we now expect calendar 2023 smartphone unit volume to be down slightly year-over-year. While some customer inventories are back to normal levels, other OEMs' inventories remain elevated. In aggregate, we expect mobile customer inventory to improve through the remainder of calendar 2023, and we expect growth in mobile DRAM and NAND bit shipments in the second half of our fiscal year versus the first half.  In fiscal Q2, we continued sampling and qualifying our industry-leading 1-beta 16-gigabit LP5X, receiving very positive feedback on its power, performance and quality from customers. We expect to generate revenue on this 1-beta product later this fiscal year. We showcased our leading products earlier this month at Mobile World Congress, where we displayed 8 flagship mobile customer design wins.  Last, I'll cover the auto and industrial end markets, which now represent over 20% of our revenue and contribute more stable revenue and profitability. Micron is the market share leader in these important and fast-growing markets.  In fiscal Q2, auto revenue grew approximately 5% year-over-year. Our leadership in automotive was evidenced by several milestones in Q2. We reached a new record customer quality score, qualified the industry's first 176-layer e.MMC 5.1 automotive product, and began shipping the industry's first 176-layer UFS 3.1 automotive solution. We expect continued growth in auto memory demand for the second half of calendar 2023, driven by gradually easing nonmemory supply constraints and increasing memory content per vehicle.  The industrial market continued to soften in Q2, as our distribution channel partners reduce their inventory levels and end demand weakened for some customers. Inventories are starting to stabilize at the majority of our customers, and we expect demand to improve in the second half of our fiscal year. In our fiscal second quarter, Micron achieved advanced startup sampling and design-in across automation OEMs, ODMs and integrators with our latest generation of products.  Now turning to our market outlook. Our expectations for calendar 2023 industry bit demand growth have moderated to approximately 5% in DRAM and low-teens percentage range in NAND, which are well below the expected long-term CAGR of mid-teens percentage range in DRAM and low-20s percentage range in NAND. The reduction in calendar 2023 demand from our prior forecast is driven by an assessment of customer inventories as well as some degradation in end market demand. We expect that improving customer inventories will support sequential bit demand growth for DRAM and NAND through the calendar year. China's reopening is also a positive factor for calendar 2023 bit demand.  Public reports indicate that there have been significant CapEx cuts throughout the industry, and utilization rates have declined at all DRAM and NAND suppliers. We now expect that the industry bit supply growth for DRAM and NAND in calendar 2023 will be below demand growth, which will help improve supplier inventories. While the supply-demand balance is expected to gradually improve due to the high levels of inventories, industry profitability and free cash flow are likely to remain extremely challenged in the near term.  Market recovery can accelerate if there is a year-to-year reduction in production or, in other words, negative DRAM and NAND industry bit supply growth in 2023.  In response to the industry environment, Micron has taken a number of decisive actions in fiscal 2023. First, we are further reducing our supply. We have made additional reductions to our fiscal 2023 CapEx plan and now expect to invest approximately $7 billion, down more than 40% from last year, with WFE down more than 50%. In fiscal 2024, we expect WFE to fall further as we ramp 1-beta and 232-layer nodes in a capital-efficient manner. We have further reduced DRAM and NAND wafer starts, which are now down by approximately 25%. As a result, for calendar 2023, we now expect Micron's year-on-year bit supply growth to be meaningfully negative for DRAM. We also expect to produce fewer NAND bits in calendar 2023 than in calendar 2022. Excluding the impact of inventory write-downs, we expect Micron's DIO to decline sequentially going forward from its peak in the second quarter.  Second, we have made further reductions to our operating expenses beyond the executive salary cuts and suspension of Micron's fiscal 2023 bonuses company-wide. We now expect our overall headcount reduction to approach 15%. This will occur through a combination of workforce reductions, which are now largely complete as well as anticipated attrition through the remainder of the year.  Third, Micron continues to execute to a strategy of maintaining flat annual bit share in both DRAM and NAND. While we have had to reduce price to remain competitive in the market, we have not done so in an attempt to gain share. As such, share changes at customers are generally transitory.  Lastly, we have taken additional steps to ensure ample liquidity. Mark will go into further detail. Micron continues to have the strongest balance sheet among the pure-play memory and storage companies, and our strong liquidity will enable us to weather this downturn while ensuring our product and technology competitiveness.  I will now turn it over to Mark.
Mark Murphy: Thanks, Sanjay. Fiscal Q2 results reflected challenging market conditions with continued deterioration in pricing and profitability.  Total fiscal Q2 revenue was approximately $3.7 billion, down 10% sequentially and 53% year-over-year. Fiscal Q2 revenue included $114 million from an insurance settlement disclosed at the time we provided guidance.  Fiscal Q2 DRAM revenue was $2.7 billion, representing 74% of total revenue. DRAM revenue declined 4% sequentially, with bit shipments increasing in the mid-teens percentage range and prices declining by approximately 20%. Fiscal Q2 DRAM bit shipments benefited from the timing of shipments between fiscal Q1 and fiscal Q2.  Fiscal Q2 NAND revenue was $885 million, representing 24% of Micron's total revenue. NAND revenue declined 20% sequentially, with bit shipments increasing in the mid- to high-single-digit percentage range and prices declining in the mid-20s percentage range.  Now turning to revenue by business unit. Compute and Networking Business Unit revenue was $1.4 billion, down 21% sequentially. And on a sequential basis, cloud revenue was down while client revenue was stable.  Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $945 million, up 44% sequentially. Mobile revenue benefited from the timing of some shipments between fiscal Q1 and fiscal Q2.  Embedded Business Unit revenue was $865 million, down 14% sequentially. On a sequential basis, automotive markets were relatively stable following industrial and consumer end markets experienced weakness.  Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $507 million, down 25% sequentially and impacted by challenging conditions in the NAND market.  Consolidated gross margin for fiscal Q2 was negative 31.4%. This result was negatively impacted by approximately $1.4 billion or 38.7 percentage points of inventory write-down recorded in the quarter. These noncash write-downs, which lower the cost basis of inventory, resulted -- results from projected selling prices falling below the cost of inventory and are not the result of obsolescence. Operating expenses in fiscal Q2 were $916 million, down roughly $80 million sequentially. We continue to aggressively manage our operating expenses and expect them to decline sequentially in both fiscal Q3 and fiscal Q4.  We had an operating loss of roughly $2.1 billion in fiscal Q2, resulting in an operating margin of negative 56%, down from negative 2% in the prior quarter and positive 35% in the prior year. The operating loss included the $1.4 billion inventory write-down recorded in the quarter for a 39 percentage point impact to operating margin.  Fiscal Q2 taxes were $53 million. As mentioned in previous quarters, despite a consolidated loss on a worldwide basis, we still have taxes payable in certain geographies due to taxable income levels reported in those geographies.  Non-GAAP loss per share in fiscal Q2 was $1.91, down from a loss per share of $0.04 in the prior quarter and earnings per share of $2.14 in the prior year. Fiscal Q2 EPS included approximately $1.34 of losses from the impact of the inventory write-down.  Turning to cash flows and capital spending. We generated $343 million in cash from operations in fiscal Q2, representing approximately 9% of revenue. Capital expenditures were $2.2 billion during the quarter. We expect fiscal 2023 CapEx to be 2/3 front-half weighted, with a higher mix of construction spend in the second half.  Free cash flow was negative $1.8 billion in the quarter. Our ending fiscal Q2 inventory was $8.1 billion and reflects the impact of the $1.4 billion write-down. Average days of inventory for the quarter was 153 days, and excluding write-downs, 235 days. Inventory levels and days are higher in NAND than DRAM. Our actions on supply reflect our intent to work down days of inventories from these levels.  At quarter end, we held cash and investments of $12.1 billion and had total liquidity of $14.6 billion when considering our untapped credit facility.  Given macroeconomic uncertainty and the market environment, during the quarter, we bolstered our liquidity further through the addition of $1.9 billion of long-term debt. Our fiscal Q2 ending debt was $12.3 billion.  Under a net debt position, our net interest income moves to net interest expense in Q3. Micron's balance sheet is solid with ample liquidity, low net debt and a weighted average maturity on debt of December 2029.  Now turning to our outlook for the fiscal third quarter. Market conditions remain extremely challenging. However, we expect that for the rest of this calendar year, DRAM and NAND bit shipments will continue to increase and supply-demand balance will gradually improve. Included in the fiscal third quarter guide is an insurance recovery, separate and unrelated to that recognized in fiscal Q2 of approximately $110 million, $70 million of which we expect to recognize as revenue. In fiscal Q3, we expect gross margins to be negatively impacted by pricing, write-down of inventory, cost of underutilization and a higher mix of NAND. On write-down of inventory, our guidance assumes a write-down of approximately $500 million associated with inventory produced during fiscal Q3. Small changes to price expectations beyond fiscal Q3 could have a substantial positive or negative impact to the inventory write-down amount in fiscal Q3. Potential variances of inventory write-downs are not factored into the guidance ranges for gross margin and EPS.  As market conditions remain weak, we will continue to aggressively manage our expense profile. As Sanjay mentioned, we increased our headcount reduction target to approach 15% from our previous target of approximately 10%. We now expect OpEx to fall below $850 million in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023. For nonoperating items, we expect net interest expense of approximately $5 million in fiscal Q3.  We now project fiscal 2023 taxes to be less than $140 million. We expect profitability to remain extremely challenged in the near term. We do project profitability to improve sequentially due to lower inventory write-downs and free cash flow to improve slightly, driven by reduced capital spend. But we forecast operating margin and free cash flow to remain significantly negative through the fiscal year.  With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for the fiscal Q3 is as follows. We expect revenue to be $3.7 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in the range of negative 21%, plus or minus 250 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $900 million, plus or minus $15 million. We expect tax expense of approximately $50 million.  Based on a share count of approximately 1.09 billion shares, we expect EPS to be a loss of $1.58, plus or minus $0.07. In closing, we continue to aggressively manage through this period of challenging market conditions, preserving our competitive technology and product positions, strong operational capability and solid balance sheet. Following this downturn, we expect to capitalize on the secular demand trends and growth in memory and storage. We believe we are close to a transition to sequential revenue growth in our quarterly results. We are focused on significantly improving profitability and returning to positive quarterly free cash flow within fiscal 2024. We remain confident in our financial model, and we'll continue to operate the business in a disciplined manner to generate long-term profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Mark. We are carefully managing our business to weather this industry downturn, preserving our technology and product portfolio competitiveness and manufacturing capabilities. Micron is the leader in DRAM and NAND process technology and one of only a handful of leading-edge semiconductor manufacturers in the world. Our team continues to drive new breakthroughs for our customers.  Memory and storage are at the heart of systems and solutions that fuel the global economic engine, drive new efficiencies, create higher productivity and spud advances that make life better for people around the world. We look forward to a normalization of market conditions, and we remain confident in the long-term demand for our solutions based on the value they create across multiple end markets.  Thank you for joining us today. We will now open for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI.
Christopher Muse: I guess I was hoping to get your sense of how you're thinking about the shape of the recovery. Obviously, things don't look great today, but you've been through this before and will get through it. And so would love to hear your thoughts around how you think will come out of this. And given the CapEx cuts we've seen across the industry, it certainly looks like we're going to be an undersupply situation, at least for DRAM in calendar '24. I'm curious what some of your largest customers are saying today, particularly in the data center as they start to consider this likelihood.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thanks, C.J., for the question. So I think we can look at the question from the demand and the supply point of view. And from the demand side, as we have indicated that we are seeing that the customer inventories are improving while still elevated, but in aggregate, customer inventories are improving. And we do expect that the volume of shipments, both for DRAM and NAND, will continue to increase on a sequential basis from here on.  And of course, on the supply side, you have heard actions from industry players and through various reports, you have seen that the CapEx reductions are being made as well as underutilization is being made in the industry. And that is going to be taking out a chunk of – it will take a bite at the supply in the industry. So basically, the supply trend will also begin to improve. So the demand and supply balance will gradually improve through the course of the year.  We have said that inventory -- we believe also days of inventory will continue to improve as well. For us, days of inventory peaked in Q2, and exclusive of inventory adjustments, we would expect days of inventory to continue to improve from here on. We have talked about for our business that we see being close to transition to sequential growth in revenue going forward. So overall the industry environment, with the demand and supply gradually improving, we expect the trajectory of pricing also to be improving. So this then ultimately means that while the profitability remains challenged, and yes, free cash flow remains challenged, but the fundamentals of the industry are beginning to improve.  And certainly, with the actions that have been taken, it could be that in 2024 timeframe that there could be shortages in the industry. But overall, Micron, I think, is taking decisive actions, as we have discussed, with respect to managing our CapEx, managing underutilization in the fab, managing OpEx and really focusing on supply growth as well.  And in terms of some of the market trends and the customer trends that you've talked about, basically, we have shared that PC inventories are meaningfully better and will continue to improve over the next couple of quarters. Smartphones, some customers may have high inventory versus other customers, but inventories continue to improve in the smartphone market over a couple of quarters as well.  Cloud revenue for us, we think, has bottomed in -- at Q2 timeframe. While inventories in cloud remain at elevated levels, inventories in data center remain at elevated levels. We do expect them to improve through the course of the year towards -- and get to normalized levels by the end of the year as well. And in cloud, the new CPUs do drive new D5 deployment, and Micron is well positioned with DDR5 with our strong position with the product. So we think that DDR5 is also tailwinds for the cloud demand with increased memory per server content that it will be driving as well.  So these are all positive trends. And while we are navigating the business through an extremely challenging environment, I hope you see that Micron is responsibly managing its supply and continuing to focus on improving the demand supply environment for us. Of course, as we have said, the recovery in the industry could be accelerated if the demand -- if the supply for DRAM and NAND in terms of year-over-year growth was negative. We, of course, have taken our actions to bring our DRAM and our NAND supply growth for the year to be negative.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS.
Timothy Arcuri: I had a 2-part question. First, Sanjay, I was curious -- just following on the last question, what are the lasting changes that you think that the industry is going to implement coming out of the cycle? I mean it's been so much worse than I think any of us thought it would be. Do you think that the industry and you -- I mean, certainly, you, it sounds like, but do you think the industry is going to be more draconian about adding bit supply? Do you think you can engage customers in more LTAs, given that the writing clearly is on the wall about where pricing is going to go after all this? And then I guess also then for Mark, a question on the write-down for May. Why keep on producing if you're going to immediately write-down $500 million worth of inventory? Is it that you've hit some sort of floor in terms of utilization where you can't go below that? I'm just curious why you'd produce and you'd immediately write that down.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So I think with respect to the industry environment, you have to look at that over the course of last 3 years, the world faced once-in-100-years kind of pandemic, once-in-multiple-decades kind of Russia-Ukraine war and its impact on the economy, 40-year-high inflation and its impact on the macro. And all of these really resulted in an environment that created a material dislocation in terms of the demand, the surge in demand, and then the inventory adjustments that took place and resulted in a material dislocation in the customer behavior as well.  And now you are seeing the process of recovery that is starting, the process of recovery with respect to the supply growth reductions actions that are being implemented. We talked about ours today. And so this will ultimately lead to the industry to recover to healthier levels. The profitability levels in the industry today are simply not sustainable. So the demand and supply environment has to improve in the industry. And keep in mind that before this period of last 2 to 3 years with all these events that I just mentioned, the industry for 10 years plus has been disciplined particularly in DRAM. So I do believe that the investments in the future that require healthy levels of profitability and, of course, supply discipline will be back and the industry will grow.  And particularly, keeping it in mind the strong demand trends. I talked about 2025 being -- we think will be a record revenue year for the industry because last 2 years have been slow demand growth in terms of shipments. We think '24 and '25 will be strong years that will drive strong growth. You are seeing actions on the supply side. The health of the industry will be restored in the future quarters.  And no doubt that AI -- and we talk about generative AI, right? I mean this is very, very early stages of generative AI, and these are the trends that ultimately really drive greater demand for a long time to come for memory and storage. I mean when you look at really the future, it equals AI and AI equals memory, and Micron is well positioned with our technology and product roadmaps to address the growing opportunities there.
Mark Murphy: Yes. Tim, on your second question, we have been actively taking supply out of the market. We took utilization levels down late summer. We increased that more in the fall. And as you heard on the call today, we've taking utilization down even further. And it's -- we're at levels now that none of us have seen before on underutilization at Micron and maybe in the company's history. So it's a significant reduction.  I'll add that we do, as you know, build principally to WIP. So we're able to then finish those products later and minimize the amount of build. We've also very thoughtfully, when we've reduced utilization, done it in the way that we can maximize the cash benefits reductions that we get when we reduce. And then it's important to note that in the time horizon that we're looking at, we are seeing bit volumes increase sequentially from here on out.  Now in the third quarter, I will note just some housekeeping that DRAM volumes were up modestly in the third quarter, and NAND is up sharply -- as strongly, I should say. And while both are price-challenged, NAND is more challenged. But again, we are seeing growth in bits, and we expect that too is the beginning of supply/demand getting into better balance.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely from Citi.
Christopher Danely: Just a couple of specific questions on the expected recovery. Is your base case -- I guess in terms of the PC and cell phone demand for the second half of this year, is your base case expecting those end markets to get back to normal seasonality? And how should we expect utilization rates to trend as you continue to increase DRAM and NAND shipments? Should we expect you to get back to full utilization rates in a couple of quarters? Or is there some sort of revenue or bit level that you could give us that would indicate that you're back to full utilization?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So with respect to the utilization rates, of course, we will continue to monitor the industry demand, and it's important for us to continue to work on bringing our days of inventory down, and utilization could continue into fiscal year '24 as well. We'll make decisions regarding utilization as a function of, again, our latest status in the future around our inventory position and assessment of demand.  Regarding your question on the smartphone market, as we have said that in calendar year '24, we expect that smartphone unit volume will decline on a year-over-year basis, and Q2 growth for us was above seasonal. And as customers' inventory levels normalize over the course of the year, then normal demand trends will also be restored in the smartphone market.  And regarding the smartphone market, even though the unit volume may be down on a year-over-year basis, important thing is that the smartphone market is shifting its mix more towards flagship phones, and flagship phones require more memory as well. So these are some of the trends that will play out as the demand grows over the course of the year for -- in the smartphone market.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: On the underutilization charge, I know last call the team had articulated roughly $460 million of charges recognized primarily in fiscal Q3 and Q4. So how much of this is embedded in your Q3 numbers and Q3 guidance? And given the lower utilization, tick it down to 25% or cut it by 25%. If you continue to drive lower utilization through the second half of this calendar year, like how do we think about some of the utilization charges in fiscal Q4 and second half of this calendar year?
Mark Murphy: Yes. Harlan, so I'll answer it briefly here at the beginning and then maybe take the opportunity to just talk through gross margins and effective utilization gross margin. So based on what we told you last quarter and I went into some length last quarter about the charges and period costs and so forth. But last quarter, we thought we'd have around $900 million in fiscal '23 and about $460 million would hit FY '23 COGS.  With the underutilization that we've stepped up here, we see now about $1.1 billion in '23, and this is a combination of cost and inventory and period costs, and we actually see about $900 million of that flowing into FY '23. And that's driven by not only the increase in utilization costs -- underutilization cost is driven by the effects of the write-down and the accounting -- or inventory write-downs and the pull forward of cost. So if we step back and we look at our reported gross margin and our outlook, their a function of many factors, including pricing, inventory write-downs, which incorporate our forward view of pricing, the effects of utilization, volumes and the associated leverage on period costs, as we discussed last quarter, and of course, mix. These factors are continuously changing due to the market environment and our actions.  And then further, I'll add that at these lower levels of profitability, the margin forecast and the results are more sensitive to slight changes in assumptions, importantly, such as price. So on price, given the recent price trends that we've seen and our current view on pricing, as we reported in Q2, we took a material write-down of inventories of $1.4 billion. And then the Q3 guide contemplates a write-down of $500 million on these additional inventories produced.  With these write-downs, we pulled forward inventory costs and thus, we've lowered the carrying value of on-hand inventories. And as those lower cost inventory clears in future quarters, we'll realize more income in those quarters than we would have without the charge. So as an example, we expect around a $300 million benefit in Q3 from the Q2 charge as a portion of these lower cost inventories sell through. So as per your question, we also now have the underutilization effects creating higher cost inventories and then adding additional period costs. And as mentioned, we see about $1.1 billion of underutilization impact in FY '23, and most of that, as I mentioned, we expect to hit the P&L this year and some of it will carry over to next year. Now because of the effective write-down accounting, less of it will carry over to next year than would have otherwise.  Now considering all this, we expect our reported second quarter gross margin to be the trough, so that 31.4%. And that, again, is driven in large part by the $1.4 billion write-down. With a much lower inventory charge forecasted in the third quarter, you see that we guided about 10 points better relative to Q2. Now again, these estimates are very sensitive to pricing changes, but in our current view, Q4 would be better than Q3 in the sense of a lower charge, if any. And then over time, as bit volumes grow as I talked about in the last call and we talked about today, we get leverage on our period costs and utilization improves.  First, it will improve in the back end, then we'll have better utilization on the front end. And most importantly, as customer inventories continue to improve, inventories come down and supply/demand balance is better, we would expect reported margins to improve through FY '24. But again, a lot of factors at work here. If you were to just strip out the impairment charges or the write-downs in second and third quarters, Q2 would be a 7.3% gross margin, 3Q would be a negative 7.5% margin, so down considerably. And again, this is a function of the pricing environment and the cost of underutilization, including period costs, which, again, I discussed last quarter.  Under this view, we would trough in the second half on gross margin, then would improve off these low levels through FY '24. So the -- in the end, the profile of the outlook is similar to what we discussed last quarter, though, of course, levels are lower with the pricing environment we've seen and the recovery is a bit delayed because of a bit lower volumes. But again, trough in the second half and some improvement expected through FY '24.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari: One question on the NAND business end market. You talked about your bit production being down year-over-year in calendar '23, which I believe is a little bit more draconian than most of your competition. Just curious how you're thinking about the strategy in NAND. Could this cause permanent damage to your relative competitiveness? And kind of related to that, one of your competitors has significant capacity in China. Wondering if you had customers come to you and express concerns around that, and if that could be a potential relative positive for you over the medium to long term.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So with respect to NAND, we are well positioned with our technology and product roadmap. We shared with you today that 176-layer NAND yields are doing exceptionally well. 232-layer NAND, we have begun shipping in the market already. And with 176, as well as 232-layer, we have been well ahead of any competitor in the industry. 90% plus of our supply today in NAND that we are shipping is 176 plus 232-layers. So overall, we are well positioned with our technology. Our underutilization actions, we really believe are -- is what is needed to bring supply in line with demand, and we think these are the actions that are needed to restore the health of the business. And we have said in our prepared remarks that the industry recovery could be accelerated if NAND and DRAM supply growth, production growth, is negative on a year-over-year basis. And we certainly are taking our actions accordingly.  And regarding China, I can't really comment on the part of other customers. But what I can tell you is that our customers really do see a strong technology execution, a strong product execution from Micron, and it's our product portfolio. We have done well with leveraging our NAND and DRAM in mobile markets with multichip packages.  In automotive, I talked about some of the NAND product portfolio expanding and creating opportunities to strengthen our leadership position in automotive markets. And certainly, in the data center market, SSDs is also an opportunity. And our Gen4 NVMe SSDs have been continuing to do well in the client market as well. So our customers see our execution and innovation capabilities in technology and products, and that's what is bringing us stronger relationships with our customers for the NAND business.  And of course, in terms of market opportunities, those continue to be healthy in terms of NAND-displacing HDDs in the data center, and Micron having the right products to grow those opportunities in the future. This has been -- we have been -- with NVMe SSDs and data center, we have been absent in the past, and now we have a healthy product portfolio, and we look forward to growing our opportunities in that space in the future. So NAND overall, in combination with DRAM, enables us to have a strong differentiated value for our customers. And Micron is well positioned with our technology and product roadmap, and certainly, we believe that our supply actions here are prudent.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.
Aaron Rakers: So Mark, I apologize, I just want to go back to the inventory discussion a little bit. Is there any way to bridge the prior comment of the $460 million, again, that Harlan had brought up relative to that? It sounds like $900 million for fiscal '23. I'm just curious on what's embedded in the gross margin for underutilization this quarter. And I guess on inventory, is there any risk of obsolescence of inventory? Or is the inventory good, it just gets sold through at a lower cost of goods at this point?
Mark Murphy: Yes, the inventory is still good. It just gets it -- the cost basis is lower on the inventories. And then as far as your question on underutilization charges. So we do have, as just bridging it from what we said last time, last time we had total underutilization charges of about $900 million that were incurred in FY '23, of which we believe that $460 million would pass through to the P&L in FY '23. And that $460 million was a combination of costs and inventories that clear and then also period costs.  Now our view with the increased underutilization, our view is $1.1 billion of costs in FY '23. And the amount that we believe will pass through in the second half year is $900 million. Again, that is a combination of costs that are in inventory and period costs. Now the reason it's a higher percent of the total FY '23 cost that we saw is because of this write-down accounting where that -- those inventory charges are pulled forward. So I hope that clears up the question.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley.
Joseph Moore: Sorry if I missed this, and I appreciate the detailed puts and takes on gross margin. With regards to the lower cost or market adjustment, can you walk through the mechanics of how you got to this number for the February quarter? I guess a little over $1.4 billion. Is that -- I know you pull the inventory and then you compare that to the market price. How far out in time does that market price assessment take you? And I guess, to the extent that you're -- there's more than one quarter of sell-through that's being adjusted, how are you making the determination of what the price will be there?
Mark Murphy: That's right, Joe. You did a decent job of sort of answering the question. But if you -- I would refer you to our public filings, but as a reminder, we evaluate the recoverability of inventory as a single pool. This method we've applied consistently and as disclosed, we analyzed the recoverability of our inventory based on quantities and values on hand at the end of each quarter.  We project the period over which that inventory will be sold based on our most recent forecast and consider the expected selling prices during that forecast horizon. Since the pre-write-down inventory, days of inventory were about 235 days. That projection covers nearly 3 quarters. The amount by which our inventory carrying cost exceeds expected sales values adjusted for selling expenses determines the charge. And in this case, that yielded a $1.4 billion write-down in the second quarter, and we expect that same process to result in a $500 million charge in the third quarter.
Operator: Our next question and final question for this session comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Cowen.
Hadi Orabi: This is Eddy for Krish from TD Cowen. It seems you adjusted the language regarding your DDR4 and DDR5 crossover date from mid-2024 to mid-to-early 2024, so slightly better than prior outlook. It's a bit surprising given that data center inventory for DDR4 is pretty high. Is that improved outlook driven by better-than-expected demand for new CPUs from Intel and AMD? Or is it a function of you seeing higher share than expected in DDR5? Or is it more of data center customers buying ahead and taking advantage of low price environment? Any color regarding the improved outlook would be helpful.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Regarding the mix of D4 to D5 transition, the comments that I made were for the industry trends, and those have not really changed versus our prior expectations. Of course, there are functions -- they are a function of deployment of the new CPUs, such as AMD Genoa and Intel Sapphire Rapids into the servers, into the data center infrastructure. And those -- and you are seeing that those CPUs are now starting to get broadly deployed and will continue to increase through the course of '23 and '24. So our expectations in terms of transition timing for D4 to D5 for the industry have not changed, and yes, we remain well positioned with our D5 product in the market.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session as well as today's program. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Farhan. Good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered fiscal first quarter revenue and EPS within our guidance range despite the pricing environment, which deteriorated significantly from our prior call. The industry is experiencing the most severe imbalance between supply and demand in both DRAM and NAND in the last 13 years. Micron is exercising supply discipline by making significant cuts to our CapEx and wafer starts while maintaining our competitive position. We are also taking measures to cut costs and OpEx across the Company. Customer inventory, which is impacting near-term demand, is expected to continue improving, and we expect most customers to have reduced inventory to relatively healthy levels by mid-calendar 2023. Consequently, we expect the fiscal second half revenue to improve versus the first half of our fiscal year. We expect our days of inventory to peak in our current fiscal Q2 and gradually improve over the next few quarters as our bit shipments improve and our supply growth is significantly reduced. Despite this improving bit shipment and revenue trajectory, we expect industry profitability to remain challenged through calendar 2023. The combination of our technology leadership, manufacturing expertise, diverse product portfolio, a strong balance sheet and our decisive actions provide a solid footing to navigate this challenging near-term environment. I'll start today with an overview of our technology position. Micron continues to lead the industry in both DRAM and NAND technology. We are first to market with 1-beta DRAM and 232-layer NAND. While both on 1-beta DRAM and 232-layer NAND offer strong cost reductions, we have slowed their ramps to better align our supply with market demand, as we previously indicated. Yield trajectory for these nodes is on track, and we are continuing to qualify these nodes across our product portfolio and will be well positioned to ramp these nodes when industry conditions improve. Our 1-beta DRAM node, which we introduced in fiscal Q1 delivers around a 15% power efficiency improvement and more than 35% bit density improvement versus 1-alpha. 1-beta will be used across our product portfolio, including DDR5, LP5, HBM and graphics. Now turning to our end markets, across nearly all of our end markets, revenues declined sequentially in fiscal Q1 due to weaker demand and steep decline in pricing. Shipment volumes were impacted by our customers' inventory adjustments, the trajectory of their end demand and macroeconomic uncertainty. We believe that aggregate customer inventory while still high, is coming down in absolute volume as end market consumption outpaces shipping. In data center, we expect cloud demand for memory in 2023 to grow well below the historical trend due to the significant impact of inventory reductions at key customers. End demand at cloud customers is not immune to macroeconomic challenges, but should strengthen once the economic environment improves. DDR5 is extremely important for data center customers as the industry begins to transition to this new technology in calendar Q1. As modern servers pack more processing cores into CPUs, the memory bandwidth per CPU core has been decreasing. Micron D5 alleviates this bottleneck by providing higher bandwidth compared to previous generations enabling improved performance and scaling. Feedback from our customers across the x86, and ARM ecosystem suggests that Micron leads the industry with the best D5 products. We expect server D5 bit shipments to become more meaningful in the second half of calendar 2023, with crossover expected in mid-calendar 2024. Building on our existing D5 products, in fiscal Q1, we began qualifying 1-alpha 24-gigabit D5, and we announced availability of D5 memory for the data center that is validated for the new AMD EPYC 9004 series processors. In addition, we are also making progress on CXL, and in fiscal Q1, we introduced our first CXL DRAM samples to data center customers. In data center SSDs, we are continuing to proliferate our 176-layer SSD, and in fiscal Q1, we nearly doubled the number of customers where we are qualified. We have also completed qualification of our 176-layer QLC with an important enterprise customer. In PCs, we now forecast calendar 2022 units to decline in the high-teens percentage and expect 2023 PC unit volume to decline by low to mid-single-digit percentage to near 2019 levels. Client D5 adoption is expected to gradually increase through calendar 2023, with crossover in mid-calendar 2024 and we are well positioned for this transition with leading D5 products. We also continue to lead the industry in QLC, and it is an important competitive advantage for us. In fiscal Q1, client and consumer QLC SSDs had very strong growth which helped increase our NAND QLC mix to a new record. Earlier this month, Micron began shipping the world's most advanced client SSD, featuring 232-layer NAND technology. As the world's first client SSD to ship using NAND over 200 layers, the Micron 2550 NVMe SSD demonstrates superior speed, density and power savings enabled by our industry-leading NAND node. In Graphics, we expect bit growth to outpace the broader market in calendar 2023. Micron continues to drive the industry's fastest graphics memory with 24 gigabit per second, 16-gigabit GDDR6X shipping in high-volume production. In mobile, we now expect calendar 2022 smartphone unit volume to decline 10% year-over-year versus our high single-digit percentage decline projection last earnings call. We forecast calendar year 2023 smartphone unit volume to be flattish to slightly up year-over-year driven by improvements in China following the reopening of its economy. Micron continues to build on a strong product momentum in mobile. As of fiscal Q1, 1-alpha comprised nearly 90% of mobile DRAM base and 176-layer made up nearly all of our mobile NAND bit shipments. We are also well positioned for the LP5 transition and in FQ1, the majority of our mobile DRAM bit shipments were LP5. In fiscal Q1, our LP5X was validated for Qualcomm's latest platform and integrated into Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 reference designs. In addition, we shipped the industry's first 1-beta DRAM qualification samples with our 16-gigabit LP5. Last, I'll cover the auto and industrial end markets. Micron is well positioned as a leader in automotive and industrial markets, which offer strong long-term growth and relatively stable margins. In fiscal Q1, auto revenues grew approximately 30% year-over-year, just slightly below our quarterly record in fiscal Q4 2022. The automotive industry is showing early signs of supply chain improvement and auto unit production continues to increase. The macro environment does create some uncertainty for the auto market but we see robust growth in auto memory demand in fiscal 2023. This is driven by the volume ramp of advanced next-generation in-vehicle infotainment systems as well as the broader adoption of more advanced driver assistance systems. Over the next five years, we expect the bit growth CAGR for DRAM and NAND in autos to be at approximately twice the rate of the overall DRAM and NAND markets. The industrial market saw continued softening in Q1 as our distribution channel partners reduced their inventory levels and end demand weakens for some customers. The fundamentals of industrial IoT, AI, ML, 5G and Industry 4.0, all remain intact, and we expect volumes to improve in the second half of our fiscal year. In our fiscal first quarter, Micron continued to collaborate closely with customers and achieved advanced product sampling and design-in across automation, OEMs, ODMs and integrators with our latest generation of D5, LP5 and 3D NAND solutions. Now turning to our market outlook. We expect calendar 2022 industry bit demand growth in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range for both DRAM and NAND. For calendar 2023, we expect industry demand growth of approximately 10% in DRAM and around 20% in NAND. For both years, demand in DRAM and NAND is well below historical trends and future expectations of growth largely due to reductions in end demand in most markets, high inventories at customers, the impact of the macroeconomic environment and the regional factors in Europe and China. Near term, over the next few months, we expect gradually improving demand trends for memory as customer inventory levels improve further, new CPU platforms are launched and China demand starts to grow as the economy reopens. Longer term, we [Audio Gap] have declined from our expectation earlier this year primarily due to lowered growth expectations from PC and smartphone markets and some moderation in the strong long-term growth in the cloud. Turning to industry supply growth. Industry supply growth in calendar 2022 for DRAM and NAND is closer to their respective long-term demand CAGRs and well above the industry demand growth in calendar 2022. Given the current pricing and resulting industry margins, we expect a significant decline in industry capital investments as well as a reduction in utilization rates for the industry. We expect that DRAM and NAND industry supply growth in calendar year 2023 will be well below their long-term CAGR and also well below expected demand growth in 2023. Due to the significant supply/demand mismatch entering calendar 2023, we expect that profitability will remain challenged throughout 2023. The timing of the recovery in profitability will be driven by the rate and pace at which supply and demand are brought into balance and inventories are normalized across the supply chain. We believe that negative year-on-year calendar 2023 industry DRAM bit supply growth and flattish year-on-year calendar 2023, industry NAND bit supply growth would accelerate this recovery. Micron is taking a number of decisive actions in this environment to align supply with demand and to protect our balance sheet. First, we are reducing our CapEx investments to reduce bit supply growth in 2023 and 2024. Our fiscal 2023 CapEx is being lowered to a range between $7 billion to $7.5 billion from the earlier $8 billion target and the $12 billion level in fiscal year '22. This represents approximately a 40% reduction year-on-year and we expect fiscal 2023 WFE to be down more than 50% year-on-year. We are now significantly reducing our fiscal 2024 CapEx from earlier plans to align with the supply-demand environment. We expect fiscal 2024 WFE to fall from fiscal 2023 levels even as construction spending increases year-on-year. Second, we have reduced near-term bit supply through a sharp reduction in wafer starts. As we have previously announced, we reduced wafer starts for DRAM and NAND by approximately 20%. Through a combination of these actions, we expect our calendar 2023 production bit growth to be negative in DRAM and up only slightly in NAND. Given the manufacturing cycle times, the full impact of the wafer start reductions on supply will be realized starting in our fiscal Q3. Due to our reductions to our fiscal 2024 WFE CapEx, our bit supply levels in 2024 will be materially reduced from the prior trajectory. We continue to target a relatively flat share of industry bit supply. Third, in response to the decline in expected long-term CAGR for DRAM and NAND bit growth, we are slowing the cadence of our process technology node transitions. This change will help us align our long-term bit supply CAGR investments. Given our decision to slow the 1-beta DRAM production ramp, we expect that our 1-gamma introduction will now be in 2025. Similarly, our next NAND node beyond 232-layer will be delayed to align to the new demand outlook and required supply growth. We expect these changes to the technology node cadence to be an industry-wide phenomenon. With our industry-leading technology capability, we expect to remain very well positioned. Fourth, we are taking significant steps to reduce our costs and operating expenses. We project our spending to decrease through the year driven by reductions in external spending, productivity programs across the business, suspension of 2023 bonus company-wide, select product program reductions and lower discretionary spend. Executive salaries are also being cut for the remainder of fiscal 2023, and over the course of calendar 2023, we are reducing our headcount by approximately 10% through a combination of voluntary attrition and personnel reductions. We expect to exit fiscal 2023 with quarterly OpEx of around $850 million with additional savings and cost in our P&L. Although we have taken these aggressive steps, we are prepared to make further changes and remain flexible to exercise all levers to control our supply and manage our cost structure. I will now turn it over to Mark.
Mark Murphy: Thanks, Sanjay. Fiscal Q1 revenue and EPS came within our guidance ranges despite worsening market conditions over the course of the quarter. Total fiscal Q1 revenue was approximately $4.1 billion, down 39% sequentially and down 47% year-over-year. Fiscal Q1 DRAM revenue was $2.8 billion, representing 69% of total revenue. DRAM revenue declined 41% sequentially with bit shipments decreasing in the mid-20% range and prices declining in the low 20% range. Fiscal Q1 NAND revenue was $1.1 billion, representing 27% of Micron's total revenue. NAND revenue declined 35% sequentially with bit shipments declining in the mid-teens percent range and prices declining in the low 20 percentage range. Now turning to revenue by business unit. Compute and networking business unit revenue was $1.7 billion, with weakness across client, data center, graphics and networking. Embedded business unit revenue was $1 billion, with automotive staying stronger than consumer and industrial markets. Storage business unit revenue was $680 million, while QLC mix increased to a new high. Mobile business unit revenue was $655 million, a low level, partly due to the timing of shipments between fiscal Q1 and fiscal Q2. We expect mobile revenue to grow through the rest of the fiscal year. The consolidated gross margin for fiscal Q1 was 22.9%, down approximately 17 percentage points sequentially, primarily due to lower pricing. Operating expenses in fiscal Q1 were down roughly $50 million sequentially to $101 billion. We are taking significant additional actions to reduce our operating expenses through the remainder of this fiscal year. We reported an operating loss of $65 million in fiscal Q1, resulting in an operating margin of negative 2%, down from operating margins of 25% in the prior quarter and 35% in the prior year. Fiscal Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $1.8 billion, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 45%, down 9 percentage points sequentially. Fiscal Q1 taxes were $1 million as a result of profit before tax being close to breakeven. Non-GAAP loss per share in fiscal Q1 was $0.04, down from earnings per share of $1.45 in fiscal Q4 2022 and $2.16 in the year ago quarter. Turning to cash flows and capital spending. We generated $943 million in cash from operations in fiscal Q1, representing approximately 23% of revenue. Capital expenditures were $2.5 billion during the quarter, and we see CapEx trending down from these levels through fiscal '23. Free cash flow was negative $1.5 billion in the quarter. Under a 10b5-1 plan in place during the quarter, we completed share repurchases of $425 million or 8.6 million shares at an average price of $49.57. Our ending fiscal Q1 inventory was $8.4 billion, and average DIO for the quarter was 214 days. The rapid decline in bit shipments in fiscal Q4 and fiscal Q1 has driven inventories well above our target levels, and our actions reflect our intent to work these down. We expect our DIO to peak in our fiscal Q2 and then gradually improve. We ended the quarter with $12.1 billion of total cash and investments and $14.6 billion of total liquidity. Given macroeconomic uncertainty and the market environment, we bolstered our liquidity in the quarter through $3.4 billion of added debt, bringing our total fiscal Q1 ending debt to $10.3 billion. With this additional debt and net of income on our deposits, we project net interest income of approximately $15 million in the fiscal second quarter. We project and intend to maintain ample liquidity while maintaining leverage consistent with our investment-grade rating. Now turning to our outlook for the fiscal second quarter. The near-term market environment remains challenging and negatively impacts our profitability outlook. For both DRAM and NAND, we expect bit shipments to be up in fiscal Q2, but revenue to be down. Included in the fiscal second quarter guide is an insurance recovery of approximately $120 million, most of which will be recognized as revenue. This insurance recovery is related to an operational disruption in 2017 and settlement occurred in fiscal Q2. Beyond fiscal Q2, we expect revenue and free cash flow to improve in our fiscal second half as we anticipate a continued recovery in demand. Related to announced wafer start reductions, we forecast approximately $460 million of headwinds to our cost of goods sold in fiscal '23, most of which we expect to incur in the second half. Excluding these underutilization effects, we expect fiscal 2023 cost per bit reduction to be healthy in DRAM but to be challenged in NAND, primarily due to inflation and energy costs unique to Singapore. As higher cost inventory sell-through, we expect these underutilization impacts to continue into fiscal 2024. In this environment and considering the outlook, we continue to aggressively manage costs. And as Sanjay mentioned, we see OpEx trending down from approximately $1 billion in fiscal Q1 to around $850 million by fiscal Q4. Below the operating line, we will have lower net interest income, as previously mentioned. While there is still a fixed level of tax, as we discussed last quarter, due to the geographic mix and level of income, we now see fiscal 2023 taxes coming in at less than $250 million. We are reducing our planned capital expenditures in fiscal 2023 to be in the range of $7 billion to $7.5 billion with the spending weighted towards the first half of the fiscal year. Fiscal 2023 CapEx includes an increased level of construction for long-term capacity planning. WFE CapEx will be down more than 50% year-over-year. We are also significantly reducing CapEx in fiscal 2024 compared to prior plans. Until market conditions and our cash flows improve, we will focus our capital return on dividends and have suspended our share repurchases for now. With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for fiscal Q2 is as follows. We expect revenue to be $3.8 billion, plus or minus $200 million. Gross margin to be in the range of 8.5%, plus or minus 250 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $945 million, plus or minus $15 million. We expect tax expense of approximately $60 million. Based on a share count of approximately 1.09 billion shares, we expect EPS to be a loss of $0.62, plus or minus $0.10. As we work through this period of challenging market conditions, Micron has the benefit of best-in-class technology, a competitive product portfolio, strong operations, a solid balance sheet and most critically, a tenacious team. Beyond this downturn and over the long term, we are confident that memory and storage revenue growth will outpace the broader semiconductor industry. This is supported by the combination of strong secular trends, memory content growth and better supply-demand balance. Micron is focused on operating and investing in a responsible and disciplined manner to achieve profitable growth and free cash flow generation consistent with our long-term model. I will now turn it back to Sanjay.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Mark. In the last several months, we have seen a dramatic drop in demand. Micron has responded quickly to reduce our CapEx and supply output, and we are taking strong enterprise-wide actions to control our expenses. We have increased liquidity on our balance sheet and adjusted our operational plans. While the environment remains challenging, we currently expect second half fiscal 2023 revenue to improve from the first half. We are confident that the broad advantages enabled by data-centric technologies will create long-term growth for our industry and expect the total available market to reach approximately $300 billion by 2030. Thank you for joining us today. We will now open for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Tim Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.
Tim Arcuri: Sanjay, I had a question about the market outlook for DRAM. You have already said that your DRAM production will be down mid- to high singles year-over-year in calendar '23. And then you said in your remarks, you said that if the industry production was down, this would accelerate the recovery in profitability. But at this point, I guess, I have two questions. One, do you think the industry will be down in terms of production for DRAM? There's some concern about what your big core income competitor is going to do. So I'm just sort of curious, do you think that they are cutting such that the industry production in DRAM will be down just like yours is down year-over-year?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So Tim, I would like to point out that what we said is that our DRAM supply growth would be slightly negative in fiscal year '23. So not mid- to single high single digits -- supply growth for Micron would be negative. That's because we have taken the actions. We are taking the actions in terms of supply -- wafer output reduction reducing supply through underutilization in the fab. And as you know, we have also CapEx reduction. We have pushed out our 1-beta DRAM production in the fab so that we can bring our supply closer to demand. So the industry is oversupplied, and we do believe that actions need to be taken as reflected in Micron's actions with respect to supply reduction. And of course, the rate and pace of the industry supply cuts would affect the recovery of the industry in terms of bringing supply and demand balance closer together. So look, I mean, we cannot specifically comment with respect to the -- our competitors. But what we can tell you is that if the industry supply is -- supply growth in calendar year '23 is negative, and for DRAM and flattish for NAND, it will accelerate the recovery in the industry.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question and that will come from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
C.J. Muse: I guess the question is your -- you've -- in the last few years, really taking the leadership role both in DRAM and NAND. And so as you think about hitting the worst downturn in 13 years and taking the appropriate reductions in supply and cost. How can you, at the same time, make sure that you maintain your leadership? What are you doing on that front? Such that when we do go into the next upturn that you are in that lead position, lead role and can really take advantage of technology again.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, C.J. Of course, Micron is in a strong technology position. We feel very good about our technology capabilities and our road map. Our -- if you look at our 1-alpha DRAM that compared to our prior 1-z node gave us a 40% bit efficiency gain per wafer. And now if you look at our 1-beta, industry, you would expect less, but what you see in our 1-beta node is a 35% improvement in terms of bit efficiency per wafer versus our 1-alpha node. And our 1-beta DRAM node is well designed for D5, DDR5 deployment as well with good performance and good power efficiency improvements over prior products. So it's really 1-beta is a very good node when you compare it to any other even EUV nodes that are out there in the industry. So it's an industry-leading node. We are well positioned with our 1-beta node. And of course, our 1-gamma node will be well positioned as well. And we are timing the production of these nodes to maximize the ROI in our R&D and manufacturing. And of course, to bring supply and demand in balance overall and keeping in mind the longer-term CAGR for DRAM growth and adjusting our technology cadence accordingly. So I think we are managing our technology node development and manufacturing plans our supply plans in a highly responsible fashion, and we'll be well positioned with our technology. And same thing on NAND side, our 232-NAND is in very good shape. Both 1-beta and 232-layer NAND in terms of cost, in terms of quality and in terms of, of course yields, we are well positioned with them and continuing to work with customers in qualifying those products. So not only just 1-beta and 232 layer, we feel good about our technology road map, capabilities and position with our plans for 1-gamma and the node beyond the 232-layer in NAND. And just to point out that Micron, I was recently talking to a leading customer and executive there, and the customer was facing Micron's as being the best in the industry. And same kind of accolades we get from customers on LP5, on GDDR6 on our QLC NAND. And of course, we are broadening our portfolio of products too. So not only with respect to technology, we are well positioned. I think we are well positioned with respect to our product momentum as well.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, that will come from the line of Chris Caso with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Chris Caso: Question is on the pace of gross margins as you go through the year. And you spoke about revenue and free cash flow being better in the second half. Do you believe that's the case for gross margins as well? Do you think gross margins are bottoming here? And if you can comment about some of the impact of the unutilization charges and how they flow through the year and beyond Q2?
Mark Murphy: Chris, this is Mark. I'll take that. A few comments on the profile. We did say that Q1 would be the bottom for bits, and we expect bits to be up in the second quarter and revenue down. So that points to continued challenges around the market conditions. We also expect 2Q to be peak on DIO, but 3Q will be the peak on inventory dollars. So the industry remains in an oversupply situation. But customers are depleting inventories, and we expect them to be in a better position by the second quarter of the calendar year. But profit is going to be challenged through the year, and that will challenge gross margins. Now the utilization effects specifically maybe I'll talk just costs generally first. In FY '22, and historically, Micron has strived and achieved cost downs in line or better than the industry, node advancements, manufacturing, productivity and other factors. But fiscal year '23 is going to be challenging in the near term as these utilization effects and low volumes weigh on the cost per unit and weigh on margins. And there are three principal drivers that will help explain that. One is maybe an overlooked factor is just simply the effects of routine period costs that run through the business on a normal basis, scrap preproduction volumes, pre-qual volumes, freight, royalties, these sort of things. And when you add this sharp decline in volumes and revenue, those period cost effects are going to impact margins. And so we're seeing that. The second driver is the much lower volumes are creating underload issues in the back end. And of course, that creates higher cost inventories that some is period cost, but most of it still hangs up in inventory and creates higher inventory costs. And that also is a significant factor early in the year, especially weighing on our costs. And then third, most visible has been our announcements to lower utilization on the front end. And that is a significant cost -- and we have -- most of those costs are going to be in inventories also versus period cost. And we said that $460 million of -- which is over -- just over half of the total fixed costs that will need to be applied will impact FY '23. Now the rest of those costs will flow through in FY '24. Now if our volumes are better than expected, those higher cost inventories will be pulled through earlier, if volumes are less than expected than more of those costs will flow through in FY '24. But right now, we're seeing about $460 million in FY '23. So in summary, we expect cost per bit to be up modestly in Q1. Again, that's mostly just the period cost effects that are normal and then some back-end effects and that's related to just low volumes. That's going to be a bit more cost in the second quarter. Again, and this is more back-end effects as those inventories clear. And then the third quarter, we're going to have the back-end effects of underutilization and the front-end effects as that inventory starts to clear. But then in the third quarter and then especially in the fourth, we have offsets. In fact, we get -- we resume cost down in the fourth quarter, as volumes have been -- as volumes pick up and absorption occurs. It's not a permanent condition. This is just a function of volumes that are unseen drops in volumes, and you see -- and actually the steps that we're actively taking to reduce supply. And I think it's worth noting that cost is certainly important. It's a great focus. We're managing the details. But the largest impact to the profitability and financial outlook for us is the supply-demand balance -- and the rate and pace of this improvement is going to be a function of aligning supply with demand, and we're taking decisive actions on CapEx and utilization to address it.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, that will come from the line of Tom O'Malley with Barclays. Your line is open.
Tom O'Malley: My question is really on the demand side. I think that you did a good job of calling out what you saw from an end market perspective into next year. But I just wanted to ask specifically on the data center. You've called out inventory in the past, but versus where you guys talked about the data center last quarter, do you think that inventory at customers was worse than you initially thought? Or do you think that you're seeing a weakening in terms of data center and demand?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So inventories with data center customers including cloud is higher than what we thought. So that inventory adjustment has begun, and it has some wood to chop in that area. And of course, the end demand for cloud operations that are driven by consumer-related activities given the overall consumer environment and the macro trends, some portions of cloud and demand may be weaker as a result of that as well. And also in the macro environment that exists today, there is -- given the higher interest rates and other macro trends, companies do become somewhat cautious in terms of managing their overall expenses and any long-term agreements, et cetera. So that can impact some of the current environment for end demand in cloud. But what I would like to point out is that digitization trends ultimately do remain positive. Cloud definitely helps drive that efficiency that businesses seek in an environment like this. We do absolutely expect that once we get past the current macroeconomic environment and macroeconomic weakening, longer-term trends for cloud will remain strong. In terms of the current environment, yes, inventory adjustments and some impact of cloud and demand weakening as well. that's impacting our overall data center outlook.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, that will come from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Krish Sankar: I just have a quick question for Mark. Mark, you said inventory base to peak in the second quarter and inventory dollars in F3Q. What kind of inventory days should we expect in F3Q? And what is the risk of inventory write-down? Kind of wondering what is your inventory write-down methodology?
Mark Murphy: Sure. I think I got the question. So the -- as mentioned, the DIO peak, we expect to be in 2Q, the dollars in 3Q. And from both those peaks, we expect it to gradually improve, which is consistent with profiles that we've said before, though the conditions have worsened and volumes are a bit lower. Yes, we do expect customers to be in better shape by the second quarter of calendar year, and that's encouraging. And then you've seen the steps we've taken on supply to get inventories down. But I did cover this recently at a conference, bears repeating. Inventory is -- it's obviously a risk where we carefully and thoroughly monitor and with the lower utilization we have and the higher costs associated with that per unit. And then the weak market conditions we have, the margin of safety we have has decreased from where it was. We did a thorough quarter-end analysis as we always do. And of course, that includes the outlook. And in that, we determined that there are no write-downs to the lower of cost or net realizable value warranted. We perform extensive reviews of project -- projected pricing. We analyze customer trends, and there are a number of other factors. If our estimates did change, further, there could be risk of write-off in future quarters but none this in the November quarter. I do refer you to our inventory policy that's disclosed in our 10-K. We have a long-standing policy of evaluating inventory as a single pool, and we evaluate this policy regularly, and we apply consistently.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, that will come from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Sanjay, I want to go back to your, the color you provided on the demand trend by end customer or by end application. You've highlighted that the PC unit are expected to be down 5% to 10%. If I just take the current build rate in December and apply a seasonal decline in Q1, it suggests to me that PCs as the end market application would bottom by March, April time frame, let's say, post-Chinese New Year. Could that be a catalyzed -- could that actually catalyze a more improved visibility with pricing for DRAM and NAND? And I asked you because it was the PC end market that rolled over. And I'm just trying to better understand whether PCM market could help stabilize certain part of the DRAM and NAND segments?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Well, of course, the markets where DRAM and NAND are well diversified. PC is one of the markets. And we already talked about the decline in PC units. Actually, in calendar year '22, high teens decline in PC units. This is the sharpest decline in the history of the PCs, and smartphones, another area where unit sales of smartphones globally down 10% as well. And that, too, historically, in terms of a decline is high. So these are, of course, impacting the end consumer demand and then inventory adjustments on top of it impacting the demand. And of course, as I spoke about earlier, that inventory adjustments are happening in other parts of the market as well. I think with respect to our outlook for next year in terms of demand, we expect about 10% demand growth for DRAM in calendar year '23. And when you look at mid-single digits, low- to mid-single-digit demand growth in '22 and approximately 10% in '23 that over a two-year time period is really significantly lower growth rate compared to the years in the past, the CAGRs that have been prevalent over time. So, I think what's important here is that the supply has to be reduced. The biggest factor here really would be the supply reduction. Of course, once inventory adjustments, we are able to get past and the macroeconomic environment improves. The long-term trends for demand, driven by all the factors we have spoken about before, AI, 5G, industrial IoT, autonomous, all of those long-term factors will drive that demand along the lines of the CAGR that we have discussed today. But in the near term, the biggest factor to really address the demand supply is a reduction in supply in the industry. And of course, the rate and pace of the financial performance improvement will very much depend on how fast supply comes into balance. And as we have discussed, we have taken our actions in terms of CapEx reduction, in terms of underutilization, in terms of adjusting the technology node cadence. And we do believe that with the supply actions, the industry environment will improve. I do see that in fiscal year '24, the revenue, the profit and the free cash flow profile would be much better than '23. And of course, again, will be a function of how quickly the supplier just to demand.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, that will come from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Toshiya Hari: I had one quick clarification and then a question, clarification for Mark. You talked about the $460 million of headwind related to the underutilization of your fabs. When you throw out that estimate, what assumptions are you making for utilization rates for the next couple of quarters? You obviously talked about the 20% cut as of today. But are you assuming you stay at that 20% rate for Feb, May and perhaps August? Or are you assuming production rates or utilization rates kind of step up as you progress through the remainder of the fiscal year. And then the question is on the demand side. Sanjay, in your prepared remarks, you talked about customer inventory normalization and new server CPU platforms in China reopening as some of the key drivers for bit growth over the next couple of months or few months. How much visibility do you have into those three dynamics? You talked a little bit about inventory, but we're hearing customer inventory in some cases, might be increasing given some of the deals, not just you specifically, but the industry is striking, the server platforms could be a little bit more skewed to the second half of calendar '23 and China reopening still seems pretty gray. So curious what kind of visibility you have there.
Mark Murphy: Yes, Toshi, I'll just briefly touch on the first one. We're expecting these elevated underutilization levels through most of -- well, through fiscal year '23. And beyond that, we're just going to always be evaluating the market conditions and then we'll update you and the market accordingly.
Sanjay Mehrotra: And on your questions regarding customer inventory, what I would like to point out is that customer inventory in aggregate -- and that means in terms of volume in bits, we believe it has come down, although still at high levels. And you can see that in Q2, we are guiding to increase bit shipments. And just keep in mind that where demand used to be in terms of or the industry shipments used to be a few quarters ago versus now, they have come down substantially. And even though there may be some end market weakening in demand that points to that some of the inventory is being consumed by the customers. Basically, some of the inventory that the customers are holding is being consumed by them to address their end demand. So basically, the ship out by customers is greater than the ship in, in terms of purchases by customers from suppliers. And this trend of inventory improvement, gradual inventory improvement we believe will continue. And by mid calendar '23, we are projecting even though we don't have perfect visibility, but based on all of our discussions with our customers, we are projecting that inventory at customers will be in relatively healthier position by that time. And that's where we say that our second half of fiscal year revenue will be greater than first half, and we would expect continued improvements beyond the second half as well. And regarding the question on China, of course, China reopening has to be monitored closely, and it may be choppy. In terms of the near term, we are assuming that China is reopening for the second half of the calendar year, will result in benefit in terms of increased demand coming from the China markets. And of course, China reopening is not just issue to be monitored in terms of Chinese customer demand, but also any impact on global electronics system supply chains. And of course, we have assembly and test operations in China as well, and we are continuing to monitor those as well with respect to some of the recent COVID cases there. So, I think China, COVID cases and reopening will have to be -- continued to be closely monitored.
Toshiya Hari: And Sanjay, Sapphire Rapids in Genoa, the new server CPU platforms, visibility there in terms of the ramp?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So our products are well positioned, and we expect that these will be ramping during the course of '23 and, of course, continue to ramp in '24 as well. And these are the ones that will drive a greater D5 attach with the servers. And as we said, we expect that for servers, D5 in 30s percentage range in terms of deployment by end of calendar '23 and somewhere around 50% by mid-calendar. So our products are well positioned, and we are looking forward to deployment of those new CPU platforms and that will drive healthier dynamic with respect to D5 deployment. These new processors, they work with more cores. They increase the attach rate for memory because they are bandwidth hungry and that just points to greater adoption of DRAM, particularly D5 memory with those processors.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you so much.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So of course, it has been pushed out. I mean compared to the plans last year or over the last few months, some of those new processor deployments have been pushed out, but we look forward to them getting broadly adopted as the year progresses in '23.
Operator: Thank you. And we do have time for one final question. And that will come from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Aaron Rakers: I'll make just a quick question. I'm just curious, as you guys kind of thought about the guidance for this current quarter and given the pace of change that we saw in the pricing environment through the course of this last quarter. I guess, when you roll up your assumptions for DRAM and NAND, is it as simple to think that you guys are assuming kind of a similar pricing environment our pace of pricing declined this quarter as we saw last quarter? Or are you kind of factoring in any kind of acceleration of price degradation?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So look, we don't comment specifically on pricing, but I can certainly tell you that both DRAM and NAND are experiencing challenging environment. And again, it is about oversupply in the market and decisive actions that we have highlighted today are the kind of actions that are important to make progress towards bringing supply and demand into balance.
Operator: Thank you. Thank you all for participating. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2022-09-29 16:30:00) =====

Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Farhan. Good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered record annual revenue in fiscal 2022 with solid profitability and free cash flow, despite the challenging environment in the latter part of the year. In 2022, we ramped our industry-leading 1-alpha DRAM and 176-layer NAND nodes across our portfolio and returned a record amount of cash to shareholders. We strengthened our product portfolio significantly during the year, as evidenced by record revenue in mobile, auto, industrial and networking end markets. Our share gains in client and data center SSDs contributed to record revenue in SSDs and also in our consolidated NAND business. We also ramped new product categories like high-bandwidth HBM2e memory and GDDR6X. In addition, a record number of customers recognized Micron as the industry leader in product quality. Our fiscal Q4 financial results were impacted by rapidly weakening consumer demand and significant customer inventory adjustments across all end markets. We are responding decisively to this weak environment, by decreasing supply growth through significant cuts to fiscal 2023 CapEx and by reducing utilization in our fabs. We are confident that the memory industry supply-demand balance will be restored, as a result of reduced industry supply growth combined with the long-term demand growth drivers for memory. Micron's technology and manufacturing leadership, deep customer relationships, diverse product portfolio and strong balance sheet put us on a solid footing to navigate this industry down cycle and position the company for strong long-term growth. Our industry-leading 1-alpha DRAM and 176-layer NAND nodes drove strong cost reductions in fiscal 2022. In fiscal Q4, we led the industry again in introducing our 232-layer NAND, becoming the first company to enter volume production on a node with more than 200 layers. We also remain on track to begin the ramp of our 1-beta DRAM node in manufacturing by the end of calendar 2022. Both the 1-beta DRAM node and 232-layer NAND node will provide us with robust cost reduction when they ramp in high volume. Artificial intelligence, cloud computing, electric vehicles and the ubiquitous connectivity offered by 5G are strong long-term demand drivers for memory and storage. As we have discussed previously to support memory demand in the second half of the decade and beyond, we will need to add new DRAM wafer capacity. The recently passed CHIPS and Science Act will help to reduce the memory manufacturing cost disparities that exist between the U.S. and Asia. Following passage of the CHIPS Act, Micron announced our intent to invest $40 billion through the end of the decade in leading-edge memory manufacturing in the U.S., contingent on CHIPS Act support. These investments will ultimately create tens of thousands of American jobs, strengthen U.S. supply chain resiliency and further diversify our global fab footprint. Earlier this month, we announced that we have chosen Boise as one of two leading-edge DRAM manufacturing fab sites that we are planning in the U.S. and we expect to invest approximately $15 billion at the site, through the end of the decade. The co-location of this new manufacturing facility with our existing R&D site at our headquarters in Boise, provides multiple strategic benefits including improving efficiency across both R&D and manufacturing, simplifying technology transfer and reducing time to market for leading-edge products. We will soon announce a second high-volume U.S. DRAM manufacturing site. These new fabs will fulfill our requirements for additional wafer capacity starting in the second half of the decade and beyond. We plan to build these sites in stages. Tool installation and production output will be ramped in line with industry demand growth, which is consistent with our goal to maintain stable bit supply share as well as supply discipline. Now turning to our end markets, Micron's product portfolio has become significantly stronger and contributed to our momentum in the most attractive markets. In fiscal 2022, data center and graphics revenue grew approximately 35% and auto, industrial and networking revenue grew approximately 40%. The combined revenue mix of these important markets grew from approximately 45% of our total revenue in fiscal 2021 to 52% in fiscal 2022, putting us on track to hit our target of 62% by fiscal 2025 as outlined at our Investor Day earlier this year. This portfolio transformation will increase our exposure to the most attractive and stable profit pools in the industry. In fiscal Q4, data center revenue was down both sequentially and year-over-year, driven primarily by declines in ASP. In fiscal 2022, we set a new revenue record for our cloud revenues, which grew more than 30% year-over-year. Cloud end demand remains healthy, driven by secular growth in AI and the digital economy. However, the data center market, including both cloud and enterprise continues to face some supply constraints that are limiting server bills and customers are reducing memory and storage inventory due to macroeconomic uncertainties. With a diverse set of products across DDR4, DDR5, graphics memory, high bandwidth memory and data center SSDs, Micron offers a wide portfolio of solutions targeting this market with industry-leading quality. Building on our recent momentum of market share gains in data center SSDs, in the first half of calendar 2022, we continue to make solid progress in ongoing qualifications of our 176-layer NVMe data center SSDs at hyperscalers and OEMs around the world. Fiscal Q4 client revenue was down both sequentially and year-over-year, as PC unit end-demand declined and customers reduced inventory. We now forecast calendar 2022 PC unit sales to decline by an approximately mid-teens percentage year-over-year. In fiscal Q4, we began ramping 16-gigabit DDR5 in high volume production ahead of anticipated client platform launches. We also commenced volume production of Gen4 QLC NVMe client SSDs and are the only company with a full portfolio of 176-layer TLC and Gen4 QLC NVMe SSDs qualified and shipping to PC OEMs. In fiscal Q4, graphics revenue declined both sequentially and year-over-year. Micron continues to hold an excellent position as the performance leader in the graphics market. In fiscal Q4, we began shipping the industry's fastest graphics memory with 24 gigabits per second GDDR6X shipping in high-volume production. We are excited to see our proprietary GDDR6X memory featured in the recent launch of NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 GPUs. Fiscal Q4 mobile revenue declined both sequentially and year-over-year. Despite the weakness in end unit sales, we achieved two consecutive years of record mobile revenue in fiscal 2021 and 2022. We now project calendar 2022 smartphone unit volume to decline by a high-single digit percentage year-over-year. 5G continues to drive greater content per device and we project 5G penetration to exceed 50% of the smartphone unit TAM in calendar 2022. We continue to execute well on our mobile product roadmap. In fiscal Q4, 1-alpha comprised over 70% of our LPDRAM mobile bit shipments and 176-layer made up approximately 95% of our mobile NAND bit shipments. Micron is exceptionally well positioned as a leader in automotive and industrial markets, which are attractive because of strong long-term growth and relatively stable margins. In fiscal Q4, our automotive business delivered another record revenue quarter and fiscal 2022 auto revenues grew 30% year-over-year, setting a new all-time high. In fiscal Q1, we see some slowdown in our automotive demand as our customers rebalanced DRAM and NAND inventory levels as they deal with non-memory semiconductor shortages and production challenges. However, we see continued strong growth in our second half of fiscal 2023 with volume ramp of advanced next generation, in-vehicle infotainment systems as well as the broader adoption of more advanced driver-assistance systems. We are extremely excited by the long-term prospects for memory and storage in the automotive market and expect long-term CAGR for DRAM and NAND in autos to be at about twice the rate of the overall DRAM and NAND markets. While long-term fundamentals remain strong, our industrial IoT business saw sequential and year-over-year revenue declines in fiscal Q4. Softening macroeconomic conditions have led some customers to reduce overall purchases of DRAM and NAND. Nevertheless, our long-term outlook remains strong for our Industrial business, driven by the proliferation of factory automation and digitization. Turning to the market outlook. The memory and storage industry environment has deteriorated sharply since our last earnings call. Calendar 2022 industry bit demand growth for DRAM is now expected to be in the low-to-mid single digit percentage range, and for NAND, slightly higher than 10%. An unprecedented confluence of events has affected overall demand including COVID-related lockdowns in China, the Ukraine War, the inflationary environment impacting consumer spending and the macroeconomic environment influencing customers' buying behavior in multiple segments. In addition, inventory adjustment at customers across all end markets are also contributing to demand weakness. These factors are depressing demand for DRAM and NAND to well below end market consumption levels. We are also seeing an extremely aggressive pricing environment. Due to the sharp decline in near-term demand, we expect supply growth to be significantly above demand growth in calendar 2022, contributing to very high supply inventories for both DRAM and NAND. Looking ahead in calendar 2023, while macroeconomic uncertainty is high and visibility is low, we currently expect demand growth to be closer to the long-term growth rates of both DRAM and NAND bouncing back from very weak levels in calendar 2022. We expect the inventory at our customers to improve in early calendar 2023 causing demand to rebound starting from the second quarter of calendar 2023. We expect calendar 2023 industry DRAM supply to grow well below demand growth. We are modeling a mid-single digit percentage growth in DRAM industry supply in 2023, which would represent the lowest ever industry supply growth. NAND supply growth in calendar 2023 is also expected to fall below demand growth. Given the elevated supplier inventories entering calendar 2023, we expect industry profitability to remain challenging in 2023. Following a weak first half of fiscal 2023, we expect strong revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2023 as bit demand rebounds following substantial improvement in customer inventories. Projections for long-term demand trends remain strong across multiple end markets. We expect long-term demand bit growth to be in the mid-teens percentage slightly lower than our prior expectation of mid- to high-teens due to a moderation in the expectation of long-term PC unit sales. We continue to expect the NAND market, which benefits from elasticity to grow around 28% over the long term. Turning to our supply. Given the change in market conditions, we have been taking immediate action to reduce our supply growth trajectory and align it to market demand. We made significant reductions to CapEx and now expect fiscal 2023 CapEx to be around $8 billion, down more than 30% year-over-year. CapEx would be lower if it were not for more than doubling our construction CapEx, year-over-year to support the supply growth required to meet the demand for the second half of this decade, as well as investment for EUV lithography systems to support 1-gamma node development. WFE CapEx will decline nearly 50% year-over-year and reflects a much slower ramp of our 1-beta DRAM and 232-layer NAND versus prior expectations. Fiscal 2023 WFE CapEx is focused on developing the technology capability of our leading nodes and new product introductions. To immediately address our inventory situation and reduced supply growth, we are reducing utilization in select areas in both DRAM and NAND. Our CapEx and utilization actions will have an adverse impact on our fiscal 2023 costs, but they are necessary to bring our supply and inventory closer to industry demand. We will aim to grow our DRAM and NAND supply in line with demand over time while continuing to optimize our costs and portfolio to improve our profitability. Before passing it over to Mark, I want to reflect on the tremendous progress that the Micron team has made over the last few years. Today, we are technology leader in both DRAM and NAND with a very competitive cost structure. We have leadership products and a strong portfolio that is transitioning towards high value solutions and we are gaining share in products that represent a more attractive profit pool in our industry. Our balance sheet is strong and allows us to invest appropriately to maintain technology, product and manufacturing leadership going forward. Our world-class quality and manufacturing expertise is recognized by our customers worldwide. We have delivered record revenues in multiple end markets in fiscal 2022, while returning record levels of cash to our shareholders. While the near-term environment is challenging, we are confident in our ability to emerge stronger and deliver financial performance in line with our long-term financial model. The long-term manufacturing investments we are making will further strengthen our diversified fab footprint and position us to capitalize on the exciting long-term opportunities ahead of us. I will now turn it over to Mark.
Mark Murphy: Thanks, Sanjay. Our fiscal Q4 revenues came in consistent with our August 9 update, while EPS was within the original guidance range. Fiscal Q4 capped off a strong fiscal year in which we set a record for total revenue, generated substantial free cash flow and returned $2.9 billion to shareholders. Total fiscal Q4 revenue was $6.6 billion, down 23% sequentially and down 20% year-over-year. Fiscal 2022 total revenue was a record at $30.8 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Fiscal Q4 DRAM revenue was $4.8 billion, representing 72% of total revenue. DRAM revenue declined 23% sequentially and was down 21% year-over-year. Sequentially, bit shipments decreased by roughly 10% while ASPs declined in the low-teens percent range. For the fiscal year, DRAM revenue increased 12% year-over-year to $22.4 billion, representing 73% of total fiscal year revenue. Fiscal Q4 NAND revenue was $1.7 billion, representing 25% of Micron's total revenue. NAND revenue declined 26% sequentially and was down 14% year-over-year. Sequential bit shipments declined in the low 20% -- percentage range and ASPs declined in the mid- to high-single digit percentage range. For the fiscal year, NAND revenue increased 11% year-over-year to a record $7.8 billion, representing 25% of total fiscal year revenue. Turning to our fiscal Q4 revenue trends by business unit, revenue for the Compute and Networking Business Unit was $2.9 billion, down 25% sequentially and down 23% year-over-year. The sequential decline was primarily driven by client, while declines in server and graphics were less pronounced. Networking revenue hit a new record in fiscal 2022. Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was approximately $1.5 billion, down 23% sequentially and down 20% year-over-year. Mobile revenue for fiscal 2022 to set a new record. Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $891 million, down 34% sequentially and down 26% year-over-year. For the fiscal year, NAND revenue in the Storage Business Unit was its highest ever with share gains in both client and data center SSDs. Finally, revenue for the Embedded Business Unit was $1.3 billion, down 9% sequentially and down 4% year-over-year. For fiscal 2022, EBU delivered $5.2 billion of revenue, supported by revenue records in automotive and industrial markets. The consolidated gross margin for fiscal Q4 was 40.3%, down approximately 7 percentage points sequentially. Lower pricing was the primary driver of the decline. For the fiscal year, the consolidated gross margin was 45.9%, up approximately 6 percentage points year-over-year. Operating expenses in fiscal Q4 were just over $1 billion and below the guidance range provided on our last earnings call due in part to lower variable compensation in the quarter. Sequentially, OpEx was up around $60 million due primarily to the timing of technology development spend. For the fiscal year, operating expenses were $3.8 billion, up approximately $500 million year-over-year, driven by R&D to support our product and technology roadmaps. Fiscal Q4 operating income was $1.7 billion, resulting in an operating margin of 25%, down approximately 11 percentage points sequentially and down 12 points from the prior year. Fiscal 2022, operating income was $10.3 billion, resulting in an operating margin of 33.4%, up approximately 6 percentage points from the prior year. Fiscal Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $3.6 billion, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 53.5%, down 390 basis points sequentially. For the fiscal year, adjusted EBITDA was $17.4 billion resulting in an EBITDA margin of 56.7%. Fiscal Q4 taxes were $74 million or over 4% of pre-tax income. Our fiscal 2022 total taxes were $793 million or approximately 8% of pre-tax income. Non-GAAP earnings per share in fiscal Q4 was $1.45, down from $2.59 in fiscal Q3 and $2.42 in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $8.35 for the fiscal year, up from $6.06 in the prior year. Turning to cash flows and capital spending. We generated $3.8 billion in cash from operations in fiscal Q4, representing 57% of revenue. For the fiscal year, we generated $15.2 billion of cash from operations, representing 49% of revenue. Capital expenditures were $3.6 billion during the quarter and $12 billion for the fiscal year. We generated $196 million of free cash flow in fiscal Q4 and $3.2 billion for the fiscal year. Fiscal year 2022 was the sixth consecutive year of positive free cash flow for Micron. During the quarter, we completed share repurchases of $784 million or 13.2 million shares. For the fiscal year, we completed share repurchases of $2.4 billion, representing 35.4 million shares. Including our dividend payments, we returned $2.9 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2022 representing 90% of free cash flow. We remain committed to returning 100% of free cash flow across the cycle through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our ending fiscal Q4 inventory was $6.7 billion and average days of inventory for the quarter was 139 days, reflecting weaker market conditions during the quarter. Our balance sheet is rock solid with strong liquidity, low leverage ratio and a net cash position. We ended fiscal 2022 at $13.6 billion of liquidity, exceeding our mid-30's percentage of revenue target. Fiscal Q4 ending cash and investments were $11.1 billion and total debt was $6.9 billion. Now turning to our outlook for the fiscal first quarter. As a result of the demand challenges described by Sanjay earlier, we expect fiscal Q1 bit shipments and pricing to decline in both DRAM and NAND. We expect that inflationary pressure will continue to be a headwind to costs in Q1 and fiscal 2023. We remain disciplined in our expense management and have taken specific actions with more planned. As we look ahead, macroeconomic uncertainty is high and visibility is low. In fiscal Q2, we currently expect revenue to be in a similar range as fiscal Q1 with bit shipments up, but still weak for both DRAM and NAND. We also expect a recovery in volumes and revenues in the second half of the fiscal year. We expect our inventory to increase in the fiscal first half of 2023 and days of inventory to improve as demand recovers in the second half of the fiscal year. As Sanjay mentioned, we expect our fiscal 2023 capital spending to be around $8 billion, down more than 30% year-over-year, driven by a near 50% decline in wafer fab equipment CapEx. We expect capital spending to be weighted toward the first half of the fiscal year. And as a result, we project to be over $1.5 billion negative free cash flow in the November quarter. We continue to evaluate ways to improve free cash flow, including reducing CapEx, lowering expenses and managing working capital as we respond to market conditions. In fiscal 2023, we expect our tax rate to be elevated. Unless Congress appeals or delays recent changes to R&D deductibility, recent legislation requires that for tax purposes, we capitalize and amortize R&D expense this fiscal year. In addition based on our income mix and U.S. and foreign tax rules, our taxes become more fixed at these lower profitability levels. These factors resulted in an estimated tax of approximately $300 million at a minimum. Beyond this level the actual tax expense will depend on the level of operating income through the year. So in this lower pre-tax profitability fiscal year 2023, we expect to materially higher tax rate. Long term, as our profitability normalizes, we expect our tax rate to be in the low to mid-teens percentage range. With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for the fiscal Q1 is as follows: We expect revenue to be $4.25 billion, plus or minus $250 million. Gross margin to be in the range of 26% plus or minus 200 basis points and operating expenses to be $1 billion, plus or minus $25 million. Based on a share count of approximately $1.12 billion, fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $0.04, plus or minus $0.10. In closing, we had many meaningful accomplishments in fiscal 2022, including delivering record revenue, achieving clear technology leadership in both DRAM and NAND, increasing share and client and data center SSDs, further strengthening our balance sheet and returning a record amount of capital to our shareholders. While the near-term environment is challenging, the Micron of today is extremely well prepared to navigate it with our competitive cost structure, strong product portfolio and rock solid balance sheet. Beyond fiscal 2023, a year starting out with a challenging set of external events, we are confident in our ability to deliver financial performance consistent with our long-term cross cycle financial model, including revenue growth of high-single digits, operating margins of 30% and free cash flow margin of over 10%. I will now turn it back to Sanjay.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Mark. The current macroeconomic environment presents an unprecedented challenge for the industry. Our rapid actions to both moderate utilization and sharply reduced CapEx illustrate our commitment to supply discipline and our focus on bringing our supply and demand back into balance. The Micron team continues to execute with agility to changing business conditions. We remain committed to our strategy of maintaining stable bit share and growing profitability with a portfolio of higher value solutions and we are confident in the long-term technology drivers for memory. New data centric applications and technologies will drive long-term memory demand on the trajectory that outpaces growth in other semiconductor categories. Our strategic investments underscore this confidence and will ensure Micron is able to capitalize on these long-term trends in the decade ahead. Thanks for joining us today. We will now open for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI. Your question please.
C.J. Muse: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, can you provide a little bit more detail on the magnitude of utilization cuts and how we should be taking about any underutilization charges to gross margins in November and February quarters?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So I think I can answer the first part and then Mark can take on the second part on the margins. So with respect to the utilization cuts, they are across NAND and DRAM and approximately in the mid-single-digit range. And of course, these cuts are for the products that have been in high inventory. And so we are cutting production of those products and using the equipment that is freed up and the space that is freed up to deploy it toward the new technology transitions. So that actually helps us with CapEx efficiency. And Mark can comment on the gross margin impact.
Mark Murphy: Yeah. C.J., as you mentioned, it's going to hit us not in the first quarter, but later in the year and it would be between 1 points and 2 points of impact at this point. And of course, depending on market conditions, we would either dial that back or bringing utilization lower.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. And as a quick follow-up, considering your strong net cash position, but your guidance for free cash flow -- free cash flow negative, well, what's your near-term philosophy around buybacks?
Mark Murphy: Well, I think I'll state -- really no change around, we're going to continue to focus on returning 100% of free cash flow to shareholders. We did repurchase in the first quarter and so we will opportunistically repurchase. As you pointed out C.J., we are a cash flow challenged in the first quarter. It's been an unprecedented downturn, sharp and sudden and it has of course associated inventory builds, it's suppressed our income of course and then we've got elevated CapEx as it happened so quickly. So we expect $1.5 billion negative in the first. What we challenge in the second as well as we deal with, with elevated inventory levels and then the revenues that we guided or the bit shipments we talked about. And then the CapEx will take time to work down. We expect it to be weighted in the first half more heavily. We do expect a volume recovery in the back half of the year and lower CapEx and inventories coming down. We do expect to return to free cash flow generation in the second half. And of course, we're working -- continue to work CapEx, continue to work expenses down, working cap -- working our -- managing our working capital best we can to improve from this first quarter projection we have.
C.J. Muse: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question please.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Mark, so it sounds like you're basically calling sort of February as the bottom in the earnings. It sounds like revenue is going to be about flat, but obviously, gross margin is probably going to move lower because you said pricing is going to come down and it sounds like costs are going to go up. But I guess my question is more sort of around the behavior from these cloud customers in light of what's happening to supply. I mean DRAM supply is -- as you said, up only mid-singles, next year most of that has to be coming out of inventory, so production is probably pretty flat across the industry, if not down. So these are pretty sophisticated customers, so I would think that they're going to come back to the table pretty early next year, such that you can see a pretty sharp recovery in pricing. So I'm just sort of wondering if maybe Sanjay or Mark, you can talk about sort of the behavior from these cloud customers and sort of how you think this plays out through the year as you've sort of called February as the bottom? Thanks.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So look we are not going to project future pricing trends here, but of course, we will continue to work closely with customers, not just in cloud, but customers across all end market segments. And of course, as we noted that inventories are at our customers are high, across all end market segments and they are adjusting their inventory levels including in cloud. We will of course, most important thing is to take actions and we have taken decisive action with respect to WFE reduction by nearly 50% and reducing our supply growth. We expect the industry supply growth to be in the mid-single digit in 2023 and our supply growth will also be in line with the industry around the same for DRAM. So I think what's important is that the supply growth will be less, while the demand growth once inventory adjustments at customers have normalized or have substantially improved by our second fiscal second half, then demand will go up from customers and we expect that the DRAM demand will be in mid-teens supported by inventory, but the supply growth will be meaningfully less than demand growth and that's what will brings an improving trajectory [Technical Difficulty] of industry supply-demand balance in improving fundamentals for our business as we go through calendar year '23.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks. Can I just clarify on that, Sanjay? So, your supply will be mid-single digits, but your production is actually going to be down year-over-year, correct?
Sanjay Mehrotra: What we are saying is that the supply growth will be mid-single digits and -- but the shipments will be in the mid-teens range in line with the demand recovery that we expect. And we are also saying that we expect industries supply growth to be also in the mid-single digit for DRAM next year. Remember, this is -- this would correspond to the lowest on record supply growth for DRAM.
Timothy Arcuri: Perfect. Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So again, the supply growth will be in the mid-single digit, inventory will be used to supply the demand, which will be higher than the supply growth. We expect the demand to be in mid-teens next year.
Timothy Arcuri: Thank you, Sanjay.
Mark Murphy: Yeah. Maybe -- maybe Tim just to maybe provide some color around the quarters. We do expect as we've laid out the bits in ASP will be down in the first quarter and they're down about the same volume, maybe down a little bit more. Costs are slightly up and DRAM and NAND and that's just a combination of volume mix inflation and then just node timing. In the second quarter, as Sanjay mentioned bits will be up, but they'll still be down year-over-year, and then as we said, the revenue range will be similar to the first quarter. And then in the second half, bits will be up sequentially, third to fourth quarter and then second half should be up in bits year-over-year. And then cost for the full year, we would expect DRAM cost downs to be lower than the long-term average. We do get some benefit from FX, but we get some inflation and some other factors that go against us. And then NAND, cost reductions are challenged, combination of mix and inflation and just a more difficult situation there. But I think the important takeaway, first quarter we expect things to improve versus volumes and then the market better in the second half.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman from BNP Paribas. Your question please.
Karl Ackerman: Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. I have two questions please. I guess the first question is just kind of a follow-up on CapEx. I know in the past you have described capital intensity being in the 30% to 35% range of sales. But it does appear that memory demand for calendar '22 and calendar '23 could still be below your long-term expectations of mid-teens DRAM demand and 20% to 30 % for NAND demand. And so I guess the question is, do you believe that the industries framework for CapEx needs to consider a lower terminal bit growth rate for DRAM and NAND. And I guess, what are your own views on managing long-term capital investment to support bit demand beyond fiscal '23? And I have a follow up please.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So our view on long-term DRAM CAGR is mid-teens and NAND CAGR approximately 28%. And we would always be managing our investments to grow our supply in line with demand. Of course, there can be variations through the cycle, but we will overall focus on making adjustments as needed, just like you have seen adjustments now. And just keep in mind that as we look ahead at CapEx considerations, we should keep in mind that the tech transitions are getting more expensive. And of course, tech transitions are taking longer as well. So the capital intensity is higher. Tech transitions and also giving actually lower bit growth, and of course, transition to DDR5 is also contributing to lower bit growth per wafer because of DDR5 die tends to be just bigger than DDR4 die because of the specifications. So our expectation is, cross-cycle on average over long term, our CapEx would be around mid-30s that we had stated earlier, mid 30% of revenue. And of course, any given year there can be variations, but that's across cycle CapEx intensity that we would be expecting.
Karl Ackerman: I appreciate that, Sanjay. Thank you. I guess for my follow-up, I was curious, what portion of your unfinished goods inventory is fungible and can be repurposed to either different end markets or different customers, even within that same end markets? Is there any clarity in terms of how you can kind of repurpose on the inventory that you have would be quite helpful? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Yeah. I think, Karl, most of it, it's designed to the way we build it, designed to be repurposed. I mean there are some limitations, of course, but -- and that, that strategy is going to -- going to yield benefit here because, this downturn was so sharp and sudden, unprecedented that inventories have grown to levels over what we thought just last quarter when we had our earnings call. We ended at 139 days. We should be down around 100, 110 ideally, but we do expect an increase again in the first quarter to be over 150 days and it will be elevated through the second quarter and stay elevated, probably through the balance of the year until the recovery is meaningful and customers replenish their own inventories. But we should see it begin to decline in days over the back half. And of course, this view shape the CapEx as well to take supply out. And -- but we're confident that over time, it's good inventory. I think it's leading node primarily and as you point out, it's fungible in a sense, so we're confident that over time, we'll be able to redeploy or use that inventory and eventually get down to our target 100, 110 days.
Karl Ackerman: Very clear. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.
Joseph Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the November quarter. At the midpoint, it looks like your cost of sales comes down almost $900 million sequentially and I think of that is being kind of depreciation labor overheads things like that. What's happening there that the sort of fixed cost elements of that are coming down so much and is that sustainable beyond the November quarter?
Mark Murphy: Joe, we're -- I mean we're clearly, we're running the fabs and that's being absorbed into inventories. So I think that's the short answer to your question.
Joseph Moore: Okay.
Sanjay Mehrotra: And volumes down are down of course, so...
Joseph Moore: Yeah. Okay. So you built $1 billion worth of inventory in August quarter, almost that much and you had $4 billion cost of sales, and it's going down $3.1 billion next quarter. So I guess it is a pretty significant inventory build is what we would readout?
Mark Murphy: Yeah. I think as I answered in the last question, we're -- our inventory levels are high and they're going to be higher. There'll be over 150 days we believe. And again, it's a function of this unprecedented period and we're doing what we can do, affect future supply, our future capacity being in a position to work those inventories down, they're high quality inventories. So, though -- they will be usable and we're managing working capital expenses, cash flow all of them aggressively at this time.
Joseph Moore: Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Your question please.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes, sir. Thanks for taking my question. Mark, just a quick follow-up. You commented that February revenue could track flattish, but gross margin would at least be down 2 points, because you said the under-utilization charges would have a gross margin impact later, is that -- should I assume that that will happen in February?
Mark Murphy: Yeah. It would be -- it depends on when the inventory is clear, but yes, later in the year, Mehdi. And then you've got, gross margin of course is going to be a function, it's not just that cost element, it's going to be pricing and -- at that point in the market. We think volumes are recovering and we're just -- we're not guiding out at that point on the rest of the P&L or the elements of the P&L.
Mehdi Hosseini: Should I spread 200 basis point of gross margin hit due to under-utilization throughout the remainder of fiscal '23?
Mark Murphy: Yeah, Mehdi. We're not -- I mean that's going to be a headwind in the back half of the year.
Mehdi Hosseini: Got it.
Mark Murphy: But its -- but we're not guiding those quarters at this point. Just we gave a framework for how we see our business recovering along with the broader industry and what we believe will be the demand activity with our customers.
Mehdi Hosseini: Sure. Fair. And I guess my follow-up question is also related to under-utilization rates. You've laid out a very conservative view on bit shipment for '23, especially, on the supply side, but you're also assuming demand would inflect to be after February quarter. Would there be a scenario that given actually the demand improvement is not as significant and would you be willing to take additional under-utilization like charges?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So Mehdi, I would say that we would of course continue to monitor the macro trends as well as the trends in our industry and the overall business. And of course, we will be prepared to take necessary actions as appropriate to address the short term as well as the long-term needs. So we will continue to look at, just like we have moved decisively here with respect to under-utilization, looking at products that have excess inventory and leveraging that utilization -- under-utilization as I said before toward -- using the tools towards, deferring CapEx requirements and we'll continue to look for those opportunities as needed.
Mehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your question please.
Vivek Arya: Hello. Thanks for taking my question. I think Sanjay in your prepared remarks, you mentioned calendar '23 bit demand will be in line with historical trends. I'm curious, what are your assumptions about the PC and the smartphone market next year that would support bit demand growth to be in line with historical trends?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So with respect to PC, this year, PC -- overall PC unit demand is down, as I mentioned in the script mid-teens percentage points. And next year in calendar year '23, we expect it to be flat to slightly down. And with respect to smartphones, we certainly expect that China would be opening up and China economy would be rebounding. The COVID lockdowns have had significant impact on China demand. So overall smartphone unit sales this year, down -- on a year-over-year basis down high-single digits, and we would expect that next year there would be some rebound in the smartphone unit sales. Again, I think what's important is that the content continues to be the biggest driver of growth, 5G phones need more, memory need more storage. And as we also highlighted in our prepared remarks, of course, we are extremely focused on shifting the business away from what used to be of 55% in consumer side, including PC and smartphone in fiscal year '21 towards going to 38% by fiscal year '25. So we are really marching along well on that strategy. In fact, in fiscal year '22, we reduced that percentage to 48%. So we are increasing the mix of more attractive and more stable markets such as, of course, data center and automotive, industrial, networking, graphics and we are successfully delivering on that strategy.
Vivek Arya: Got it. Very helpful. And then on the range of WFE cuts for next year, are you expecting your competitors to also reduce spending by the same level? And where I'm going with that question is that at what point does it become a competitive concern, because historically most of your spending has been on technology. So if you're cutting that by 50%, at what point does that impact your competitive capabilities and impact your cost down capabilities?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So look, historically, the DRAM industry in recent years has been disciplined in terms of CapEx management and supply growth management. Of course, the current environment is unprecedented with respect to the confluence of factors that we discussed, that have impacted demand, and the unprecedented level of inventory adjustments by our customers as well. We will take the necessary actions to bring our supply in line with demand. We think it is prudent. It is important to be rational in this regard. Of course, as we highlighted that this is a headwind to costs, with respect to delaying the technology transitions for our 1-beta and for our 232-layer NAND, as well as using under-utilization. But this is the right thing to do for the business to bring supply growth in line with demand growth and this is what will restore the healthy trajectory of demand-supply balance. So this is the right thing to do and I just want to also highlight that we would, of course, maintain our share as well and that is important, but as part of that strategy, we will also continue to shift towards part of the market, as I highlighted in my prior comments, where the profit pool is greater. So we will maintain share, but we will also continue to shift towards strengthened profitability. And I think you've seen that from Micron over the course of last few years, whereas we used to be significantly behind our competitors in margins. Today, we are matching the margins, if you look at past few quarters. So I think that just shows that we remain disciplined and we remain focused on continuing to shift our portfolio towards greater pools of our profitability.
Mark Murphy: And then maybe just to add, Vivek is, I think we made the point that of the remaining spend we have, its focus is on technology. So to your point, we appreciate the need to invest in advancing the technology into business, so the remaining spend we have will be focused on that. And then, we still can maintain our position in the market with the inventories that we have -- that we talked about in the prior question, well over 150 days as we enter the next or the next quarter and we'll have that drawn for some period of time.
Vivek Arya: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin from Stifel. Your question please.
Brian Chin: Great. Good afternoon, and thanks for sneaking us in to ask a question. It is related to the last question, but -- what that is your assumption for industry memory WFE decline in 2023 -- calendar '23, that translates into a mid-single digit increase in DRAM bit supply next year?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Look, we have shared with you what we are implementing in terms of our WFE, but we certainly can't be commenting on parts of others in the industry with respect to their WFE actions. But as I pointed out, historically, the industry has been disciplined, has been prudent in terms of taking actions to manage supply growth, especially when it gets ahead of the industry demand.
Brian Chin: Okay. Yeah. I was just curious what that is, even not knowing what company plans are, but that assumption is because there must be a particular assumption that drives sort or that mid-single-digit supply growth for DRAM bits. Maybe closer to how maybe just one follow -- quick follow-up, if start kick -- you kick start 1-beta DRAM and 232-layer NAND in the second half of this year. Just curious how long -- how many quarters do you think until that, those two products crossover 50% of bit shipments and if it's a bit slower than originally planned, how does that compare to a typical timeframe to ramp the new technologies?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So I think it's important to understand that we are delaying the ramp off 232-layer and 1-beta technologies versus our prior plans. And most of the CapEx -- the $8 billion CapEx that we have talked about or the WFE CapEx that we are talking about is actually going toward preparing those technologies for engineering learning and producing the products for new -- in production for customer qualifications. In turn, these technologies will really not be contributing to the revenue shipments through our fiscal year '23 until late in fiscal year '23, they will be the primary drivers of bit growth and revenue growth and of course, cost reductions in fiscal year '24. Because we will be again relying on using the inventory to supplement our reduced supply growth to meet the uptick in demand that we expect in fiscal year '23.
Brian Chin: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session as well as today's program. Thank you ladies and gentlemen for your participation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Farhan. Good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered record quarterly revenue with strong profitability and free cash flow, enabled by our team’s excellent execution and our industry-leading technology and product portfolio. Micron achieved revenue records in the auto, industrial and networking markets, and in SSDs for both data center and client. Our NAND business delivered record quarterly revenue, and our Embedded Business Unit and Storage Business Unit NAND revenues also hit all-time highs. Our 1-alpha DRAM and 176-layer NAND ramps are several quarters ahead of the industry and progressing well as we continue to qualify new products that use these nodes. The Micron team delivered these excellent results despite supply chain challenges and COVID-19 control measures in China, which impacted our business on both the demand side and the supply side. There are consumer demand and inventory-related headwinds impacting the industry and consequently our fiscal Q4 outlook. However, we remain confident about the secular demand for memory and storage, the attractiveness of our market opportunity, Micron’s excellent competitive position and strong execution capabilities, and our cross-cycle financial model. Micron is leading the industry in both DRAM and NAND technology, and we are also well-poised to continue this lead into calendar 2023. In DRAM, our 1-alpha node ramp is several quarters ahead of the industry, and in fiscal Q3, 1-alpha represented the largest DRAM node in our shipment mix. Our newest node, 1-beta, is on track to ramp in manufacturing by the end of calendar 2022. In NAND, our industry-leading 176-layer node continues to grow in mix of sales, having previously reached the majority of our NAND bit shipments in fiscal Q2. This technology node is contributing to a competitive cost structure across our product portfolio, and in FQ3, we achieved several important 176-layer product qualifications. We are also making excellent progress on our 232-layer node and expect to ramp production by the end of calendar 2022. Across the industry, there are cost challenges stemming from supply chain and inflationary pressures; however, we continue to expect our cost reductions to outpace those of the industry this year, driven by excellent productivity improvements in our fabs and the well-executed ramp of our world-class 1-alpha DRAM and 176-layer NAND nodes. Despite COVID-19 control measures in China that created challenges for the global electronics supply chain, Micron’s strong execution enabled record assembly output in fiscal Q3, supporting record quarterly revenue. However, these COVID-19 control measures in China impacted our outsourced assembly and test subcontractors and led to some impact to fiscal Q3 results. Now turning to our end markets. AI, ongoing cloud adoption, EVs and the ubiquitous connectivity offered by 5G are strong secular demand drivers, enabling the memory and storage industry to outpace the broader semiconductor industry. Micron’s product portfolio has become significantly stronger, and we have established product momentum in several attractive growth markets. We are also driving a portfolio mix shift toward higher growth and more stable markets. Fiscal 2021’s 55 to 45 revenue split in favor of the more mature mobile, PC and consumer markets is expected to shift, by fiscal 2025, to a 38 to 62 split in favor of the higher growth data center, auto, industrial, networking and graphics markets. Several of these end markets also exhibit more stable profitability. Our fiscal Q3 new product launches and customer qualifications reflect solid execution toward this portfolio transformation. Data center is the largest market for memory and storage today, and the rapid growth of AI and memory-intensive workloads ensures that it will sustain strong growth through the end of the decade. Corporations around the world are investing in digitization and extracting more value from data, and this approach remains one of the primary ways of improving efficiency and driving competitive advantage. Data center fiscal Q3 revenue grew by a double-digit percentage sequentially and well over 50% year-over-year. Data center end demand is expected to remain strong in the second half of calendar 2022, driven by robust cloud CapEx growth. Despite the strong end demand, we are seeing some enterprise OEM customers wanting to pare back their memory and storage inventory due to non-memory component shortages and macroeconomic concerns. In fiscal Q3, we achieved several product and customer milestones. We began volume shipments of HBM2E, one of the fastest-growing product categories, driven by the growth in AI and machine-learning workloads. Micron continues to lead in DDR5; however, delays in the rollout of new server CPU platforms have slowed the industry DDR5 ramp versus prior expectations. In data center SSDs, we more than doubled revenue year-over-year and achieved a new revenue record in the fiscal third quarter. We are excited by the strong reception of our industry-leading 176-layer data center NVMe SSDs, which are already in volume production, and in fiscal Q3, we completed qualifications with three OEMs. We recently launched the world’s first 176-layer data center SATA SSD, which will help sustain our industry leadership in this product category. In fiscal Q3, we achieved client revenue growth in the mid-teens percentage range sequentially, driven by DRAM shipments and share gains in client SSD. A number of factors have impacted consumer PC demand in various geographies. As a consequence, our forecast for calendar 2022 PC unit sales is now expected to decline by nearly 10% year-over-year from the very strong unit sales in calendar 2021. This compares to an industry and customer forecast of roughly flat calendar 2022 PC unit sales at the start of this calendar year. We expect PC per unit memory and storage content growth trends to remain healthy in calendar 2022, driven by a mix shift toward enterprise PCs and the increasing content in new architectures such as Apple’s M1 Ultra platform, which features up to 128 gigabyte of DRAM. Micron has a strong product portfolio and is well-positioned in this market. We are leading the DDR5 transition and expect our DDR5 revenue to continue to grow as multiple client customers launch next-generation notebooks. Increased availability of non-memory bill of materials will also improve our ability to ship DDR5-based modules. In addition, we continue to lead the industry in client QLC SSD technology and expect QLC to increase as a percentage of 176-layer bit output in fiscal Q4 and beyond. In fiscal Q3, graphics revenue grew at a strong double-digit percentage rate sequentially and year-over-year, driven by the strength of Micron’s products and customer relationships. Micron continues to be the industry performance leader in graphics. We announced volume shipments of our new 1z 16 gigabit GDDR6X in fiscal Q3, which features twice the capacity and up to 15% higher performance than the previous 1y generation. The 24 gigabit per second peak bandwidth of GDDR6X is made possible by Micron’s groundbreaking PAM4 signal transmission technology. No other memory vendor offers this capability or level of performance. We also began volume shipments of our newest 1z 16 gigabit GDDR6 product to our largest graphics customers. Fiscal Q3 mobile revenue declined slightly year-over-year but grew quarter-over-quarter due to strong customer partnerships and product execution. Smartphone unit sales expectations have declined meaningfully for calendar 2022. We are now projecting smartphone unit volume to decline by mid-single-digits percent range year-over-year in calendar 2022, well below the industry and customer expectation earlier in the year of mid-single-digit percentage growth. 5G unit sales are expected to grow and reach approximately 50% penetration of the smartphone unit TAM this year. The growth of 5G units will also drive higher DRAM and NAND content. We continue to deliver key mobile customer qualifications and strong mobile product ramps on our leading nodes. In fiscal Q3, we expanded our 1-alpha LPDRAM leadership with the industry’s first ramp of 1-alpha LPDDR5. In addition, 176-layer NAND made up over 90% of our mobile NAND bit shipments. Micron is the market share and quality leader in the fast-growing auto and industrial end markets, and in fiscal Q3, we achieved record revenue in both. These markets also exhibit higher stability in their gross margin profile through the cycle. Auto growth has been driven by robust demand that remains constrained by auto unit production. We see robust auto content growth as OEMs adopt significant architectural changes to support ADAS, infotainment and electric vehicles. In fiscal Q3, there were announcements of several new EVs featuring content-rich ADAS, including the Ford F-150 Lightning, Mercedes EQS SUV and EQE sedan, and BMW iX1. We expect the auto market to have a strong long-term bit growth CAGR in DRAM and NAND that is roughly twice the CAGR of the overall DRAM and NAND markets, and consequently our strength in this market will become increasingly important. Industrial IoT achieved record revenue in fiscal Q3, demonstrating broad-based growth with various end market applications. We continue to see tailwinds from secular growth drivers as industrial customers invest in increasing factory automation and digitization. Turning to the market outlook. Our expectations for calendar 2022 industry bit demand growth have moderated since our last earnings call. Near the end of fiscal Q3, we saw a significant reduction in near-term industry bit demand, primarily attributable to end demand weakness in consumer markets, including PC and smartphone. These consumer markets have been impacted by the weakness in consumer spending in China, the Russia-Ukraine war, and rising inflation around the world. COVID-19 control measures in China have exacerbated supply chain challenges for some customers, and the macroeconomic environment is also creating some caution amongst certain customers. Several customers, primarily in PC and smartphone, are adjusting their inventories, and we expect these adjustments to take place mostly in the second half of calendar 2022. While end demand in the mobile, PC and consumer markets has weakened, cloud, networking, automotive and industrial markets are showing resilience. Due to weaker demand in the second half of calendar 2022, we now expect year-over-year calendar 2022 industry bit demand growth to be below the long-term CAGRs of mid-to-high-teens percentage for DRAM and high-20s percentage for NAND. Despite the near-term weakness, secular demand trends remain strong, and our view of long-term DRAM and NAND bit demand CAGR remains unchanged from prior expectations. Turning to supply. Given the change in market conditions, we are taking immediate action to reduce our supply growth trajectory. To protect profitability, we will maintain pricing discipline, manage capacity utilization, and use inventory as a buffer to navigate through this period of demand weakness. Additionally, we are planning for a reduced level of bit supply growth in fiscal 2023 and will use inventory to supply part of the market demand next year. This approach will enable us to reduce wafer fab equipment CapEx for fiscal year 2023 versus our prior plans, and we now expect our fiscal 2023 wafer fab equipment CapEx to decline year-over-year. Overall industry supply is also being impacted. Manufacturing equipment shipment delays, challenges for some in the industry in ramping new nodes of technology and DRAM supply discipline evident in the industry are all expected to limit supply growth over the next few quarters. These supply reductions will help offset some impact of the weaker demand. I will now turn it over to Mark Murphy, Micron’s Chief Financial Officer.
Mark Murphy: Thanks, Sanjay. Micron delivered strong results in fiscal Q3, marked by record quarterly revenue and $1.3 billion of free cash flow. Total fiscal Q3 revenue was $8.6 billion, up 11% sequentially and up 16% year-over-year. Growth was strong across most end markets. Fiscal Q3 DRAM revenue was $6.3 billion, representing 73% of total revenue. DRAM revenue increased 10% sequentially and was up 15% year-over-year. Sequentially, bit shipments increased by slightly over 10% while ASPs declined slightly. Fiscal Q3 NAND revenue was $2.3 billion, representing 26% of Micron’s total revenue. NAND revenue increased 17% sequentially and was up 26% year-over-year. Sequential bit shipments increased in the high-teens percent, and ASPs declined slightly. Now turning to our fiscal Q3 revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the Compute and Networking Business Unit was $3.9 billion, up 13% sequentially and up 18% year-over-year. Data center, graphics and networking contributed to both year-over-year and sequential growth. Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was approximately $2 billion, up 5% sequentially and down 2% year-over-year. Strong execution and product momentum allowed MBU to deliver sequential growth in a challenging smartphone market demand environment. Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $1.3 billion, up 15% sequentially and up 33% year-over-year. We achieved record SSD revenue, with both data center and client SSD revenues reaching all-time highs. Data center SSD revenue more than doubled year-over-year. Finally, we achieved record revenue for the Embedded Business Unit at $1.4 billion, up 12% sequentially and up 30% year-over-year. Both automotive and industrial revenues set records in the quarter. The consolidated gross margin for fiscal Q3 was 47.4%, down approximately 40 basis points sequentially. An increasing mix of NAND contributed to the decline. Operating expenses in fiscal Q3 were approximately $950 million, below the low end of the guidance range and down approximately $20 million sequentially. OpEx benefited from the timing of our technology and product qualifications and from lower variable compensation. Although we are taking actions to reduce OpEx in light of current market conditions, we expect OpEx to increase sequentially due to the timing of technology and product qualifications. Fiscal Q3 operating income was $3.1 billion, resulting in an operating margin of 36.4%, up approximately 110 basis points sequentially and up 450 basis points from the prior year. Fiscal Q3 adjusted EBITDA was approximately $5 billion, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 57.4%, down approximately 40 basis points sequentially and up over 400 basis points versus the prior year. Non-GAAP earnings per share EPS in fiscal Q3 were $2.59, up from $2.14 in fiscal Q2 and up from $1.88 in the year-ago quarter. Turning to cash flows and capital spending. We generated $3.8 billion in cash from operations in fiscal Q3, representing 44% of revenue. Capital expenditures were $2.5 billion during the quarter. We expect fiscal 2022 CapEx to be approximately $12 billion. Our free cash flow for fiscal Q3 was $1.3 billion. During the quarter, we completed share repurchases of $981 million or approximately 13.8 million shares. Including our dividend payment, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders in fiscal Q3. Since the share repurchase program’s inception in fiscal 2019 through the end of fiscal Q3, we have deployed $5.7 billion toward repurchasing 108 million shares at an average price of approximately $53 per share. As we discussed at Investor Day, we are committed to returning to shareholders all of the free cash flow generated over the cycle through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Share repurchases will be both programmatic and opportunistic, and we expect to purchase more as the stock trades at bigger discounts to intrinsic value. On dividends, our Board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.115 per share, a 15% increase over the prior dividend, to be paid on July 26th to shareholders of record on July 11th. Our ending fiscal Q3 inventory was $5.6 billion, and average days of inventory for the quarter were down to 109 days from 113 days last quarter. We ended the quarter with $12 billion of cash and investments and $14.5 billion of total liquidity. Our fiscal Q3 total debt was $7 billion. Now turning to our outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter. Long-term demand trends remain constructive; however, select market weakness and macroeconomic uncertainty are impacting our near-term outlook and visibility. Currently, we do project sequential bit shipments to be down for both DRAM and NAND in fiscal Q4. We intend to maintain pricing discipline and walk away from business which doesn’t meet our pricing objectives. While we are taking proactive steps to control OpEx and CapEx, we expect the impact of these actions to be limited in fiscal Q4 and to become more material in fiscal year ‘23. With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for the fiscal Q4 is as follows. We expect revenue to be $7.2 billion, plus or minus $400 million; gross margin to be in the range of 42.5%, plus or minus 150 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $1.05 billion, plus or minus $25 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 9% for fiscal Q4. Based on a share count of approximately 1.13 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $1.63, plus or minus $0.20. We remain on track to deliver record revenue and solid profitability and free cash flow in fiscal year 2022. In closing, we delivered strong results in our fiscal Q3, but near-term headwinds are impacting our fiscal Q4 outlook. Beyond the near term, we project secular growth drivers such as data center, automotive and other areas to support robust DRAM and NAND growth and strong cross-cycle financial performance by Micron. At our Investor Day event last month, we laid out a cross-cycle financial model for the Company that reflects the key attributes of our business: a strong revenue growth CAGR of high single digits, robust cross-cycle operating margins of approximately 30%, and healthy free cash flow margins that exceed 10% of revenues. Given our long-term financial outlook and the strength of our balance sheet, we see the current share price as very attractive and, at these levels, intend to repurchase shares more aggressively in fiscal Q4. I will now turn it back to Sanjay.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Mark. The memory and storage TAM is expected to grow to $330 billion by 2030 and become an increasing portion of the semiconductor market. The near-term market environment notwithstanding, we are executing extremely well on all aspects of the business that are within our control. Micron’s continuing technology, product and manufacturing leadership puts us in an excellent position to capitalize on the long-term opportunity and to extend the frontiers of what is possible with memory and storage. We will continue to exercise supply discipline and take appropriate actions to navigate through the near-term headwinds, and we remain focused on creating value for shareholders and generating healthy free cash flow cross cycle. Thanks for joining us today. We will now open for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of JP Morgan.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On the data center business, as you guys mentioned, I mean, enterprise CIOs are concerned on the macro outlook and pulling back on their spending budgets. Cloud remains strong. But within that, we’ve heard that continue -- there’s continued strength from the U.S. cloud service providers, but a pullback in spending from the China cloud customers. Are you guys seeing these dynamics within your cloud segment? And then, on the supply side, again, within your cloud business, can you discuss the level of inventories in the channel and at customers that feed into the cloud segment? Because we’re hearing that kind of similar to enterprise that inventories in the cloud channels are also pretty elevated, but wanted to get your views.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thanks, Harlan, for the question. And before I answer the question, I just wanted to note here that we have Sumit Sadana, our Executive Vice President and Chief Business Officer here as well. As you may recall, Sumit was with us in the last earnings call. And in the given environment, I thought it would be good to have him here to add any color to the market environment related specific questions. So, with respect to the question you asked regarding the enterprise server OEM side of the business. There, yes, as we noted that we have seen some inventory adjustment, particularly given their concerns on the macro environment as well as certain supply chain shortages that they may be experiencing. However, on the enterprise server OEM side, the end market demand continues to be healthy as well. And same thing on the cloud side as well that the end market demand for cloud is healthy, cloud demand to us is relatively healthy as well. Of course, cloud also carries elevated levels of inventory versus the pre-COVID level of investments versus the pre-COVID level of inventory. And of course, the cloud investments in CapEx continued to be at a strong clip in their infrastructure, and that bodes well for memory and storage. And I think what’s important is that the overall trend of digitization and use of data to help drive greater productivity and efficiency in businesses, particularly in the backdrop that the world is facing today with the macroeconomic uncertainties is helpful in driving greater technology adoption across industries, and that’s where memory and storage plays out well as well. And specifically, with respect to China and U.S., of course, in China, as we have pointed out earlier, we have seen overall weakness and certainly weakness on the consumer demand side from China as well as some other parts of the world. But we are not really breaking it down between China and U.S. at this point. But again, the overall cloud trends continue to be healthy in terms of the end demand. Sumit, do you want to add any comment on channel customers in terms of inventory?
Sumit Sadana: Yes. I mean, I think the inventory level, as Sanjay said, is higher on the cloud customer side and generally on the data center side compared to where it was pre-COVID. The channel business on the cloud side is relatively in a better place compared to the consumer business challenges that Sanjay highlighted. But of course, different customers have different strategies on how they manage their particular inventory. And the smaller customers in the channel that focus on data center products have had more challenges getting their hands on some of these products that are in shortage like NIC cards to complete server builds, and the smaller customers are getting more impacted there than some of the bigger customers.
Sanjay Mehrotra: And Harlan, I’ll tell you that we work very closely with our customers. I mean our team here, Sumit, myself, I mean, we really engage very closely with our customers across our ecosystem partners here - in China as well as here in the U.S. and worldwide. So, of course, we are keeping close tabs on how the business environment is evolving.
Operator: Our next question comes from C.J. Muse of Evercore.
C.J. Muse: I guess, first question, can you speak to the magnitude of the correction for both DRAM and NAND, how you see that playing out? I’m assuming here that it’s a much larger impact on the DRAM side for you and should be thinking maybe bits down kind of in the low teens. Is that the right way to think about it?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So certainly, on the -- in terms of inventory adjustments that are primarily happening in the smartphone and the PC market. Of course, those inventory adjustments are happening in NAND as well as in DRAM. And clearly, as we have said that in terms of overall demand projection for this year, we definitely see it below -- for DRAM below the guidance we had provided earlier as well as the longer term CAGR for DRAMs mid-teens to high teens. So, we see that below that trajectory. And in terms of NAND, same thing that earlier we had said that the CAGR is high 20s, and we see that in calendar year ‘22 coming in below that. Again, adjustments are happening with respect to inventory both in smartphone and PC market. And just keep in mind that compared to earlier in the year estimation for PC growth, we now are projecting that PC year-over-year in calendar year ‘22 will be down nearly 10%. Similarly, smartphone at the start of the year was expected to grow in mid-single digits in terms of total unit sales worldwide year-over-year and now, one is looking at a decline of mid-single digits. So, a swing of 10% in smartphones as well. If you were to translate it into units, it amounts to like 130 million units reduction versus expectation earlier in the year for smartphone. And similarly for PC, let’s say, 30 million kind of reduction in terms of total units versus the projections earlier in the year. And of course, PC and smartphone combined represent half of the memory and storage worldwide demand in terms of bits, right? So, with this adjustment primarily happening in the second half of this year in these two markets, clearly that is resulting in a year-over-year change versus prior expectations in DRAM as well as NAND demand growth.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. As a follow-up, Mark, you talked about WFE trending lower in fiscal ‘23. Can you give an idea of the magnitude there? And then, how should we think about overall CapEx trending into fiscal ‘23?
Mark Murphy: Yes. C.J., as mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect to end fiscal ‘22 at around $12 billion, so -- on total CapEx. So that would be an uptick in Q4. And that’s consistent with previous statements. Now, with bit supply growth assumptions coming off versus previous group -- the view, we’re actively working to bring spend down. And as you say, we’re confident that as we sit here today, WFE spend will be down in fiscal ‘23. We’re also evaluating construction and other large areas of spend. We’re looking to reduce utilization on some older nodes to maintain supply and drive CapEx for use and shift production to more cost-effective nodes, doing a number of things. And the market is dynamic. So, this is real time. I’m not going to size the reduction next year just at this point because it’s still moving. But at this point, we’re confident that WFE will decline year-over-year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Krish Sankar of Cowen and Company.
Krish Sankar: I have two quick ones. First one, Sanjay or Sumit, I kind of have different way of asking the cloud question. As you mentioned, mobile and PC are slow, but it seems like data center the next year to drop, but yet, you seem optimistic about data center to remain strong in the second half 2022, but you also said cloud inventory is high. So, it seems like if consumer spending slows, which it is, data center CapEx is a drift. So, love to hear your thoughts why you think overall, the U.S. cloud trends, one, drop in the second half of this year? And then a quick follow-up question for maybe Mark was on the impact of the China Shanghai COVID-19 lockdown. Is there a way to quantify what it was in the May quarter and what it means to second half output for Micron?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So earlier, I provided some color regarding our view on cloud. I think I will ask Sumit just to add some further color on that. And Sumit, maybe you can just take the China question as well.
Sumit Sadana: Yes, sure. So, Krish, very quick on the cloud discussion. As Sanjay mentioned, the CapEx trends for our customers in the cloud space continue to be pretty strong and the end demand for cloud services and the growth in those cloud services continues to be robust. And so, of course, like you also pointed out, I mean, the inventory levels are higher compared to where they were pre-COVID. Now, it remains to be seen how the macroeconomic environment is going to cause the cloud spending trends to modulate over time. But if anything, we think that the cloud spending trends are going to be pretty secular, pretty strong. Even if there is some kind of an impact, it will come back strongly as things stabilize. And even companies that do focus on tightening their belt in this macroeconomic environment will continue to look for ways to become more efficient, become more profitable, improve their competitive positioning. And that means extracting more value from data, digitization trends to continue. So, those kind of things, we feel are going to be well sustained through the environment that may happen. But of course, a lot depends on how the macroeconomic environment evolves, and that’s why we are staying very close with customers. Switching to your China question. China has been a pretty significant impact to our FQ4 trajectory. This time last quarter when we were contemplating our FQ4 trajectory compared to that to our latest guidance that we have provided. Our view for China revenue has come down by approximately 30%. And that reduction in the China revenue has caused roughly a 10% reduction in our consolidated company-wide revenue. And so, that’s the impact to the Q4. It’s pretty substantial. And the China impact is largely driven by, of course, smartphone weakness, PC weakness, the general consumer environment there has been weak due to the COVID shutdowns, and that has percolated to different parts of the economy. So, the economic environment is weak. Now, we do feel like given the weakness in that economy, as you know, China does tend to provide stimulus to improve the financial and economic conditions, and we are hopeful that that kind of stimulus and improvement in the economy will be forthcoming in the quarters ahead. The timing of that and how it plays out with further COVID-related issues in China is unclear. But we remain optimistic that over time, the consumer demand will come back and improve things.
Operator: Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri of UBS.
Timothy Arcuri: I guess I had two questions. The first one is for you, Mark. The buyback this quarter was great. But I guess -- and you did say that you’re going to buy back more in August. But I guess I had a bigger picture question around sort of you have an opportunity now with the stock where it is. You have leadership in terms of technology. Where would you be willing to take cash balance to take advantage of this price weakness? I mean, is there a sort of a minimum cash balance that we can think of where you could sort of opportunistically buy back a fairly significant piece of the Company?
Mark Murphy: Yes. Tim, I’m not going to comment on definitively about our rate and pace. As you point out, the balance sheet is stronger than ever. And I think what’s most important there is we’re in a great position to sustain long-term investments as the markets a bit softer here. We’ve got $14.5 billion of liquidity, which you point out, $12 billion of that’s in cash. And that is above a liquidity target that we had set of about 35%. We’re 10 points over that. Leverage is low, 0.4% on gross and we’re in a net cash position. So, no near-term maturities, average debt maturity out 2031. So we’re in great shape. I think we want to maintain a balance sheet to be able to focus on the long term of the business. As you point out, we did return historically high levels to shareholders in third quarter. At these share price levels, we project opportunistic repurchase to increase. And then from there, we’re just focused on free cash flow growth, returning excess cash to shareholders and importantly, maintaining investment-grade rating. So, I’d say, we have ample liquidity now to repurchase at a higher rate this quarter.
Timothy Arcuri: Cool. Thanks for that. And I guess, second question also, Mark, for you. What does the guidance assume for your inventories in August? And sort of how do you think about sort of the balance between holding some inventory if you believe that data center will stay strong and sort of how should we think about inventory in August and sort of your bigger picture strategy around keeping some inventory on the bet that cloud does remain strong?
Mark Murphy: It’s a good question, Tim. And you heard Sanjay talk about this briefly in his prepared remarks. Our strategy is to manage supply through inventory as a buffer and we did talk about reducing bit supply growth assumptions a bit. We are starting this sort of softer period in a pretty good place. We ended the third quarter $5.6 billion of inventories, 109 days, down from 113 days in 2Q. So, we do expect inventories to go up this quarter. And that will build in some flexibility as we work to optimize price on our products. I want to note, it’s cost-effective inventory, much of it built on leading nodes. And so, it will be competitive for a long time. And then, we’ll also use this inventory build to revisit some CapEx decisions and defer CapEx, optimize the manufacturing footprint where we can. And to CJ’s earlier question, it gives us more confidence that we can lower WFE spend next year. So, in the -- we expect it to go up a couple of weeks and days in the fourth quarter. From there, we’ll have to see how the market develops and which way it moves. We are -- we do have more complex wafer processing and more complex module products that are sort of adding some pressure on the days, but we’re also offsetting that with better cycle time, lower stock levels and so forth. So, I think the days that we would be uncomfortable with is a number that we’ve talked about in the past, around 150 days where we start to -- that’s too high a level. So, we would definitely go up in the fourth quarter, and then we’ll see where inventory levels go from there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vivek Arya of Bank of America.
Vivek Arya: Sanjay, I’m curious, do you think this Q4 outlook is the bottom of the cycle, or do you think the risks can extend into Q1? Because you mentioned that the consumer headwinds could continue to play out during the second half of the calendar year and also because cloud inventory is at elevated levels. So, I guess, my specific question as much as I realize you don’t guide out more than a quarter is, do you think Q1 sales and margins are more likely to be flat, up or down sequentially?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So clearly, we don’t guide to Q1 here. But as I pointed out in the prepared remarks that we expect these inventory adjustments to be working themselves out over the course of second half of the year. We have pointed out that the inventory adjustments primarily are taking place in PC and the smartphone market. And I’ll just point out that from the past history as well, that once inventory adjustments begin in a certain part of the segment, then it takes a couple of quarters for them to work out. And here, we, of course, have macroeconomic uncertainties as well. It has been a rapidly changing and uncertain environment. And this is what we have to keep in mind when we look at when does normally see return in terms of demand. And that’s why, just like Mark pointed out here in response to the last question, we will be using inventory to address the demand next year. And we will continue to closely with our customers to understand their overall demand environment. We think that sometime in fiscal ‘23 is when -- in our fiscal ‘23 is when demand will rebound, but more importantly, it’s really about the supply-demand balance. And with respect to supply-demand balance, you can see, that we are taking actions immediately in terms of curtailing our supply growth for fiscal year ‘23 by sharing the plans with you that we are bringing down our CapEx versus our estimations earlier. So, that’s an important step. And of course, industry has shown that in DRAM that it has CapEx discipline as well. We believe our actions will also contribute toward returning the industry health sooner. So, I would expect that sometime in our fiscal year ‘23 demand will rebound as well as industry demand supply environment, there’s a store to a healthy level. But again, I will point out that, look, this is a highly uncertain rapidly changing environment. We are, of course, responding fast and -- in terms of any changes we see. So we are not been pointing to any specific quarter at this time. And again, I think what’s also important is that Micron execution continues to be really strong. I mean, whether you look from technology, product, manufacturing, customer relationships and of course, our strong balance sheet, we are well poised to emerge stronger on the other side of this downturn. So, we are really executing well, working closely with our customers to understand the latest demand trends in various end market segments and adjusting our plans as necessary and as fast as we can, and really positioning the Company for overall healthy growth in the long term. And again, the long-term trends -- as Sumit also pointed out earlier, and I shared with you, the long-term trends absolutely bode well for memory and storage.
Vivek Arya: How much is cloud inventory above a normal level, $100 million, $200 million? Any kind of rough estimation of how much of incremental headwind is that, so we can take that into account? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Look, I mean, it really varies by customer to customer, right? So I mean, we can’t exactly give you some of those details here.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava of BMO.
Ambrish Srivastava: Sanjay, good to see the financial and the CapEx discipline. With respect to supply growth and you’re ramping down supply growth heading into fiscal -- for fiscal ‘23. What’s the right way to think about demand growth? And so, within the supply meeting demand, how much do you think will be production growth, production supply versus coming from the inventory from the industry? Because I think the industry seems to be consistent in that, at least what we heard a week or two ago from one of your large competitors is also lowering CapEx. So, that’s the good part. But what -- how should we think about inventory on the balance sheet of the three participants adding to the production supply growth? And then, I had a quick follow-up for Mark as well, please.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So look, I mean, we are in the process of firming up our plans. And when we have our FQ4 earnings call in September, of course, we will share with you some more details around calendar year ‘23. That will be more appropriate time for us to be talking about it, as well as our fiscal year ‘23. But again, the important thing to note is that our inventory is highly cost effective. I mean, Micron is leading the industry with our DRAM and NAND production nodes, right? We are several quarters ahead. So, this is a highly cost-effective inventory. Our manufacturing operations are running well. So, we will be using this inventory in fiscal year ‘23 and of course, continue to adjust our plans as necessary on the CapEx and front-end wafer technology ramps, et cetera, to bring balance into demand and supply, and which is what I pointed out earlier that overall, the combination of our inventory as well as new production growth that’s how we’re positioned to bring that into balance to meet the demand sometime in fiscal ‘23.
Ambrish Srivastava: Got it. And Mark, real quick one on the WFE versus non-WFE, what’s the percentage? And I respect the fact that plans are still in flux, so you can’t give us a number for ‘23. But what’s the number expected to be for this year, please? Thank you.
Mark Murphy: I’m sorry, Ambrish. I couldn’t hear the question.
Ambrish Srivastava: Sorry. My question was, what’s the wafer front end versus non-wafer front end spend in the CapEx for this year?
Mark Murphy: Okay. I got the mix of spend. I won’t give an exact number because the mix varies from year-to-year and depends on product cycles, availability of fab space and facilities and other factors. Over half of CapEx generally is manufacturing WFE, and then, the other half is split between development CapEx and construction.
Ambrish Srivastava: So, when you say you will be -- you could take down construction as well, that means construction as well as development, or what’s the right way to think about the kind of the playbook is what everybody is looking for if things continue to…
Mark Murphy: Just to be specific, we’re talking about WFE for manufacturing, and that’s what I was addressing would go down year-over-year. We did not commit to going down year-over-year on construction, nor on technology development. I did say though that depending on how the market plays out here and inventory levels and supply bit growth and so forth, we continue to look at our footprint. That’s a continuous process to optimize the amount of spend. So, again, just to make sure that’s clear, WFE over half, and then the rest is construction spend -- equipment spend for R&D and assembly and test.
Ambrish Srivastava: Got it. Thank you. And again, I apologize if misinterpreted your comments. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Aaron Rakers: I just wanted to ask in this environment, these last couple of quarters and at the Analyst Day, you emphasized how much of your business you had kind of line of sight in terms of kind of the long-term agreements that you’ve established. I’m curious, as we’ve gone through this kind of correction or downturn, how would you characterize your discussions on those long-term commitments? Have they changed at all? Have customers pushed back on taking the amount of previously committed supply from you guys. How has that changed at all as we go through this kind of correction right now?
Sanjay Mehrotra: That’s a great question, and I will have Sumit address it.
Sumit Sadana: Yes. Happy to talk about that. So, the long-term agreements, generally, we go out four quarters, talk about volume in each quarter. And as I have pointed out in the past, these are not meant to be take-or-pay agreements, but more meant for planning and shared assumptions and so on. We have had extensive discussions. We keep having ongoing dialogue with our customers about the environment. We obviously continue to press our customers to stick with the agreements and the quarterly SKU, et cetera, as much as possible. But, when there are such significant extraneous events that are happening, exogenous shock sometimes to the environment and such unpredictable type of situations that Sanjay was highlighting, fast-changing environment that is causing impact to the end demand, especially given some of the consumer spending shifts that are happening in the world that are causing reductions in purchasing of certain electronics products, PCs, smartphones, et cetera. Then it is not possible for our customers to purchase based on the LTAs that were established when the assumptions around the industry were very different. And so, our goal then is to work with our customers to come up with the best approach and figure out how best to position ourselves in terms of the forward-looking views of their purchasing patterns. And this is where I feel like the product momentum that we have had has played out really well. We just mentioned that our data center SSD revenue doubled in the most recent quarter year-on-year. We have tremendous product portfolio momentum across all of our products. We are shipping in volume, HBM products. We have the world’s fastest graphics DRAM product, first to market with low power DRAM and mobile and really strong capability in automotive, number one share in auto, industrial and networking. So, these all play to our strengths with our customers. So, in the areas where we want to improve our portfolio position, improve our share because they are more stable segments in the market or they are more profitable portions of the industry profit pool. That’s where we focus on. And then our portfolio strength really helps enable that transition with customers to make our own business more optimized and more profitable, more steady over time. So, that’s the engagement that we have with customers. And we use those LTAs to then drive those longer-term goals that we have with customers.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our time. That does conclude today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Farhan. Good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered an excellent performance in fiscal Q2 with results above the high end of our guidance. We grew revenue and margins sequentially while driving favorable mix and cost reductions amid ongoing global supply chain challenges. We saw broad-based demand for our products with our SSD products achieving record revenue and our auto market revenue also reaching an all-time high. Execution was outstanding with our industry-leading 1-alpha DRAM and 176-layer NAND technology node ramps delivering strong cost reductions. Our portfolio transformation continues to gain momentum as we lead the industry on the DDR5 transition and grow our mix of NVMe data center SSDs. Following a solid first half, we are on track to deliver record revenue and robust profitability in fiscal 2022 and remain well positioned to create significant shareholder value in fiscal '22 and beyond. In fiscal Q2, 1z and 1-alpha DRAM combined represented the majority of our DRAM bit shipments, while 176-layer NAND represented the majority of our NAND bit shipments. Our 1-alpha DRAM and 176-layer NAND products are achieving excellent yields, providing us with solid front-end cost reductions and contributing meaningful revenue. We qualified additional products on these advanced nodes with a broad set of customers, which sets us up for continued strong revenue ramp in the second half of the fiscal year. We are tracking several quarters ahead of the industry in ramping products based on these leading-edge process technologies. We are also investing to maintain technology leadership for the next decade and making good progress in the development of future technology nodes. Micron is not only a technology leader, but also the industry leader in quality with the majority of our customers ranking us #1. Our leadership in quality is an important differentiator for Micron, particularly in fast-growing data center and automotive markets, where our quality scores are excellent. We have also strengthened our position as a strategic supplier to our customers as demonstrated by our commitment to supply continuity amid ongoing semiconductor supply chain challenges this past quarter. In late December, a government-mandated COVID-19 lockdown impacted production output at our back-end facility in Xian, China. The Micron team executed with tenacity to return the Xian site back to normal output levels post lockdown. As a result of this outstanding effort, we mitigated the lost output from Xian and delivered on our customer commitments for the quarter by leveraging our global manufacturing network. Additional COVID-19-related lockdowns in the region present a risk to the global electronic supply chain, and we continue to monitor the situation closely. The global semiconductor supply chain is experiencing pressure due to impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The region is an important source for the global supply of noble gases and other critical minerals that are used in semiconductor manufacturing. We have strategically diversified our supply chain over the last several years and maintained appropriate inventories of materials and noble gases. We currently do not expect any negative impact to our near-term production volumes because of the Russia-Ukraine war, but we do expect an increase in our costs as we secure supply of certain raw materials that could be at risk. We also remain vigilant in this dynamic situation and are engaged with our key suppliers to ensure continuous availability of materials to support our operations. Now let's review our end markets. Demand for memory and storage is broad, extending from the data center to the intelligent edge and to a growing diversity of user devices. Memory and storage revenue has outpaced the rest of the semiconductor industry over the last 2 decades, and we expect this trend to continue over the next decade, thanks to ongoing advancement of AI, 5G and EV adoption. Our team's execution on strengthening our product portfolio has been outstanding with several new product launches and customer qualifications in fiscal Q2, achievements that we are very proud of. Last year, data center became the largest market for memory and storage, eclipsing the mobile market. Looking ahead, we expect data center demand growth to outpace the broader memory and storage market over the next decade, fueled by secular drivers in cloud and healthy enterprise IT investment. Memory and storage share of server bond costs already exceeds 40%, and this number is even higher for servers optimized for AI and ML workloads. This growth is supported by new heterogenous computing architectures, the increase in data-intensive workloads and ongoing displacement of HDDs by SSDs. In the fiscal second quarter, data center revenue grew more than 60% year-over-year, supported by robust demand across our DRAM and SSD portfolio. We have broadened the qualifications for our 1-alpha DRAM products and are well positioned to support the data center DDR5 transition driven by new CPU platforms, which are targeted to begin ramping later this calendar year and gain momentum in 2023. Following the introduction of our 7400 SSD, in fiscal Q2, we introduced the 7450, which is the industry's first 176-layer vertically integrated data center NVMe SSD. These Gen4 NVMe data center drives are generating an enthusiastic response from our customers. We are making robust progress in our qualifications of these drives with data center customers, which has contributed to a doubling of our fiscal Q2 data center SSD revenues year-over-year. We expect strong growth of data center SSD revenues to continue for the remainder of this fiscal year. In fiscal Q2, we saw recovery in our client revenue driven by strength in enterprise PCs, which more than offset softer consumer and Chromebook demand. We expect that calendar '22 PC unit sales will be flattish versus last year's sales, but we expect solid growth in DRAM and NAND content driven in part by increasing mix of content-rich enterprise desktops and laptops. We are leading the industry's client to DDR5 transition, and our DDR5 revenue continues to increase as multiple PC customers launch next-generation notebooks. Client DDR5 demand continues to outstrip supply, and we are seeing meaningful price premiums over DDR4 alternatives. Building on our QLC leadership, in fiscal Q2, we also launched our 2400 NVMe SSD, the world's first client SSD built on 176-layer QLC NAND. Micron maintains a leading position in the fast-growing graphics market. We have a broad product portfolio, featuring industry-leading product performance and deep partnerships with leading GPU suppliers. In fiscal Q2, revenues grew year-over-year driven by strong demand for the latest generation of gaming consoles and graphics cards. Our advanced GDDR6X continues to lead the industry in performance. And in fiscal Q2, we began revenue shipments of our next-generation GDDR6X solutions. Fiscal Q2 mobile revenue grew slightly year-over-year as the 5G transition continues in smartphones. We see some weakness in the China market as the local economy slows, smartphone market share shifts and some customers take a more prudent approach to inventory management. Mobile memory and storage demand continues to be supported by content-hungry applications and the ongoing transition from 4G to 5G, which is driving 50% higher DRAM content and the doubling of NAND content. 5G smartphone sales are expected to grow to 700 million units in calendar year '22. In fiscal Q2, we achieved the first qualification of our 1-alpha LP5 DRAM, which delivers more than a 15% power improvement over the previous generation, enabling our customers to offer an improved 5G experience with better battery life. We are also seeing a very strong revenue ramp for our 176-layer NAND UFS products, which are now qualified in nearly 50 different OEM platforms. The automotive and industrial segments are expected to be the fastest-growing memory and storage markets over the next decade. Today, more than 10% of our revenue comes from these end markets, and we are exceptionally well positioned as a market share leader. In fiscal Q2, our auto revenue set a new record driven by robust demand for memory and storage. Auto unit production remains below demand constrained by numerous supply chain challenges, including logic and analog semiconductor component shortages. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has also impacted auto bills. Nevertheless, the demand for memory and storage remains strong driven by auto content growth. New EVs are becoming like data center on wheels, and we expect over 100 new EV models to launch worldwide in this calendar year alone. These new EVs include advanced ADAS and in-vehicle infotainment features that have significantly higher memory and storage requirements. In fact, some of these Level 3 autonomous EVs have about $750 in memory and storage content, which is 15x higher than the average car. In Industrial IoT, we saw approximately 60% year-over-year revenue growth, fueled by the continued ramp in applications such as factory automation and security systems. Turning to the market outlook. Our expectation for calendar '22 industry demand is largely unchanged from our last earnings call. We expect calendar '22 industry bit demand growth to be in the mid- to high teens for DRAM and at approximately 30% for NAND. We anticipate underlying demand in calendar '22 to be led by data center, ongoing adoption of 5G smartphones and continued strength in automotive and industrial markets.  Currently, we see a healthy supply-demand balance across both DRAM and NAND given these demand trends, supply discipline across the memory industry, long semiconductor manufacturing equipment lead times and reduced NAND supply from some of our competitors that experienced a contamination issue in their fab. Nonmemory component shortages are improving, and we expect that further improvements should support memory and storage demand growth for the rest of this year. However, there are some pockets where semiconductor shortages have not improved as fast as we had expected, and these shortages are likely to continue into calendar year 2023. We are mindful of increased macroeconomic uncertainty and remain vigilant of any changes in market conditions. Turning now to Micron's bit supply growth expectations for the year. Consistent with the rest of the industry, we are experiencing a challenging environment for equipment and material suppliers. However, due to strong execution by Micron's operations team, our calendar year '22 bit supply growth for DRAM and NAND remains unchanged from prior expectations and will be in line with industry demand. We are on track to deliver record revenue with solid profitability in fiscal year '22, and we continue to expect strong bit shipment growth in the second half of the fiscal year. We expect our cost reductions to outpace that of the industry this year driven by the exceptionally well-executed ramp of our world-class 1-alpha DRAM and 176-layer NAND nodes. However, across the industry, there are cost challenges stemming from supply chain and inflationary pressures, which will limit cost reductions this year for the industry. We remain confident in our long-term technology road map and our ability to drive competitive cost reductions for years to come. I will now turn it over to Sumit.
Sumit Sadana: Thanks, Sanjay. Micron delivered excellent fiscal Q2 results marked by record revenues across multiple products and markets, strong profitability and generation of over $1 billion in free cash flow. I'm particularly excited by the execution of our industry-leading 1-alpha DRAM and 176-layer NAND technology ramp and the accelerating momentum of our product portfolio transformation. Fiscal Q2 revenue was approximately $7.8 billion, up 1% quarter-over-quarter and up 25% year over year. Revenue was particularly strong in client and cloud markets. Fiscal Q2 DRAM revenue was $5.7 billion, representing 73% of total revenue. DRAM revenue increased 2% quarter-over-quarter and was up 29% year-over-year. Sequentially, bit shipments increased in the high single-digit percentage range, while ASPs declined in the mid-single-digit percentage range. Fiscal Q2 NAND revenue was $2 billion, representing 25% of Micron's total revenue. NAND revenue increased 4% quarter-over-quarter and was up 19% year-over-year. Sequential bit shipments were flat, and ASPs increased in the mid-single-digit percentage range due to stronger mix of SSDs, more than offsetting like-for-like price declines. Our ongoing portfolio transformation and a solid front-end cost reduction drove sequential gains in gross margin in NAND despite sequential price declines in most products. Now turning to our fiscal Q2 revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the Compute and Networking Business Unit was $3.5 billion, up 2% sequentially and up 31% year-over-year. Cloud generated record DRAM revenue, and client DRAM revenues also performed well in the quarter. Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $1.9 billion, down 2% sequentially and up 4% year-over-year. Our Mobile business continues to perform well, building on our leadership in managed NAND and MCPs as well as our strong relationships with all smartphone customers. Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $1.2 billion, up 2% sequentially and up 38% year-over-year. We achieved record SSD revenues, which were up approximately 80% year-over-year. Our storage business is gaining momentum, growing revenue as well as profitability as we become the first in the industry to ramp several 176-layer NAND SSDs from QLC and TLC client products to vertically integrated data center SSDs. Finally, revenue from the Embedded Business Unit was $1.3 billion, up 5% sequentially and up 37% year-over-year. Our Embedded Business Unit saw strong demand across automotive and industrial markets, with auto revenue hitting a new record. The consolidated gross margin for fiscal Q2 was 47.8%, up approximately 80 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Gross margins benefited from improvements in our portfolio mix as we ramped several high-value solutions and from manufacturing cost reductions. Operating expenses in fiscal Q2 were $974 million, near the midpoint of our guidance range. Fiscal Q2 operating income was strong at $2.8 billion, resulting in an operating margin of 35%, flat quarter-over-quarter and up from 20% in the prior year. Fiscal Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $4.5 billion, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 58%, up from 57% in the prior quarter and up from 45% in the prior year. Non-GAAP earnings per share in fiscal Q2 were $2.14, down slightly from $2.16 in fiscal Q1 and up more than 100% from the $0.98 in the year ago quarter.  The sequential increase in fiscal Q2 tax rate impacted Q2 EPS by $0.04 per share. Turning to cash flows and capital spending. We generated $3.6 billion in cash from operations in fiscal Q2, representing 47% of revenue. Net capital spending was $2.6 billion during the quarter. We continue to expect fiscal 2022 CapEx to be in the range of $11 billion to $12 billion with the CapEx being roughly even between the first and second half of the fiscal year. Our free cash flow for fiscal Q2 was strong at slightly over $1 billion. We remain confident in our ability to generate significant free cash flow in the second half of the fiscal year, substantially higher than that in the first half. We completed share repurchases of $408 million or approximately 4.8 million shares in the quarter. Including our dividend payment, we returned around $520 million to shareholders in fiscal Q2. From the inception of the share repurchase program in fiscal 2019, we have deployed $4.7 billion towards repurchasing 94 million shares at an average price of $50 per share. In addition, we have deployed approximately $800 million towards settling convert premiums, which reduced our diluted share count by 19 million shares. Combining the share repurchases, convert premiums and dividends, we have returned to shareholders $5.8 billion or 64% of our cumulative free cash flow in this time frame. We remain committed to returning more than 50% of the cross-cycle free cash flow through a combination of dividends and buybacks. As we have mentioned before, we will be opportunistic in share repurchases and more aggressive when the shares are trading at larger discounts to intrinsic value. Our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.10 to be paid on April 26 to shareholders of record on April 11. Our ending fiscal Q2 inventory was $5.4 billion, and average days of inventory for the quarter was 113 days. Our fiscal Q2 DIO increased sequentially due to an increase in raw materials and WIP to support demand for the second fiscal half. Finished goods inventory declined quarter-over-quarter in both DRAM and NAND. We ended the quarter with $11.9 billion of total cash and investments and $14.4 billion of total liquidity. Our fiscal Q2 total debt was $7.1 billion. Now turning to our outlook for the fiscal third quarter. Our overall business is tracking ahead of our plans a quarter ago, and demand is strong across most end markets with some regional challenges that Sanjay referenced earlier. Near term supply and pricing trends are constructive. Our improved fiscal year financial outlook is increasing our variable compensation expenses, which will impact our costs in fiscal Q3. We are also seeing cost impacts from continuing inflationary pressures and from supply chain mitigation actions resulting related to industry-wide shortages. Additionally, due to the pull-in of cost reductions in Q2, we expect more modest front-end cost reductions in Q3 on a sequential basis. We do expect both DRAM and NAND gross margins to increase sequentially in fiscal Q3. A higher mix of NAND revenue in our consolidated total will affect our consolidated gross margin as our DRAM gross margins are substantially higher than our NAND gross margins. With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for fiscal Q3 is as follows. We expect revenue to be $8.7 billion, plus or minus $200 million, which will represent a new record for quarterly revenues; gross margin to be in the range of 48%, plus or minus 100 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $1.05 billion, plus or minus $25 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 10% for fiscal Q3. Based on the share count of approximately 1.14 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $2.46, plus or minus $0.10. We remain on track to deliver record revenue and solid profitability and free cash flow in fiscal 2022. In closing, Micron continues to deliver strong cross-cycle performance. Revenue growth has significantly outpaced the broader semiconductor industry, gross margins have averaged over 40%, and operating margins have averaged around 30%. Micron's financial foundation and outlook have never been stronger as we build on the momentum created by our portfolio transformation, leadership technology road map and manufacturing excellence. I will now turn it back to Sanjay.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Sumit. I'm proud to note that earlier this month, Micron was named one of the world's most ethical companies by the Ethisphere Institute. This recognition reflects our global team's dedication to holding ourselves the highest ethical standards both in how we operate and how we pursue environmental and social responsibility. We continue to manage our business with a discipline and foresight that is driving industry-leading technology ramps, improving our product portfolio and strengthening our customer relationships. A strong first half performance and our guidance for an all-time record quarter show our continued progress toward delivering record fiscal '22 revenues and robust profitability. Given our technology leadership, Micron is in an excellent position to capitalize on the broad trends that are driving demand for DRAM and NAND solutions, solutions that transform data into better customer experiences and greater business value. I look forward to seeing you at our Investor Day presentation on May 12 in San Francisco, where we will discuss the technology drivers behind these trends in greater depth and detail Micron's strategies to seize the opportunity ahead. Thanks for joining us today, and we'll now open for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Evercore.
C.J. Muse: I guess first question, as I look at your results, the mix and operational performance is excellent. And as you look ahead to the second half, you did talk about a pull-in of costs in the February quarter, but would be curious to hear how you're thinking about mix, both like-for-like in DRAM and NAND into the second half of the fiscal year and how we should think about kind of the gross margin trajectory from here.
Sumit Sadana: All right. So in terms of the gross margins and the mix, I'll just point out that for FQ2, for example, we had exceptionally strong performance in gross margin due to the ramp of our 1-alpha and 176-layer NAND and our portfolio mix. And our NAND gross margins actually improved due to mix effects alone. And of course, we had good cost reductions in 176-layer NAND. So that momentum is continuing. So as I look forward to FQ3, you have seen that the gross margin guidance at the midpoint is sequentially higher. So we are very positive on our gross margin trajectory going forward. I want to point out a couple of things that are important here. So both NAND and DRAM gross margins are expected to improve sequentially in FQ3. And as you highlighted, we have spoken about some cost improvements that got pulled into FQ2, so that’s going to have little bit of a dampening effect on the cost improvements we will see sequentially. But there are a couple of important factors that are going to affect our FQ3 gross margin by about 100 basis points. The first one is that our variable compensation accrual is increasing sequentially from FQ2 to FQ3 because our overall profitability forecast for the year -- for the fiscal year is quite a bit higher than we were expecting originally. So that is increasing our bonus accrual. That impacts costs in the following quarter. We have already taken that impact in the OpEx for FQ2, but it will impact costs in FQ3. So that's an impact on gross margin sequentially in FQ3. And the other aspect is that our NAND business in FQ3 will grow faster than our DRAM business in FQ3. So that has a little bit of an impact on the consolidated gross margin. So both NAND and DRAM businesses will have sequential improvement, but NAND will grow faster. So mathematically, it will just have a little bit of an impact. So the 2 of these issues between the bonus accrual and the NAND mix has about just over a 100 basis point impact on gross margin going from FQ2 to FQ3. And in spite of that 100 basis point impact, we are forecasting improvement in gross margin in going from FQ2 to FQ3. So overall, really strong margin performance, I feel. And you asked a question about mix. You see that our data center SSD revenue is improving substantially. Sanjay mentioned in his prepared remarks that in FQ2, our revenue doubled year-on-year in the data center. We expect continued growth in the data center in the next couple of quarters as well. So that's a positive for our gross margins. We also have leadership in DDR5. That kind of mix improvement is also good for us because we do have good gross margins there. So overall, we feel positive about the trajectory into FQ3 and very constructive about FQ4 profitability as well. Of course, we are not going to guide for FQ4, so we'll leave it at that for now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities.
Vivek Arya: Interesting to see that the strong outlook, and you're maintaining the full year kind of industry view unchanged also even though there have been some recent kind of softer data points and deceleration in PC and smartphone demand. Is this just the case of data center strength overpowering those headwinds? And what are you doing to make sure that you don't oversupply to the data center?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So certainly, let me take this question. Regarding PC, what I would like to point out is that in PC, enterprise and desktops are strong. Chromebooks and consumer PCs have had some weakness as is well known, but enterprise and desktops are strong. And that's a favorable mix for us because enterprise and desktops take higher content of both DRAM and NAND. So while we look at PC unit growth on a year-over-year basis to be flattish, the enterprise and desktop mix is favorable in terms of DRAM and flash content requirements there. And data center, certainly a strong market for us. Second half of calendar year '22 should be strong for data center because of new CPUs that are expected to be launched, which will be driving greater content in the servers. So data -- and you have heard about various hyperscalers talking about their investments -- their CapEx investments in data center as well. And again, all the workloads related to AI/ML are just driving greater content within the data center space.  But it's not just about data center or the aspects of PC that we just discussed. Of course, 5G smartphones continuing to drive strong DRAM and NAND content as we mentioned; and automotive market, strong growth driver as well. So the point is that the demand is broad-based and demand, we expect to be strong going forward as well. And of course, on the aspect of supply, of course, the supply is contained in the industry because of the discipline on CapEx that has been exercised by the various players. And of course, on the NAND side, the aspect of the contamination issue that impacted a competitor's fab and impacted the supply in NAND in a big way there, too. So overall, healthy environment that we see for -- in terms of DRAM and NAND supply and demand balance through the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer: Congratulations on the strong results. Sanjay, you've spent the last several years trying to reposition the NAND portfolio to higher-value products. I'm kind of curious, relative to the May guide of NAND growing faster sequentially than DRAM, can you help us better understand what products and end markets are really driving that? And is this really the fruits of some of your qualification labors? And as you answer the question, I'd be curious, when you think about NAND gross margins, what's the impact as the mix continues to improve? How much of the gap between NAND and DRAM do you think you can close over time? Or how much more upside do you think there is in the NAND gross margin business over time as you optimize the portfolio?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So certainly, in NAND, I think our team has done a great job in leading the industry by several quarters with 176-layer NAND technology and now deploying it into various products. We talked about in our prepared remarks some of the SSDs that we have introduced now for data center as well being the first ones to introduce data center NVMe SSDs with 176-layer NAND technology with vertically integrated solutions, including our own controllers. Our manufacturing ramp has been excellent as well. They are really exceptionally executed in terms of our yields, in terms of production ramp, in terms of quality. And all the work that we have been putting in over the course of last several years absolutely is coming to fruition here. We have had -- we have enjoyed already the gains in share with respect to mobile-managed NAND solutions both on the MCP side that contain DRAM and NAND solutions as well as on the discrete NAND side. And you have seen how we have grown our share from low single digits a few years ago to now in the high teens in terms of our share in the market. So strong performance already enjoyed on the mobile NAND side of the business. And now SSD is getting absolutely into high gear here. Our client SSDs, our introduction of QLC, 176-layer SSD, our data center NVMe SSDs, all the work that we have vertically integrated solutions with our own controllers, all this work that we have been doing for quite some time is hitting the market now, and we are well positioned to gain share in the SSD space in the client as well as on the data center side. And all of this being built on the foundation of leading, highly cost-effective 176-layer NAND technology positions us well for improvements in our revenue outlook for NAND as well as for our profitability outlook for NAND. And in terms of the differences between DRAM and NAND, of course, as Sumit was just earlier highlighting that there are significant differences in the industry margins of DRAM as well as NAND and certainly for Micron as well. But the point is that our margins in NAND are improving given the accelerating portfolio of momentum we have and our ability to really address wide range of end-market applications from smartphone to client SSDs to data center SSDs as well as strong position in the channel markets as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri of UBS.
Timothy Arcuri: I just had a quick question on cost as well. So if I look at the slide, Sanjay, where you're talking about the current outlook, the verbiage change to basically reflect the fact that you're costing down better this year than the industry. And of course, there are headwinds on cost for the industry this year. But I'm wondering whether your ability to outpace the industry's cost down will also extend into next year. Because if I look at the verbiage on the slide, last quarter, you said that you think that you'll be competitive with the industry over the longer term. So I'm just wondering whether you think that this is a 1-year thing where you're costing down better than the industry? Or is this -- can this be sustained into next year?
Sanjay Mehrotra: We feel really good about our technology road map. And just like we have led the industry with our 1-alpha DRAM as well as with our 176-layer NAND, we certainly plan to lead the industry with our future generation nodes as well, and we are making good progress on those. And those nodes will be introduced sometime in calendar year '23 time frame as well. So really, it's our technology leadership position and our ability to successfully ramp it into production across a broad range of products, is key to our strength in continuing our cost position in the industry. So we feel very good about our cost position versus our competitors going forward as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research.
Pierre Ferragu: I have, first, like very quick simple one on the mobile market. So it's slowing sequentially now. What kind of visibility do you have there? Do you think we are reaching like a -- kind of like plateau in content increase in the kind of growth that 5G generated in that market? Or is that something different and more temporary? And then I have like a broader question for you guys. Your peers in logic are very active on, I would say, the geopolitical front, investing in the U.S., investing in Europe to create a more balanced manufacturing footprint in the world. And we don't hear much about that in the memory market. And so I was wondering if there could be a topic there, if there are conversations and is that something that could benefit Micron at some point.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So it's a great position to be in today that we have Sumit here as interim CFO as well as our Chief Business Officer. So I will actually let him address the first question of yours, and then I will take the second question. Sumit, go ahead with the first one.
Sumit Sadana: Sure, Sanjay. So Pierre, thanks for that question. So in terms of the model average capacities node, we don't see this anywhere close to a plateau of any kind. We are very positive on average content growth in mobile. The 5G transformation in the industry continues in the handset portfolio. So if you think about an industry of about 1.4 billion smartphones approximately being sold on an annual basis, about 500 million or so in calendar 2021 were sold as 5G. We expect a 40% growth to 700 million being sold as 5G handsets this year. And a 5G handset has typically 50% more DRAM content, more than double the NAND content of a 4G handset. So that trend has a lot to run still. And I think on the -- even beyond that, we do expect applications to come up that take advantage of 5G in ways that are going to continue to drive the average capacities for both DRAM and NAND hire. So there's plenty of room to run there. Yes, the smartphone business, we do expect a low single-digit sort of unit volume growth in this calendar year overall for the smartphone volumes, consolidated volumes overall. And average capacity is then on top of that. So the overall growth is going to still be robust. And keep in mind, we are going to enter a seasonally stronger period when new handsets get introduced in the fall for the mobile business. So that's going to be another catalyst as well. So with that, I will pass it over to Sanjay.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Sumit. And Pierre, regarding your second question, so of course, as you know, Micron has made investments over the course of last few years in our clean rooms in the U.S., in Taiwan, in Singapore as well as Japan. In terms of cleanroom expansions in these locations, again, leveraging our globally well-diversified manufacturing footprint, these cleanroom expansions position us to implement the technology transitions in our production. And we have not added new wafer capacity, but we have invested really prudently over the course of last few years in cleanroom expansion, positioning us well to deliver on technology transitions, which are -- which is what is positioning us to drive our cost reductions as well as bit growth in line with the demand growth. As we look ahead, we have announced in October of last year that we would be looking at investing more than $150 billion over 10 years in leading-edge memory manufacturing and R&D on a global basis. So of course, we have also, as part of that, highlighted that in '25-'26 time frame, we would be needing to add new wafer capacity for DRAM in order to continue to meet the increase in demand for the later half of this decade through the 2030 time frame. In that regard, of course, we are evaluating the new expansion on a global basis. And certainly, in the U.S., the discussions that have been proceeding related to chips and the FABS Act, which are about upfront support for investments, new manufacturing capacity as well as ongoing investment tax credits, these are important aspects to help the U.S. bridge the gap with Asia operations.  And these are the things that we will, of course, continue to monitor. And we will be making our decisions regarding future expansions once again that is more about the second half of this decade because until then, we are well positioned with our cleanroom situation in our diversified footprint in various countries, including the U.S. today. And in this regard, we are very much engaged with the U.S. government related to passage of CHIPS and investment tax credits.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mehdi Housseini of SIG
Mehdi Hosseini: One follow-up for Sanjay. How should I think about DDR5 contribution, especially to the operating profit this year, which -- it seems to me mostly driven by the PC end market versus next year where the server application picks up.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks that DDR5, of course, it is a bigger die because of the specs of DDR5. By the way, that has an effect in terms of moderating the supply bit growth in the industry as well as DDR5 continues to ramp in client and, in the future, in the data center space as well. So DDR5, we noted in our remarks, that has a pricing premium in the industry as well. And Micron actually is leading in terms of DDR5 supply capability in the industry today as well. So it is a positive contribution to our overall DRAM margins with DDR5. And certainly, we are getting pricing premium for DDR5 in the industry. And as new processors get deployed widely in the data center space that can make use of DDR5, which are expected to begin later this year, you will see DDR5 continuing to ramp rapidly during calendar year '23 as well. We are well positioned with our DDR5 road map for client as well as for data center market.
Mehdi Hosseini: But there will be a pricing premium for server application versus desktop, correct?
Sanjay Mehrotra: DDR5, as we noted, has pricing premium, yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Danely of Citi.
Chris Danely: So just specifically to DRAM, can you just talk about how the 3 main end markets did relative to your expectations? And then on the guidance, how they did -- or how they're -- you expect them to do relative to the expectations as far as PC, server, data center and mobile?
Sumit Sadana: All right. So Chris, yes, I can take that. So in terms of our end markets, FQ2 was a really good quarter. When we think about PCs, PCs performed well. Mobile performed well. Data center continues to be strong. And in fact, a lot of the gross margin upside that we experienced in FQ2 came from pricing improvements that were driven out of actually both DRAM and NAND, but definitely in DRAM as well versus our expectations. So those markets have been strong in FQ2. And as we look ahead in FQ3, most of our sequential growth in FQ3 is being driven out of the compute market, which is mostly DRAM; and then the storage market, which is mostly NAND. So our Storage Business Unit and our Compute and Networking Business Unit, these 2 business units are going to be the primary drivers of growth. All 4 business units are likely to grow well, but these 2 are going to be exceptional growth drivers sequentially in FQ3. So we do expect continued strength in PC. As Sanjay mentioned, the average capacities are increasing because of the mix improvements in PCs due to the shift towards corporate PCs and laptops away from lower-end consumer. So that's helping there. Data center continues to be robust. We expect the rest of calendar '22 to be robust for data center because a lot of demand growth there at our customers who are allocating significant CapEx increase. And the mobile 5G shift continues to be positive for average capacities. And even though mobile is not going to be a big driver of growth sequentially in FQ3, we do expect it to pick up sequentially in FQ4 because of seasonality and these continued trends.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley.
Joe Moore: You touched on the impact of the contamination issue in NAND at your competitor. Can you talk about how much of a change that was, how tight you think the NAND market may be because of that? And do you expect that -- the impact of that to be durable beyond the current period?
Sanjay Mehrotra: It certainly brought down the year-over-year supply growth for the industry. It had brought it down based on some of the estimates that are out there by a couple of percentage points in terms of, again, the year-over-year industry supply growth. And certainly, that's -- in terms of the demand-supply dynamic in the industry, that's favorable because the demand for all the reasons that we have just discussed, whether it's in data center or in the client applications or on the mobile phones or even in the automotive markets, the demand for NAND along with demand for DRAM continues to increase. And we fully expect a healthy demand-supply balance for the NAND industry as we look ahead.
Operator: Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari: I had a question on NAND ASPs and how to think about the evolution going forward. I think in the February quarter, your ASPs were up mid-single digits sequentially despite the industry environment still being relatively soft from a pricing perspective. Sanjay, just given your comments around your success in data center SSDs and winning some of those important designs, is it fair to assume that your sequential ASP expansion going forward should outperform the industry throughout the year? Is that a fair assumption to be making? And then separately, Sumit, you talked about the headwinds associated with inflationary pressures and the supply chain mitigation actions. I think you said 100 basis points. At what point could that reverse? I know that's a hard question to answer, but should we expect those headwinds to persist for a couple of quarters? Or could those headwinds turn into tailwinds eventually?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Sumit, why don't you go ahead?
Sumit Sadana: Yes. In terms of our cost pressures, certainly, if you look at the overall environment out there, things are continuing to be challenging. And this is an industry-wide statement. So whether you look at the price of oil and natural gas that are important commodities that impact even the price of electricity, to a lot of the other raw materials and commodities that we purchase, noble gases, a lot of these things, even the pricing of OSAT external subcon services. And of course, you're seeing inflation and even foundry logic prices.  So there are lots of vectors. And then, of course, we are also seeing wage inflation happening. So there are lots of vectors through which inflation is getting transmitted into the business. And of course, we are, I believe, doing a really extraordinary job of containing our costs. But of course, these inflationary pressures are there. So we are planning for these pressures to persist for several quarters. We are not thinking that these will let up anytime soon. And so our work is focused on continuing to find efficiencies, continuing to ramp our new technology as fast as we have been doing in an excellent way.  So the rest of it comes from, of course, considering these costs as we think about how we price our products, and of course, driving stronger mix of products so we can get not only good ASPs, but also have positive gross margin benefit of products that have higher ASP, better high-value mix in our portfolio. And that mix improvement is happening on the NAND side. It's also happening on the DRAM side with examples like DDR5. So with that, I'll turn it over to Sanjay.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So I think Sumit touched on the next aspect, which was the first part of your question. And as I think Sumit had highlighted in his prepared remarks that for NAND, even though there was a like-for-like price decline, our -- overall due to the mix, our pricing went up in FQ2. And again, this is just highlighting that how mix is playing an important role. The new products that we are launching with SSDs as well as our mobile-managed NAND solutions and shifting away from components into greater and greater mix of high-value solutions positions us well for continuing to improve the profitability of the business here.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava of BMO.
Ambrish Srivastava: Sumit, I'm a bit confused. I just wanted to make sure I understood the headwind that -- in the prior question. I thought the cost headwind, the 100 bps you called out, that was from the variable comp and had nothing to do with all the mitigation costs that are going on, which should continue for the next several quarters. Is that the case, the 100 bps is mainly --
Sumit Sadana: Yes. Yes, that is -- your understanding is correct. Yes, your understanding is correct. The 100 basis points impact to sequential gross margin in FQ3 versus FQ2 stemmed from the variable comp increase that I mentioned that's going to impact FQ3 as well as the NAND revenue mix that is going to increase in FQ3 and caused an impact to the consolidated gross margin just mathematically. So the sum of the 2 is over 100 basis points and -- 
Sanjay Mehrotra: On the gross margin.
Sumit Sadana: On the gross margin side, that's right.
Ambrish Srivastava: Got it. Got it. So then the question is then -- I'm just trying to unpack this because you talked about inflationary costs. We all understand that. We're feeling it in our own homes. But as you look at the business, you also said that some of the component availability is improving, and that has been a headwind as well to the back-end costs. So I'm just trying to unpack these comments. So on the one hand, you have -- and then you're also having to secure raw materials. I'm assuming neon is part of that. So can you just help us understand kind of what's the right way to think about these costs that could sustain for the next several quarters? So that was my first question. The second one is, thanks for providing that commentary on the inventory. That was very helpful. We had to wait for the Q. The finished goods being down quarter-over-quarter for both DRAM and NAND. That was very helpful. The question is, is that seasonal? Or is there something going on that finished goods system?
Sumit Sadana: Sure. So in terms of the first question about costs, yes, we do expect that the availability of components is going to improve the overall shortages that we have been experiencing quite significantly over the last several quarters. The situation is improving. And as Sanjay said in the prepared remarks, it's not improving to an extent that all of those issues will be gone this year. We expect continuous improvement through the course of calendar '22.  And we expect that because of those improvements in availability, the full demand will be experienced in terms of memory and storage because our customers can now order match sets of products. They can get their hands on all of the components that are short. We can get our hands on more components to build our products. And so that is improving through the calendar year, but there is going to be some components that will shift into -- in calendar '23 in terms of when we expect further improvement. There will be still some shortages. And even though the availability of some of these components is improving, there is a level of cost pressure across the supply chain. And these cost pressures are coming across a range of commodities that we buy, a range of input costs in the way we operate our fabs in back-end facilities. So it's an industry-wide pressure across a range of issues, and they will continue despite the improvements of availability of some components. And now switching to your question about inventory. We have been managing our inventory tightly. So our finished goods inventory is down quarter-on-quarter by design. We have higher levels of WIP, mainly staging for a pretty robust growth in FQ3 sequentially. And you can see that in our guidance. We are growing very robustly in FQ3 compared to FQ2. So we do expect inventory to come down in FQ3 and to end up in pretty much the normal range that we have for the year at the end of FQ4. So we do still have that expectation that we would -- as we had mentioned last quarter as well, we would build inventory ending FQ2 and then reduce inventory in FQ3, FQ4. So that is continuing to be the plan, and that's the set of numbers that you see. Just one last point I last point is part of the inventory increase is to just ensure supply continuity, right? I mean this has been a challenge in terms of getting our hands on all the components we need. So part of it is just ensuring that we have adequate supply on hand to meet our customer demand as we ramp revenue.
Ambrish Srivastava: And so WIP has been going up consistently in the last 2, 3 quarters as a result of that rate?
Sumit Sadana: Yes. Exactly.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2021-12-20 16:30:00) =====

Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Farhan. Good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered outstanding results in fiscal Q1, achieving strong year-over-year revenue growth and solid profitability. Our strong start to the year and our product portfolio momentum keep us on track to deliver record revenue and robust profitability in fiscal 2022. We are rapidly ramping our industry-leading 1-alpha DRAM and 176-layer NAND products and achieving excellent yields, and these products are now shipping across our major end markets. We achieved significant product advancements and customer wins, including launching our first DDR5 solution, introducing our vertically integrated Gen4 NVMe data center SSD, validating the world's first low-power DDR5X with MediaTek and shipping our GDDR6X for AMD's Radeon RX 6000 graphics card. The secular demand for memory and storage, along with Micron's focus on building our technology and product leadership and deepening our customer relationships, continues to strongly position us to create significant shareholder value in fiscal year '22 and beyond. With the successful ramp of 1-alpha DRAM and 176-layer NAND products across major end markets, we are several quarters ahead of the industry in market deployment of these leading-edge process technologies. The combination of 1-alpha and 1Z DRAM nodes represents the majority of our DRAM bit production and 176-layer NAND now accounts for the majority of our NAND bit production. Our strong execution on these advanced nodes sets us up for the successful fiscal year '22. We are also investing to scale our technology for the next decade. We are planning for volume DRAM production on EUV in 2024 with our 1-gamma node. Integrating EUV with our existing multi-patterning immersion lithography expertise will help us maintain DRAM technology leadership for many years to come. And in NAND, we have successfully transitioned to replacement gate and have a road map to scale for several generations while leveraging our leadership in CMOS and early and QLC to maintain a bit density leadership. In addition to being a technology leader, Micron is the industry quality leader with two-thirds of our customers ranking us number one in quality. As a technology and quality leader and as an innovation partner with strong global manufacturing network, we have become a strategic supplier to our customers. And its ongoing semiconductor supply chain challenges, Micron has leveraged our deep related partnerships with customers and suppliers to support DRAM, NAND and NOR supply continuity. On the customer side, we are seeing greater commitment and collaboration on supply planning, including the use of long-term agreements. Today, over 75% of our revenue comes from volume-based annual agreements, a significant increase from five years ago when they accounted for around 10% of our revenue. On the supplier side, we have entered into strategic agreements to secure supply of certain components that we need to manufacture our products. As a result of these agreements, the current tight supply of these components is expected to gradually improve for us throughout calendar 2022. Now let us review our end markets. Demand for memory and storage is broad, extending from the data center to the intelligent edge and to a growing diversity of user devices. Memory and storage revenue has outpaced the rest of the semiconductor industry over the last two decades, and we expect this trend to continue for years to come, thanks to AI, 5G and EV adoption. In addition, the build-out of immersive virtual worlds often referred to as the Metaverse will offer even more opportunity due to the intensive use of significant memory and storage in these applications. Our team's execution on strengthening our product portfolio has been outstanding, with several new product launches and customer qualifications in FQ1, achievements we are very proud of. I will highlight some of these achievements as I discuss our end markets. Data center is the largest market for memory and storage, and we expect it to outpace the broader memory and storage market over the next decade. Memory and storage is growing as a portion of server BOM supported by new and heterogenous computing architectures; the growth of data-intensive workloads and AI; and the ongoing displacement of HDDs by SSDs. In the fiscal first quarter, data center revenue grew more than 70% year-over-year as a result of continued cloud demand and the resurgence of enterprise IT investments. Our strengthening product portfolio also contributed to strong profitability. In Q1, we launched the 7400SSD the first data center NVMe SSD to utilize our internally developed controller and firmware, along with our DRAM and NAND. This Gen4 NVMe product has already been qualified by two key customers. Looking ahead, we expect a strong ramp in our data center SSD revenues in FQ2 driven by increased sales of our NVMe SSD products. In addition, we launched the industry's leading DDR5 and see strong demand as customers prepare for new server product launches in calendar '22. While PC end demand remains strong, our clients revenue declined sequentially due to the PC production impact from ongoing non-memory component shortages and related customer inventory adjustments of DRAM and NAND products. Consistent with the expectations we articulated in our last earnings call, the inventory adjustment at most PC customers is now largely behind us, and we are seeing signs of stabilization in demand in this end market. As we enter calendar year 2022, we expect PC unit sales to be in line with those for calendar year 2021. Mix of enterprise PCs in calendar year 2022 is projected to be higher as companies invest to support hybrid work environments. This shift in the mix of PC unit shipments should increase average PC DRAM and NAND content. Low-power DRAM has grown to 20% of the PC industry DRAM bit demand today and is projected to become the majority of the PC market in five years. Given our industry-leading solutions in low-power DRAM, we are well positioned to benefit from this trend. In FQ1, we achieved qualifications and volume production of our 176-layer Gen4 PCIe client SSD at several PC OEMs as well as our first revenues for DDR5 memory. Across the PC industry, demand for DDR5 products is significantly exceeding supply due to non-memory component shortages impacting memory suppliers' ability to build DDR5 modules. We expect these shortages to moderate through 2022, enabling bit shipments of DDR5 to grow to meaningful levels in the second half of calendar 2022. We are poised to take advantage of this transition with industry-leading DDR5 solutions for PCs. In the fast-growing graphics market, Micron holds an excellent position with a broad product portfolio featuring our proprietary GDDR6X product line and the partnerships with leading GPU suppliers. We increased our revenue sequentially and year-over-year. Our proprietary GDDR6X continues to have market success, including integration on NVIDIA's high-end gaming cards. In FQ1, we were pleased to announce availability of our GDDR6 memory solutions on AMD's Radeon RX 6000 graphics card, extending the value of GDDR6 memory to the entire gaming market. FQ1 mobile revenue increased more than 25% year-over-year. Mobile memory and storage demand continues to strengthen, supported by content-hungry applications and the continued transition from 4G to 5G, recent 5G phones, which had more than 50% higher DRAM and double the NAND content versus 4G phones. 5G smartphone sales are forecast to exceed 500 million units in calendar year '21, with 700 million units forecast for calendar year '22. We expect mobile content to continue increasing as 5G phones benefit from further innovation in 5G-enabled applications. Following several industry-first last year in FQ1, our 1-alpha-based LPDDR5X, the world's fastest mobile DRAM, was sampled and validated with MediaTek, further demonstrating Micron's leadership in the mobile market. We expect automotive and industrial to be the fastest-growing memory and storage markets over the next decade and we are exceptionally well positioned as a market share leader with over 10% of our revenue coming from these end markets. In the near term, non-memory component shortages are limiting calendar year '21 auto unit production to be flat year-over-year, significantly below end-consumer demand. However, our FQ1 year-over-year auto revenue growth remained strong at 25% as a result of content growth from in-vehicle infotainment and driver assistance applications, which are advancing rapidly, especially as EV adoption accelerates. New EVs are becoming like a data center on wheels, and we are already seeing examples of 2022 model year EVs supporting level three autonomous capability with over 140 gigabytes of DRAM and also examples with over 1 terabyte of NAND. In addition to continued content growth, we expect calendar year '22 auto unit production to increase as non-memory component shortages ease. We entered into a new supply agreement with UMC to improve our ability to support our automotive customers with NAND solutions as market demand strengthens in calendar year '22. In industrial IoT, we saw more than 80% year-over-year revenue growth, fueled by the continued ramp in applications such as factory automation and security systems. In consumer IoT, we saw more than 40% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by applications such as VR headsets and smart home devices. We expect IoT demand trends to accelerate further as 5G speeds the adoption of data-intensive applications powered by intelligent edge infrastructure. Our view of calendar 2021 and calendar 2022 industry bit demand and supply growth is largely unchanged from last quarter. We expect calendar 2021 DRAM industry bit demand growth to be in the low 20% range and industry NAND bit demand growth to be in the high 30% range. We expect calendar 2022 industry bit demand growth to be in the mid to high teens for DRAM and approximately 30% for NAND, in line with our view of the long-term bit demand growth CAGRs for each. We anticipate underlying demand in calendar 2022 to be led by increasing volume of data center server deployments, 5G mobile shipments and continued strength in automotive and industrial markets. Non-memory supply shortages have constrained customer bills and pushed out some demand across many end markets. While these shortages may cause some variability to our demand, we expect them to ease through 2022, supporting memory and storage demand growth. Turning to our bit supply expectations for the year. Given prudent industry CapEx and very lean supplier inventories, we expect a healthy industry supply-demand balance in calendar year '22. Micron's calendar year bit supply growth for DRAM and NAND will be in line with industry demand. We are planning to deliver record revenue with solid profitability in fiscal year '22, with stronger bit shipment growth in the second half of the fiscal year. The stronger second half bit shipments will be aided by the easing impact of non-memory component shortages on our supply and on customer demand, together with additional product qualifications of our 1-alpha DRAM and 176-layer NAND-based products. As expected in fiscal year '22, the continued ramps of 1-alpha DRAM and 176-layer NAND are providing us with good front-end cost reductions. As we mentioned before, our efforts to increase supply chain resilience and provide business continuity to our customers are headwinds for our assembly and packaging costs, consistent with the broader industry. Overall, we expect annual cost per bit reductions to be competitive with the industry in fiscal year '22 and over the long term. Turning to capital expenditures. We expect fiscal year '22 CapEx in the range of $11 billion to $12 billion. For both DRAM and NAND, we plan to achieve bit supply growth with no transitions alone through the middle of the decade. Beyond this time horizon, we anticipate the need to add greenfield wafer capacity for DRAM. However, for our NAND supply growth, we expect continued 3D scaling to be sufficient to meet industry demand growth without the need for wafer capacity additions. We recently announced our intent to invest more than $150 billion globally over the next decade in leading-edge memory manufacturing and R&D. As part of our commitment to investing in R&D, we announced plans to establish a state-of-the-art memory design center in Atlanta. These announcements reflect our confidence in persistent long-term demand growth for memory and storage and our ability to generate returns on these investments. We look forward to working with governments around the world, including in the U.S., as we consider sites to support future expansion. I will now turn it over to Dave.
Dave Zinsner: Thanks, Sanjay. Micron delivered outstanding results to start the fiscal year with revenue, margin and EPS all coming in within our guidance ranges while also generating healthy free cash flow. Total FQ1 revenue was approximately $7.7 billion, down 7% quarter-over-quarter and up 33% year-over-year. The sequential revenue decline was predominantly attributable to weakness related to non-memory component shortages at our customers, as Sanjay discussed earlier. FQ1 DRAM revenue was $5.6 billion, representing 73% of total revenue. DRAM revenue declined 8% quarter-over-quarter and was up 38% year-over-year. Sequentially, bit shipments declined in the mid-single-digit percentage range, while ASPs declined in the lower single-digit percentage range. FQ1 NAND revenue was approximately $1.9 billion, representing 24% of Micron's total revenue. NAND revenue declined 5% quarter-over-quarter and was up 19% year-over-year. Sequential bid shipments were approximately flat and ASPs declined in the mid-single-digit percentage range. Now turning to our FQ1 revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the Compute and Networking Business Unit was $3.4 billion, down 10% quarter-over-quarter and up 34% year-over-year. Cloud, enterprise and graphics performed well in the quarter, while client revenues declined sequentially. Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $1.9 billion, up 1% sequentially and up 27% year-over-year. Micron continues to lead in managed NAND and MCP revenue surpassed 50% of Mobile revenue in FQ1 for the fifth consecutive quarter. Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $1.2 billion, down 4% from the prior quarter and up 26% year-over-year. SBU profitability benefited in FQ1 from the strong progress made in ramping our 176-layer node. Finally, revenue for the Embedded Business Unit was $1.2 billion, the second highest in our history. EBU revenue was up 51% year-over-year and down 10% from record levels in the prior quarter. EBU gross margin and operating margin improved sequentially, driven by strong execution. The consolidated gross margin for FQ1 was 47% at the midpoint of our guidance and down approximately 85 basis points from the prior quarter. A higher mix of NAND sales was a headwind to FQ1 gross margin. Operating expenses in FQ1 were $891 million. We continue to expect FY '22 R&D to be up approximately 15% over FY '21 as we invest to strengthen our portfolio. FQ1 operating income was strong at $2.7 billion, resulting in an operating margin of 35%, down slightly from 37% in FQ4 and up from 17% in the prior year. FQ1 adjusted EBITDA was $4.4 billion, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 57%, flat from the prior quarter and up from 43% in the prior year. Non-GAAP earnings per share in FQ1 were $2.16, down from $2.42 in FQ4 and up from $0.78 in the year ago quarter. EPS included approximately $0.01 of gains from Micron Ventures investments. Turning to cash flows and capital spending. We generated $3.9 billion in cash from operations in FQ1, representing 51% of revenue. Net capital spending was $3.3 billion during the quarter. We continue to expect fiscal 2022 CapEx to be between $11 billion and $12 billion, and it will be front-end loaded in the fiscal year. Due to the strong revenue and profitability, we generated approximately $671 million in free cash flow. In addition, we received approximately $900 million from the sale of the Lehi fab, which closed in the quarter. We completed share repurchases of approximately $260 million or approximately 3.6 million shares in FQ1. Including our dividend payment, we returned around $371 million to shareholders in the quarter, which represented more than 50% of the free cash flow generated during the quarter. In addition, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.10 to be paid on January 18 to shareholders of record on January 3. We remain committed to returning more than 50% of the cross-cycle free cash flow through a combination of dividends and buybacks. As we've mentioned before, we will be opportunistic in share repurchases and more aggressive when the shares are trading at larger discounts to intrinsic value. Our ending FQ1 inventory was $4.8 billion, and average days for the quarter were 103 days within our normal target range of 95 to 105 days. We expect to exit FY '22 with days of inventory at less than 100 days as we expect our DRAM and NAND supply to be tight for the year. We ended the quarter with $11.5 billion of total cash and investments and $14 billion of total liquidity. Our FQ1 total debt was $7 billion. Following our successful sustainability-linked credit facility in May and continuing with our strong commitment to enhancing our environmental and social performance in FQ1, we achieved two important milestones for Micron: our inaugural green bond and inaugural long bonds. The total proceeds from these bonds were $2 billion, and several nationally recognized minority disabled veteran and women-owned financial institutions participated. The $1 billion green bond proceeds will finance eligible sustainability-focused projects, including reducing the Company's greenhouse gas emissions, energy and water use and waste generation. The $1 billion proceeds from the long bonds, along with cash on hand, were used to redeem Micron's senior notes maturing in 2023 and 2024. The net result from the green and long bond offering was essentially leverage-neutral for Micron, while improving our net interest expense and increasing the weighted average maturity of our notes and bank debt from four years to nine years. Now turning to our outlook for the fiscal second quarter. We're starting to see stabilization in demand for PC customers and end demand remains solid across our markets. On the margin front, we expect that mix improvements are a positive factor for gross margins in NAND. While we continue to have cost headwinds due to COVID-19 mitigation expenses and above normal assembly, test and component costs, our front-end costs continue to benefit from our ramp of 1-alpha DRAM and 176-layer NAND. We expect operating expenses to increase sequentially as we invest in next-generation technologies and products for both DRAM and NAND and accelerate our new product road map. With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for FQ2 is as follows. We expect revenue to be $7.5 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in the range of 46%, plus or minus 100 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $975 million, plus or minus $25 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 10% for FQ2. Based on a share count of approximately 1.14 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $1.95, plus or minus $0.10. Our FQ1 results and FQ2 outlook keep us on track to deliver record revenue and solid profitability and free cash flow in FY '22. In closing, our business is delivering strong cross-cycle performance, revenue growth has significantly outpaced the broader semiconductor industry, gross margins have averaged over 40% and operating margins have averaged around 30%. The strong product and technology momentum and Micron's solid execution give us confidence that we can sustain solid financial performance in the future. I'll now turn it back to Sanjay.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Dave. Micron's culture has played a significant role in driving our strong results. Our vision to transform how the world uses information to enrich life for all serves both as an inspiration for our team and is a foundation for everything we do. Earlier this month, we released Micron's 2021 DEI report entitled For All, which highlights significant accomplishments across the six DEI commitments that we introduced last year. These accomplishments include achieving comprehensive global pay equity as well as increasing representation of underrepresented groups among new college graduate hires by 7%. We also publicly disclosed consolidated equal employment opportunity or EEO-1 data for the first time. This report is available on our website. Demand for memory and storage remains strong. The broad integration of AI, proliferation of the intelligent edge, continued data center growth, EV adoption and 5G deployment are creating expanded opportunities for Micron to innovate and deliver new value to our customers. The strategic importance of semiconductors to economic growth has never been more clear and ensuring the security of supply for customers across all industries has never been more important. We look forward to working with governments and initiatives to invest in domestic production both here in the U.S. through the CHIPS Act and FABS Act and in the other countries around the world. It is a truly exciting time in the industry. Our business is robust and growing, and our team is energized to seize the opportunities ahead of us. We'll now open for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. You may proceed with your question.
C.J. Muse: I guess first question would be around more depth from you on kind of the current supply-demand environment as this cycle is really different from any other cycle. Obviously, in the last quarter, we've seen PC kitting issues. Now that appears to be largely resolved. You've talked about shortages in auto. Curious how you're thinking about kind of normal seasonality, if at all, into first half and middle part of 2022, where you're seeing ongoing tightness and how we should interpret that in terms of the sequential bit growth into the second half of fiscal '22 and beyond in calendar '22?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, C.J. So happy holidays to you, too, and to all our listeners on the call. With respect to the demand trends, we -- as we said, we see second half to be strong bit growth supported by the easing of shortages across our customer base. These shortages that our customers have experienced have constrained demand for us. And of course, their end demand trends have been strong. So as the supply chain shortages ease during the course of 2022, that will be a tailwind for demand for us, for memory and storage products. And of course, there is some aspect of seasonality, as you know, in the current quarter, particularly in some segments that are more consumer-oriented parts of our business. So second half, yes, there will be a stronger seasonality aspect as well. Then is the product cycles of our customers.  New products in data center with new processors, with new architectures that are enabled with more memory channels, more cores in those processor, more AI and big data workloads driving greater demand for memory and storage in the -- during calendar year '22. We expect calendar year '22 to be a strong year for data center demand. 5G, with respect to smartphones continues to drive strong content increases as well as, of course, more 5G phones are being sold. And automotive, we talked about some of the trends of new vehicles that will have more content. And certainly, EVs with more than 140 gigabytes of DRAM and some EVs having a terabyte of NAND content, this is the trend that's starting to build up as well. So overall, the devices have more content. And actually, in automotive, if you think about it, we have 90 million automobiles versus servers at about 15 million. So 6x of automobiles with increasing content. So of course, this will be a strong demand driver, not just for 2022. I mean, beyond that as well. So the demand trends are secular here in nature. And of course, we work closely with our customers, and we understand how they are looking at their own demand rolling out through calendar '22. So demand trends are strong. We expect healthy demand supply environment in calendar year '22. On the supply side, of course, it has been disciplined CapEx. And as we have highlighted, we expect DRAM to be in mid-teens to high teens in terms of year-over-year supply growth and NAND approximately 30%. And of course, on the supply side, the CapEx has been disciplined by the suppliers, but also equipment constraints, the long lead time that is there. That, too, gives us confidence regarding calendar year '22 supply outlook. So overall, we believe we are well positioned to deliver a strong second half based on all the demand aspects as well as supply aspects that I just described here as well as a strong profitability for record fiscal year '22 revenue and robust profitability.
C.J. Muse: That's very helpful. As a quick follow-up, Dave, can you speak to the cost side? You highlighted expectations for strong front-end cost down. Curious how are you thinking about normalization of COVID-related expenses? And how should we be thinking about any mix shifts in your product portfolio in calendar '22?
Dave Zinsner: Sure. Thanks, C.J. and happy holidays as well. Let me join Sanjay, in telling everybody happy holidays. Yes. So from a cost perspective -- let me just step back a little bit on the margin front because I think it's worth touching on it just for a second. So we delivered very strong gross margins, as you saw in the first quarter, 47%, right in line with where we thought we'd be. Just keep in mind that just a year ago, our gross margins were just a little bit over 30%. So this is a pretty significant improvement in the gross margins. And of course, some of that obviously comes from pricing, but it also comes from a good cost discipline and the beginnings of the ramp of 1-alpha and 176-layer that we saw last year and into this year. As we look into the second quarter, we do expect to continue to see a tailwind from cost reductions associated with both 176-layer and 1-alpha node, and that should continue through the year. Also, as Sanjay mentioned, we have a lot of product calls ahead of us for this year that will improve the mix of our business into high-value solutions, and so we also expect that to be beneficial. The question -- the root of your question is these costs that we're seeing in terms of COVID mitigation and some inflationary pressure. Those are likely to continue through the year. Hard to say when they abate, but we do expect that they will continue through the year. But other than that, the other areas that -- where we have good control over I think we're executing very well in terms of delivering good cost reductions. And at these levels of profitability, the ROI for us, ROIC for us from a business perspective is quite high. So, we're in a good -- what I think is a really good place.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question.
Vivek Arya: You mentioned, Sanjay that you are starting to see PC customers less constrained from a component perspective. I'm curious, is that a near term? Or is that an expectation of second half of fiscal year '22 comment? So when do you expect your shipments to PC customers as to start to improve?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, the comment is relative to what we saw three months ago. And as we had highlighted in our earnings call -- last earnings call, we have seen that certain PC customers had their supply chain challenges, making it hard for them to get all non-memory components, thereby limiting their production of PCs, even though their end demand of PCs was still strong. So yes, compared to that, what we have seen is that their inventory adjustment that was as a result of their non-component shortages, is now largely behind them, and we are certainly seeing recovery of demand on the PC front compared to the levels that existed three months ago. And overall, as I noted that for calendar year '22, we expect total PC unit sales to be similar calendar year '21 level. So PC, we expect will be recovering for us in terms of demand as we go forward here in calendar year '22.
Vivek Arya: Right. Very helpful. And for my follow-up, Sanjay, you mentioned 75% of your revenues are now based on these long-term agreements. What kind of assumptions goes into that? Are these take-or-pay arrangements? Just given the cyclical nature of the industry, how fixed or dependable are these contracts from a price or volume or margin perspective?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So again, I would like to remind you that about four years ago, five years ago, we used to have about 10% of our revenue based on these LTAs. And today, we have more than 75% of our revenue based on LTAs. What the LTAs have done is bring us closer to the customer and really enable us to have a much closer dialogue on their planning, their forecast and enables us to plan our supply and the mix of supply appropriately as well. These LTAs are nonbinding in nature, but they do help build greater visibility, greater transparency. And over the long haul, build greater trust and accountability between us and partners because value of memory is just continuing to increase. And there is sentiment of course wanting to make sure that there is sufficient supply of memory available to our customers. So we work closely with them, and it helps us decide our product portfolio as well and manage our overall product portfolio and the mix of the product. So these agreements are volume-targeted agreements. They're not generally based on pricing, but they do help us as well as our customers plan our business far better and give us greater visibility. And again, these have been worked on, improved upon over the course of last few years, and we continue to look forward to continuing to strengthen these LTAs going forward as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. You may proceed with your question.
John Pitzer: Congratulations on the solid results. Sanjay, I want to go back to your expectation for industry bit demand growth for DRAM in calendar year '22 of mid-to-high teens. While that's in line with kind of your long-term view for bit demand, it would be a relatively big deceleration from this year despite the fact that it sounds like you've got a lot of good tailwinds next year, whether it be PC mix improving, smartphone mix and units improving or new architectural shifts on the server side that are going to significantly increase DRAM density per server. And so I'm kind of curious, when you look at that expectation for next year. Is that being gated by what you and your peers can supply to the industry? Is it being gated by your view of demand? Is it being gated by components outside of your control?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So I think you're right to note that certainly, supply is limited. As I highlighted earlier, CapEx in the industry has been disciplined. And of course, as you know, that exiting 2020, there was inventory in the industry. Supplier inventories are at lean levels as well. And of course, in terms of supply growth, given the various aspects of supply chain shortages across all industries that have been discussed, equipment today has long lead time as well. So overall, when you really look at calendar year '22, overall supply is rather limited. And of course, demand trends are strong. What I would like to highlight is that you really have to look at long-term CAGR. The long-term CAGR on DRAM of mid-teens to high teens is really driving strong growth, and it is there because of all of the demand trends we have discussed. And so you can't just look at one year, you have to continue to look at longer-term trends. These are secular trends in nature, driving more demand for memory and storage. And of course, what we have provided here is our estimation regarding the bit growth, this is what we expect, and we'll continue to monitor this. Essentially, we expect a healthy industry demand supply environment in calendar year '22, particularly on the side of DRAM.
John Pitzer: That's helpful. And then, Dave...
Sanjay Mehrotra: And I think, again, it's my supply comments are based on some of the CapEx that we have ourselves said is in DRAM is guided down, but also by our other suppliers in other suppliers that have DRAM in the industry.
John Pitzer: That's helpful. And then Dave, as a quick follow-up just on the OpEx line, both this quarter and last quarter, you sort of characterized fiscal year '22 as an investment year, but you kind of came in at the low end of OpEx for the fiscal first quarter. Were there any sort of pandemic issues that are preventing you from investing at the rate you want? And as you think about the balance of the fiscal year, how do we think about linearity of OpEx? And what are the two or three big buckets of incremental spend?
Dave Zinsner: Yes. So it's right to note that there's a little bit of tightness in the labor market, which, of course, it makes it challenging. But I'd say the biggest single contributor of the OpEx this quarter -- in the first fiscal quarter was just lower R&D expenses and related to prequalification expenses. And those can be a little lumpy and sometimes you just fall over the transom between the first and second quarter of a year. And so it just turns out that they didn't hit in the first quarter, but we feel very confident that they will hit in the second quarter. And we will really spend in absolute terms for the year at the same level as we were predicting last quarter. It's more of a timing situation. So we'll have this kind of step-up in OpEx for the second fiscal quarter. And then it's a much lower sequential rate of growth in the third and fourth fiscal quarter that will get us to roughly, call it, 15% for R&D and SG&A will be a bit below that. But overall, we drive the number we're in.
Operator: Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. You may proceed with your question.
Timothy Arcuri: Dave, my first question is for you. Can you walk us through the impact from the Lehi sale? I think there were some underloading charges and there was maybe like $100 million a quarter worth of OpEx. So can you sort of bridge that for us as it relates to Lehi between the fiscal Q1 results and the fiscal Q2 guidance?
Dave Zinsner: Sure. So we had about $100 million of revenue in the first fiscal quarter related to wafer sales. It was somewhat accelerated because we closed at the end of October. That's a little bit higher than we've actually been running for the last couple of quarters. So that does actually go away in the second quarter. On the margin front, it was actually pretty close to the corporate average. We -- normally, that's lower, but we moved the assets to a held-for-sale status, I think, at the end of the second fiscal quarter of last year. And so that discontinued the depreciation expense there. And so, we saw margins generally -- relatively similar levels once you kind of factor that in. So a lot of the underloading got somewhat removed over the course of the third and fourth fiscal quarter -- or let's call it the fourth -- first fiscal quarter, such that it won't have a meaningful impact to gross margins in the second fiscal quarter.
Timothy Arcuri: Got it. And then, Sanjay, for you, just back on the topic of long-term agreements with your customers. Obviously, there's been quite a change in the tenor of sort of how you engage with them. And my question is sort of where do you see this all heading? I mean when you talk to your customers, they're very, very concerned about procuring DRAM at a reasonable price. So for example, do you envision a scenario where maybe you can get them to prepay you for bits?
Sanjay Mehrotra: As we highlighted, I mean, our discussions with our customers and LTAs are more around the requirements of supply. And of course, these lead to closer discussion in terms of understanding their product portfolio, their road map and how our road map gets defined and how our portfolio fits in with their requirements. So as I mentioned earlier, I mean, these discussions, these relationships with our customers have continued to evolve over the course of last few years, taking us from yes, that 10% LTAs to now 75% LTAs. But they're also continuing to evolve in terms of the relationship that is based on value as well. So of course, we will continue to look for opportunities, as I mentioned earlier, to strengthen these LTAs in the future as well. And I would just like to highlight that we are in this good position with the customers in terms of gaining greater visibility to their requirements and being able to drive these LTAs through a lot of good work that our team has done here. The sales teams, our business unit teams and, of course, supported by strong technology, product portfolio and supply chain execution that just gives these customers and other partners the confidence in engaging in these LTA discussions with us.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SFG. You may proceed with your question.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Sanjay, my first question is for you. I was wondering if you have any thoughts as to how you see the mix of DDR5 as a percentage of overall server DRAM trending throughout 2022? And I have a follow-up for David.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So with respect to 2022, as the new processors that are able to use DDR5 gets rolled out into the marketplace, that will drive adoption of DDR5 in the server space as well. As we noted, in the PC space, DDR5 adoption has already started, and we have begun to shape the DDR5 product. DDR5 currently is in high demand. Actually, supply there is limited for DDR5 in the industry. So when I look at PC as well as for server, we expect that DDR5 will be ramping up first in PC. And as the processors, with DDR5 new processors become available in the industry. We particularly see that ramping up later in calendar year '22. I expect that we will be exiting calendar year '22 with approximately 20% the mix of DDR -- I'm sorry, with approximately 20% of the mix of DRAM in compute space, at approximately 20% there, okay?
Mehdi Hosseini: Got it.
Sanjay Mehrotra: And so, a stronger ramp in the second half versus the first half because, again, as those new processors ramp up into production with our customers, that will drive a ramp of DDR5 in the second half in the server space. And in PC, as I mentioned, it's happening well throughout calendar year '22.
Mehdi Hosseini: Got it. And for David, I'm just trying to better understand the supply-demand environment. And when I look at your guide -- revenue guide and what you reported for DRAM and NAND ASP, seems to me the underlying assumption is based on moderate decline in blended prices. And I'm not asking you for a guide, but is that a fair observation?
Dave Zinsner: For second fiscal quarter, you're talking, Mehdi?
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes.
Dave Zinsner: Yes. So obviously, we can't comment on pricing on a forward-looking basis. I would just reiterate Sanjay's comments that we see a healthy supply/demand dynamic for the fiscal year for both DRAM and NAND, and we continue to ramp 176-layer and 1-alpha, which gives us a good cost structure going forward. We're going to continue to drive the mix. All of those assumptions are built into our margin guidance. Of course, there's a high and a low to that margin assumption based on how things can play out.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question.
Joe Moore: I wonder if you could talk about the role of sort of just in case philosophy that you talked about a couple of quarters ago. Clearly, you're comfortable with your customer inventory levels now. But how are they feeling? And do you expect there to be a higher level of inventory on a sustained basis from here?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So inventory strategy is clearly vary from customers to customers. And some definitely, given what pandemic introduced in terms of supply chain shortages, are looking at strategically higher level of inventory. Some may also be doing it for geopolitical considerations. So we don't really yet see customers going back to pre-pandemic levels, but the strategy around inventory does vary from customer to customer. And overall, as I said, for -- on an industry-wide level, while there may be some pockets of some customers carrying extra inventory overall, given the current environment, customer inventory levels are in a decent shape. And just look at us, Micron itself is also, in our own manufacturing, we are holding a lot more inventory of raw materials just to make sure that our supply chain has assuredness with respect to our ability to supply our customers. And our operations planning just in the current environment of somewhat higher uncertainty on the geopolitical front as well as pandemic-related front is operating with greater levels of inventory -- with non-memory components inventory. And similarly, customers have similar approach as well in terms of managing their inventory.
Operator: Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.
Toshiya Hari: I guess my first one is on the supply side. Sanjay, you talked about constraints in the equipment space a couple of times. Are you actually seeing delays or sort of decommits from your suppliers at all? I guess you've maintained your full year CapEx guidance, so perhaps not, but I just wanted to clarify that. And then my part two of my supply question, were there any -- was there any impact from the earthquake in Taiwan in the quarter, whether it be from a bit perspective or in terms of your ability to reduce costs?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So our procurement team and our supply chain team works closely with equipment suppliers in terms of long-term planning and securing of slots for equipment. And we continue to drive that. And yes, we have, of course, seen lengthening lead times, but those have also been factored in, in terms of our overall planning. And as I mentioned, I mean, we are really seeing a lot more collaboration with these suppliers in terms of driving our own demand -- timing of equipment. So, no, I would not say that we have seen any push outs versus our own expectations. But again, those expectations of equipment delivery are built based on our collaboration with the suppliers and with the visibility that we have provided and with a lot of good planning work between us and our suppliers. And your second part of your question, I forgot now, what was the second part of the question? Can you please repeat that?
Toshiya Hari: Earthquake in Taiwan, any impact to bid shipments in the quarter or cost downs?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So the earthquake in Taiwan, at the time of the earthquake, certainly did reduce some of our bid production. By end of the quarter, our impact to our overall output was meaningfully reduced.
Toshiya Hari: Got it. And then as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about your business in automotive and industrial. You talked about the two businesses or the two end markets combining for more than 10% of your overall revenue. In a fairly normal environment, whatever that is, both in automotive and industrial, how are you thinking about the sustainable growth rate in those two end markets? You threw out a couple of growth rate numbers for the quarter, but curious how you're thinking about both auto and industrial on a cross-cycle basis?
Sanjay Mehrotra: The auto and industrial certainly will be high-growth drivers for us across the cycle. I spoke to all the demand drivers in the automotive market. Micron is clearly an automotive leader in this space. And we said that auto and industrial combined, over 10%. If you look at automotive itself, our share of the market is somewhere mid-single digits. And this year, we would expect to continue to grow based on all our experience in this market, our share leadership, the high quality we provide and increasing demand for memory and storage content in these markets. And of course, industrial is also growing for us with 5G enabling tremendous demand in the industrial segment with industrial IoT, market drones with surveillance, equipment, with automation in the factories. All of this is tending to drive greater demand as well. So we expect solid growth in both of these markets. We expect the -- overall, if you look at DRAM content CAGR in the automotive market, that's approximately 40% over the course of next three years, NAND CAGR in the automotive power kit, above 50% as well over the course of next three years. So, this really has legs in terms of sustainable growth. And again, we are well positioned in these markets, and we expect our percentage of revenue in this market to continue to increase over the course of next several years.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shannon Cross of Cross Research. You may proceed with your question.
Shannon Cross: I have one and then a follow-up. I realize it's early in what's going on with regard to the current variants. But I'm wondering if you've seen any impact from it? And also given here as the first company, at least that I cover that has had to provide guidance in light of some of the changes. I'm curious how you approach thinking about the variant? And then I have a follow-up.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So first of all, with respect to our focus on the business, with respect to our people and Micron has been proactive all throughout the pandemic in taking actions to protect the safety of our team members, whether it is managing strict protocols with our operations -- on-site operations with respect to masking, physical distancing as well as vaccination. And of course, as a result of that, we have been successful in continuing to run our operations all throughout the pandemic. And despite various industry-wide challenges on supply, we have been overall generally quite good in terms of our ability to support our customers. With respect to the Micron, of course, we will continue our stringent focus on safety of our team members as well as continuing to run our operations. We will not let our guard down in this regard and of course, continue to monitor all the trends and developments here. I would like to point out that even with Delta, all our operations continued to run well. And of course, as you saw, the demand for our products continued to be strong as well. And of course, we saw in some parts of the business, higher demand as a result of COVID for certain periods of time, whereas other parts may have had lower demand for certain periods of time as well. So of course, we will continue to monitor the trend. And to the extent that Omicron has any impact on the macroeconomic environment, of course, that might impact some of our business. However, you have seen that we have been extremely adaptive. We have been extremely agile, and we will continue to do so.
Shannon Cross: Okay. And then I'm just curious, you mentioned higher OpEx, obviously, in fiscal 2022. And that would be accelerating the road map. I'm wondering if you can elaborate a little bit on what we can expect, and is that more sort of a 2023 comment in terms of road map benefit?
Dave Zinsner: Well, you're already seeing a lot of the benefit. We'll have a lot of good products coming out through 2022, which were the benefit of the investments that we made in prior years. It's -- to a large extent, it's a continuation of the progression of our products in all markets. Obviously, there's more that we have to do in the SSD front to fully capture all of the opportunity from an NVMe perspective. So there's going to be investment there. There's obviously the next set of process technologies, which will include continued investment in EUV for the 1-gamma that Sanjay mentioned. So lots of different products that we think will be necessary to address the whole market plus continued investment on the process technology side to keep our pace in terms of a leadership position and cost leadership position.
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes our Q&A session. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Farhan. Good afternoon, everyone. We delivered outstanding results in Fiscal Q4, achieving robust profitability and the second-highest quarterly revenue in Micron's history. Strong execution drove healthy results across segments, including record quarterly revenue in NAND, as well as in our embedded business. Fiscal 2021 was a year of many records for Micron.  We achieved our highest ever mobile revenue driven by all-time high managed NAND revenue and MCP mix. Our embedded business had a tremendous record-breaking year, with auto and industrial businesses both had substantial new highs. Another crucial advantage is consumer business and overall QLC mix and NAND, all hit records in fiscal 2021.  Through the year, we successfully navigated multiple obstacles brought on by the pandemic and reached several key milestones. For the first time in Micron's history, we established technology leadership concurrently in both DRAM and NAND. Micron's 1-alpha DRAM and 176-layer NAND are the industry's most advanced nodes in high-volume production.  And we further strengthened our product leadership by becoming the first to introduce LP5x DRAM and uMCP5 managed NAND in mobile and the industry's first functional safety capable LP5 for automotive applications.  The secular demand for memory and storage, combined with Micron's focused execution and have a rock-solid balance sheet, position us well to deliver strong financial performance and create significant shareholder value in fiscal 2022 and beyond. Demonstrating our confidence in our business trajectory, we initiated a quarterly dividend that we aim to grow over time.  Memory is at the leading edge of semiconductor manufacturing, and Micron has leadership in both DRAM and NAND technology. This quarter released maturities in our ramp of 1-Alpha DRAM, 176-layer NAND, 20% to 30% faster than prior nodes, and delivered performance and featured improvements, that will help unleash customer innovation.  We believe we are several quarters ahead of the industry in the deployment of these process technologies. Additionally, through deeper customer collaboration, we have further accelerated the time-to-market for value-added solutions built using these nodes.  1-Alpha and 1-DRAM nodes combined now represent the majority of our DRAM bit production, driven by strong growth of 1-Alpha production. And by the end of the calendar year or 176-layer NAND will make up the majority of our NAND bit production. Looking beyond 1-Alpha DRAM and 176-layer NAND, we are investing to sustain scaling in both technologies for the next decade.  Adding momentum to our years of R&D and EUV, we recently took delivery of the industry's latest E UV system, NXE 3600 at our Boise headquarters, where we operate one of the world's most advanced centers for semiconductor research and development.  The delivery of this tool is an important milestone towards our previously disclosed plan of implementing EUV in high-volume manufacturing, in the 2024-time frame. We expect that the integration of EUV with our existing multi-patterning immersion lithography expertise will help us maintain DRAM technology leadership for many years to come.  In addition to being the technology leader and an innovation partner, we are uniquely positioned as a strategic supplier to our customers. Micron is the only U.S.-based memory Company, and our strong global manufacturing network provides us with a diversified source of supply, which has become increasingly critical to ensure that we continue to deliver products reliably to our customers.  The advantages of this unique position have been proven throughout the past 18 months, as we have successfully navigated the challenges of COVID-19 across our global manufacturing network while maintaining continuity of supply to our customers.  Now let us review our end markets. The demand for memory and storage has evolved dramatically from the PC - centric era. Today, demand for memory and storage is driven by diversified end markets that extend from the data center to the intelligent edge, and to a growing diversity of user devices.  As a result of growing memory and storage containers for devices DRAM and NAND now account for an ever-increasing portion of the bill applications for our customers. DRAM and NAND stem share of the semiconductor industry has steadily grown over the last two decades, from around 10% to approximately 30% today.  The AI and 5G revolution are only in their infancy. And as these secular growth drivers gain further traction, we expect new data-intensive applications to continue to fuel significant increases in DRAM and NAND stem. In the fiscal Fourth Quarter, data center revenue grew sequentially and year-over-year, fueled by secular drivers in cloud demand and the resurgence of enterprise IT investment linked to improving economic growth.  The data center has become the largest market for memory and storage, driven by the rapid growth in the cloud. With our broadening portfolio of differentiated products across memory and storage, we are in a strong position to drive strong growth and profitability in this important segment.  We have been engaged on DDR5 from initial specification development, and are very pleased to support customer transitions to DDR5-enabled platforms starting later this calendar year. We're also enhancing our NVMe SSD portfolio and we'll soon introduce PCIe Gen four datacenter SSDs with Micron-designed controllers and leveraging the full benefit of vertical integration.  These SSDs will strengthen our market position over the course of the coming quarters and years in the fast-growing data center, NVMe storage market. Work and learn from anywhere trends are driving the second consecutive year of double-digit PC unit sales growth in calendar 2021.  In the fiscal fourth quarter, PC DRAM revenue was up significantly year-over-year. We're making strong progress transitioning our PC DRAM to our 1-alpha node, which represented a meaningful portion of our FQ4 PC big shipments. Client QLC SSD bit mix hit a new effort and made up the majority of our client SSD bit shipments in FQ4. Our QLC leadership enhances our bit supply capability and product profitability.  We also have continued momentum ramping 176-layer NAND products for the PC markets, and we qualified our 176-layer NAND-based Gen 4 NVMe client SSDs with several PC OEMs during the quarter. In graphics, revenue increased sequentially and year-over-year, driven by a continuation of last quarter's strong next-generation game console and graphics card shipments.  Micron holds an excellent position in the fast-growing graphics market with a broad product portfolio featuring our proprietary GDR 6X product line, and deep partnerships with leading GPU suppliers. FQ4 mobile revenue increased more than 25% year-over-year, driven by continued unit sales and content growth. We expect overall smartphone unit sales to grow this year, with sales up over 500 million 5G mobile phones forecasted.  These contents 5G phones featured more than 50% higher DRAM and doubled the NAND content than 4G phones. We expect 5G and AI to drive new innovation in applications such as AI optimized video capture and editing, that will fuel DRAM and NAND content growth for years to come.  Our 1-alpha LP4 16 - gigabit design is now fully qualified and ramping at multiple OEMs. While our 176-layer NAND achieved its first UFS 3.1 qualifications at two OEMs. These wins demonstrate Micron's leadership in the mobile market and our continued strength in managed NAND products where MCP sales surpassed $1 billion for the third straight quarter.  We are continuing to see strong demand in our edge markets, which includes automotive and industrial IOT. We expect our automotive and industrial markets to be the fastest-growing memory and storage markets over the next decade. As the number one player in these markets, Micron is exceptionally well-positioned to benefit from these secular growth trends.  Other automotive businesses delivered a fourth consecutive record quarter, driven by continued recovery in auto manufacturing and the growth of memory and storage content driven by in-vehicle-infotainment and driver assistance applications.  Industrial IOT revenues also set records in the Fiscal Fourth Quarter, benefiting from the continued growth of applications, such as point-of-sale devices, factory automation, and surveillance. We expect industrial demand trends to accelerate further, at 5G speeds, that adoption of data-intensive applications powered by Intelligent Edge infrastructure.  We're also seeing an acceleration in other consumer IOT businesses driven by rapid growth in device sales such as VR headsets, smart exercise equipment, and smart speakers. Turning to market outlook calendar 2021 is shaping up to be a strong year. We expect calendar 2021 industry DRAM, bit demand growth to be in the low 20% range.  And industry NAND width demand growth to be in the high 30% range. Overall, our preliminary view is that calendar 2022 industry width demand growth will be consistent with long-term industry bit demand growth categories. In the mid to high teens for DRAM, and approximately 30% for NAND.  We anticipate underlying demand in calendar 2022 to be led by increasing datacenters, server deployments, 5G mobile shipments, and continued strength in automotive and industrial markets. Additionally, non-memory supply shortages that are constraining customer bills across various end market segments and that are pushing out some demand should ease throughout 2022 supporting demand growth during the year.  Given prudent industry CapEx and very lean supplier inventories, we expect healthy industry supply-demand balance and robust profitability for both DRAM and NAND in the year. In the near term, our FQ1 big shipments will decline modestly in both DRAM and NAND from very strong levels in FQ4.  Some PC customers are adjusting their memory and storage purchases due to shortages of non-memory components that are needed to complete PC bills. We expect this adjustment for our PC customers to be largely resolved in the coming months. We're also seeing constraints within our supply chain for certain IC components, which will some work limit our big shipments in the near term.  Big shipping growth will resume in the second half of the fiscal year, and we're planning to deliver record revenue with solid profitability in fiscal 2022. Our calendar year '22, big shipment growth for DRAM and NAND will be in line with the industry.  However, due to the strong shipments in fiscal year '21, and our below normal current inventory level, for fiscal year '22 our big shipment growth for DRAM and NAND will somewhat lag the long-term CAGR. In fiscal year '22, the continued ramp of 1-alpha and 176-layer NAND should provide us with good front-end cost reductions.  Our efforts to increase supply chain resilience and provide business continuity to our customers will cause headwinds to our assembly and packaging costs, consistent with the trend in the overall industry. Overall, we expect the annual cost-per-bit reductions to be competitive with the industry in fiscal year '22 and over the long term.  Turning to capital expenditures, we expect fiscal year '22 CapEx in the range of $11 billion to $12 billion. The year-on-year increase in CapEx is driven by our continued 176-layer NAND transition pilot line enablement for next-generation NAND and DRAM and continued infrastructure and prepayments to support the introduction of EUV.  Fiscal year '22 DRAM equipment CapEx for manufacturing will decline from fiscal year '21 as we benefit from the capital efficiency of our mature 1-alpha node. For fiscal year '22, our big supply growth will be achieved through node transitions alone, as we are a few years away from needing wafer start additions to keep up with the industry demand.  We also expect to increase fiscal year '22 R&D investment by approximately 15% from fiscal year '21 to deliver bold product and technology innovations designed to fuel the data economy, as well as to expand our portfolio to capitalize on opportunities such as high bandwidth memory and CXL solutions.  Our leadership portfolio, [Indiscernible] quality, supply chain agility, and deep customer relationships make us a preferred partner in many of our markets. And we are confident in our ability to continue to create long-term, sustained profitability, and returns built on that leadership. I will now turn it over to Dave.
Dave Zinsner: Thank you, Sanjay. Micron delivered excellent FQ4 results, highlighted by our second highest quarterly revenues, strong gross and operating margins, and our substantial positive free cash flow. Total FQ4 revenue was approximately $8.3 billion, up 11% quarter-over-quarter, and up 37% year-over-year. As a reminder, FQ4 last year was a 14-week quarter and impacts our year-over-year comparisons. FQ4 revenue growth was broad-based with solid demand and price increases in both DRAM and NAND.  Our robust growth in FQ4 contributed to strong performance in FY-21, with revenue of $27.7 billion which was up 29% from the prior fiscal year. That Q4 DRAM revenue was $6.1 billion, representing 74% of total revenue. DRAM revenue increased 12% sequentially and was up 39% year-over-year.  Bit shipments increased in the low-single-digit percentage sequentially, and ASP s increased in the high-single-digit percent range, quarter-to-quarter. For the fiscal year, DRAM revenue increased 38% year-over-year to $20 billion, representing 72% of total fiscal year revenue.  FQ4 NAND revenue was approximately $2 billion, an all-time high, and representing 24% of the total revenue. NAND revenue increased 9% sequentially and was up 29% year-over-year. its shipments increased by low-single-digit percentage sequentially, while ASP s increased in the mid-single-digit percent range, quarter-over-quarter.  For the fiscal year, we achieved a new Company record for NAND revenue of $7 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year. NAND revenue represented 25% of our total fiscal year revenue. Now, turning to our FQ4 revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the compute and networking business unit was $3.8 billion up 15% sequentially, and up 26% year-over-year.  Growth was led by the data center and graphics markets. Revenue for the mobile business unit was $1.9 billion down 5% sequentially, and up 29% year-over-year. Mobile demand remained healthy in the quarter with continued momentum from the rollout of 5G. NBU revenue for fiscal '21 exceeded $7 billion and set a new record.  Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $1.2 billion, up 19% from the prior quarter, and up 32% year-over-year. Datacenter SSDs had strong growth in the quarter driven by enterprise and cloud strength. QFC shipments set a new record in the fiscal year in terms of the percentage of our NAND shipments.  Finally, the embedded business unit generated record revenue of $1.4 billion, which was up 23% sequentially. And more than doubled year-over-year. We continued to experience strong demand across the automotive and industrial markets.  For the fiscal year, EVU revenue easily exceeded $4 billion, setting a new revenue record. The consolidated gross margin for FQ4 was 47.9% up 500 basis points from the prior quarter. Pricing increases across DRAM and NAND, as well as strong execution in our ongoing product portfolio transformation, drove margin expansion in the quarter.  Operating expenses in FQ4 were $891 million on the lower end of the range we provided in last quarter's earnings call. F Q4 operating income was $3.1 billion, resulting in an operating margin of 37% up from 32% in F Q3, and up from 21% in the prior year.  FQ4 EBITDA was $4.7 billion, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 57.1% compared to 53.3% in the prior quarter, and 47.4% in the prior year. For the fiscal year, total EBITDA was $14 billion up from $9 billion in the prior fiscal year and represented 50.4% of revenues. Non-GAAP earnings-per-share in FQ4 were $2.42, up from $1.88 in FQ3, and up from $1.08 in the year-ago quarter.  EPS included approximately $0.02 of gains from investments in our venture arm, Micron Ventures. For the fiscal year, total EPS was $6.06, up more than 100% from the $2.83 achieved in the prior fiscal year.  Turning to cash flows and capital spending, we generated $3.9 billion in cash from operations in FQ4, representing 47% of revenue. For the fiscal year, cash from operations totaled $12.5 billion, up from $8.3 billion in the prior fiscal year. Net capital spending was $2 billion during the quarter and $9.7 billion in fiscal '21.  We generated a positive free cash flow of $1.9 billion in FQ4 and over $2.8 billion for the fiscal year. The increased cash flow was driven by strong revenue growth, increased profitability, and efficient work in capital management. As Sanjay mentioned, we expect our fiscal '22 capital spending to be between $11 billion and $12 billion.  Like fiscal '21, we expect our capital spending to be weighted more to the first half of the fiscal year, which will constrain free cash flow in FQ1 and FQ2. We do expect to generate healthy free cash flow in fiscal '22, but weighted towards the back half of the year.  We also expect to close our Lehi Fab sale within FQ1, and we will receive approximately $900 million in proceeds from the sale. We completed share repurchases of $1.1 billion or approximately 13.9 million shares in FQ4. For the fiscal year, we repurchased $1.2 billion, or approximately 15.6 million shares.  From Fiscal '17 to Fiscal '21, we generated over $20 billion of free cash flow. During this period, we used approximately $5 billion of that cash flow to retire debt, and $7 billion towards buying back stock and eliminating the dilution from convertible debt, reducing our share count by 148 million shares. We also improved our total cash and investment position by $5.5 billion.  We expect that we will continue to generate strong free cash flow in the future. And as we discussed on our capital return strategy call in early August, we are committed to returning more than 50% of cross-cycle free cash flow to shareholders, through a combination of buybacks and a quarterly dividend that we expect we can grow over time.  But first dividend payment of $0.10 per share will be paid on October 18th to shareholders of record as of October 1st. The initiation of a dividend is an important milestone that reflects the structural transformation, Micron has undergone over the last several years and it shows our confidence in the sustainability of our cash flow generation.  Our ending of Q4 inventory was $4.5 billion, and the average days of the quarter were 94 days, below our normal range of 95 to 105 days. FQ4 finished goods, dollar inventory ended at the lowest levels since the [Indiscernible] acquisition in 2013. We ended the fiscal year with $10.5 billion of total cash and investments and $13 billion of total liquidity.  Our FQ4 total debt was $6.8 billion. Now turning to our outlook. In demand across our major markets remain strong. As Sanjay mentioned, our bit shipments are expected to decline modestly in FQ1, as we normalize our inventory position and work with PC customers as they manage through their supply chain challenges.  And on the gross margin side, our outlook is similar to how we viewed FQ4. While we will benefit from our no transitions on both DRAM and NAND, we will continue to see near-term headwinds from COVID-related expenses in assembly and packaging. As a result, we expect the gross margin in FQ1 to be largely a function of the mix. With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for FQ1 is as follows.  We expect revenue to be $7.65 billion-plus or minus $200 million, gross margins to be in the range of 47%, plus or minus 100 basis points, and our operating expenses to be approximately $915 million, plus or minus $25 million. Excluding the impact of any potential new tax legislation, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 10% for FQ1.  Based on a share count of approximately 1.14 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $2.10, plus or minus $0.10. In closing, fiscal 2021 was a year of considerable growth and success for Micron. Looking at four-year average metrics reveals the sustained cross-cycle performance of our business. Over the last four years, our gross margins have exceeded 40% and our operating cash flow margins have been approximately 50%.  Despite the challenges stemming from the ongoing pandemic, we have continued to generate significant positive free cash flow while making substantial investments to grow our business. Our technology, product, and financial position provide strong momentum as we enter the new fiscal year. I'll now turn it back to Sanjay.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Dave. I would like to share the recent accomplishments that make me especially proud of our Company. Our strong Micron culture has played a significant role in driving our results aligned to our broader vision to transform how the world uses the information to enrich life for all.  Our Company culture, community leadership, and business performance have been recognized globally, earning multiple industry awards and recognitions this year. This month, we were ranked by Fortune as one of the top 20 best places to work in manufacturing and production.  The only semiconductor Company to earn this recognition. Fiscal '21 was an excellent year for Micron. As our fourth-quarter results clearly demonstrate, we are delivering strong financial results. We are planning to deliver record revenues and solid profitability in fiscal year '22.  Demand for memory and storage is solid across market segments. Industry trends like the broad integration of artificial intelligence into all computing, proliferation of the Intelligent Edge, continued data center growth, and deployments of 5G networks create new and expanding opportunities for Micron.  The importance of semiconductors to these markets is underscored by government initiatives to invest in domestic semiconductor production, both here in the U.S. through the chipset and in other countries around the world.  We're focused on building our technology leadership to deliver broad new solutions, that offer unique value to our customers. Our business is robust and we are energized to seize the opportunities ahead of us, as a truly exciting time in the semiconductor industry. We will now be open to questions.
Farhan Ahmad: Operator can you please open the line for questions?
Operator: At this time, [Operator Instructions] we have your first question from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan, your line is open.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. There are a lot of concerns on inventories in all of your end markets, especially PCs, just given the non-memory component shortages that are limiting notebook and desktop shipments in the second half of the year.  Can you guys just qualitatively describe customer and channel inventories in the PC, server, and smartphones segments of your business? And also, as you normalize your inventories through the first half of this fiscal year, do you guys anticipate a normal level of inventories on your Balance Sheet as you entered the second half of the fiscal year?
Sanjay Mehrotra: I will have Dave comment on the second part of your question, and on the overall inventory question, I would say that by and large, inventory among our customers is in decent shape. Of course, we talked about the PC market, where due to semi-conductor component shortages, our PC customers, some of them are not able to fulfill all of their end demand, and therefore they have made some adjustments in their purchases, impacting some of our demand in the near-term into the PC market.  And we think this is short-lived, and over the course of the next few months, this will work itself out. And on the smartphone side, of course, you know that new full-cycle, new full launches are coming up, and this tends to be a seasonally strong quarter for new smartphone shipments as well.  While some customers may because of geopolitical considerations or through the lessons learned during the pandemic, or their own supply chain considerations of supply chain shortages, maybe having a strategy of carrying more inventory than some other customers. Overall, the smartphone market continues to be driven by 5G transition smartphones over the course of calendar year '22 with 5G increasing by 50% from the 2021 levels.  And on the data center side, of course, the investment cycle is strong on the data center side, and of course, the pandemic has driven strong acceleration in digital transformation, and that certainty extending into the cloud, cloud services, video streaming, e-commerce, all of these trends, along with new architectures, new processors that are being introduced that actually enable greater AI capability into the workloads and greater usage of data attach of memory in the servers.  All of these also are creating new demand, so overall data center inventory levels are also in decent shape. So, what -- inventory in our markets today is in much better shape than it was back in the 2018-time frame.  Again, some customers may have higher levels due to their strategic considerations and they may choose to continue to do so in the longer term as well. Given the challenges faced by the supply chains during the pandemic, as well as given geopolitical considerations. This is what I would like to share with you on inventory and Dave; you can add a second part of the question.
Dave Zinsner: So just as a reminder, we look at our optimal level of inventory, we like to see it be 100 plus in terms of days, we can operate slightly below that. We're definitely below the optimal level, it's at 94 days. I'd say the -- for us we never like to see it go is below 95 days.  And so, we think we will make a little bit of improvement next quarter on -- in terms of days, it will probably be up a few days. But I think it's going to be still below that 100-day figure. As we look through the year its -- assuming we can make some progress on inventory. We think we can get it more into, what we would call the optimal stage, which is 100 to 105 days of inventory.  Probably going to exit the year somewhere in the 100 days of inventory. As we already talked about, finished goods inventory is really where we're particularly lean. And we do have to make some progress in that space to get ourselves into a better position. But overall, I would say the back half of the year will probably be in the optimal range.
Harlan Sur: Thank you for the insights, Daron. And you mentioned in your prepared remarks, seeing constraints within your supply chain for certain IC components, which is going to limit some of your bit shipments also here in the near term. Can you just give us some examples of some of these IC components both in DRAM and NAND? I assume, for example, you have some NAND controller constraints, but what about in DRAM?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, the Harlan -- you are right to note that some of the controller shortages are there with respect to FSD, and particularly impacting the data center FSD. We also have certain shortages of analog, ICs. And these shortages are impacting our ability to ship to the full demand level that we are seeing from the customers.  And if you look at controllers, some of the analog ICs as well as in general, the overall supply chain is running tight. And we have done a great job by our supply chain team in addressing these needs in the past and they continue to work on securing the supply for the future. And we would expect that over time, this will get better.
Harlan Sur: Thank you, Sanjay.
Latif Masud: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Evercore. Your question, please?
C.J. Muse: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping to drill into your gross margin. Pretty impressive despite the topline guide. So, I guess a couple of parts here. First, in terms of the costs down within the November quarter, I'm assuming more DRAM than NAND.  Can you speak to that? Can you also speak to mix shifts in the quarter? And then, for all of fiscal '22, how should we be thinking about the type of cost downs across both DRAM and NAND? Should we think 10 plus percent is sustainable year-over-year for DRAM and similar type number, if not higher, on NAND, or how should we think about that? Thank you.
Dave Zinsner: Okay. Let me start with the near-term outlook. I would say the cost declines for the November quarter are going to be pretty minimal. We obviously are getting a benefit from both our 1-alpha node and our 176-layer node in NAND. But we are running into some cost headwinds as it relates to the back end mostly a function of the pandemic and the disruptions that are caused to the supply chain and so forth.  And actually, both NAND and DRAM comment quite honestly. So, no specific direction either way on DRAM and NAND. As it relates to mixing, we have a range, it can go a couple of different ways obviously. But there could be a little bit of a mix shift between DRAM and NAND that could impact where the gross margins end up.  Also, by business unit, we could see some mix shifts within the business units, which could impact our margins as well even down to the product level. So, it's hard to call within a couple of 100 basis points, so that's why we gave this range, as I've mentioned, in the prepared remarks. It's pretty similar to the range we gave back as the same that we gave in the prior quarter.  So, we're roughly seeing things pretty similar to what we saw in the fourth fiscal quarter. And I agree with you, these are great gross margins, we're pretty happy with them. The operating margins that this generates are in the mid-to-high 30s, we're expecting something similar for the First Fiscal Quarter.  So, I think we're executing very well on the profitability side of the business. In fiscal '22, we do expect really good cost declines on the front-end side for both DRAM and NAND. Again, a function of 1-alpha in DRAM and 176-layer in NAND. When we look at kind of longer-term cost declines for DRAM, we see them as being with the high-single-digit percent cost declines for the industry.  We think from a front-end perspective for DRAM, we'll do better than that next year. On the NAND front, we see cost declines over time being more in the mid-teens and we think the 176-layer next year will drive cost declines in that range next year as well.  Obviously, 21, 22 will likely have these cost headwinds as it relates to the pandemic and the supply challenges, so those things might impact us in the first couple of quarters, but hopefully, over time, that starts to go away and we'll start to see the benefit also on the back-end.  We've made a lot of investment on the back-end to improve our cost structure and I think once we get behind this or get this behind us, I should say, as it relates to the pandemic, we'll start to experience a lot of the cost benefits that we've put in place on the back end as well. I'd also note that when we look at our cost structure today, and as we're looking into next year, all the way through the year, we think the cost reductions that we're seeing are very competitive with the industry.  And the cost headwinds we're seeing are very similar to the cost headwinds that others within the industry, not only in memory but also across the entire semi-conductor space are seeing. So, we think this sets us up for, as Sanjay mentioned, very good profitability for next year. And I think that pretty much covers it.
C.J. Muse: Thank you.
Latif Masud: Thank you. Our next question comes from Shannon Cross of Cross Research. Your line is open.
Shannon Cross: Thank you very much. The first question I have is with regard to pricing. Can you talk about some of the pricing dynamics, especially with the pullback in demand from the PC vendors? Are you expecting to see any more aggressive moves from your competitors? Although given your comments on gross margin, I'm guessing the answer, maybe no.  And then my second question is, just with regard to your PC OEM partners, how are you tracking confidence that they're going to actually see the demand come through in the second half of the year. Because I get a lot of questions from people about double ordering, even just from their end customers. So, I'm just wondering if you've changed any methodology in how you're tracking what your partners are seeing or how you're providing guidance as you lookout. Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: With respect to pricing, we do not provide comments on pricing, but you look at our FQ4 of those and of course, we reported that both for DRAM and NAND in FQ4, pricing increased. And you are right to note that our gross margin guidance for FQ1 is strong. In fact, same, as Dave earlier pointed out, as our FQ4 guidance was at the time of our June call.  And as you look at not only just FQ1 for fiscal year '22, we're projecting a record year for the Company, with solid profitability for the full year as well. And just remember the pricing is always a function of the mix overall as well.  And with respect to your questions around PC, again, as I mentioned, the PC customers have been impacted by their own semiconductor shortages and their supply chain constraints. Their end demand -- their end-user demand is very strong. In fact, they have an unfulfilled backlog. Generally, among these customers, which is quite extensive.  And you know that even in the PC industry, while prices have gone up if the customers are able to maintain a strong backlog that speaks to the end strong demand. It really is all driven by work from home, learn from home, that demand acceleration that has taken place through the pandemic will continue to support a healthy environment for PC in calendar year '22 as well.  Of course, in 2020 and 2021, PC has gone through a double-digit unit growth on a calendar year basis. We expect that to moderate in calendar year '22 to perhaps from flat to low-single-digit year-over-year growth in terms of PC units sold, yet it will be a healthy market.  Again, driven by the trends, such as the economy's opening, businesses opening, workers coming back, that drives a greater mix of enterprise PCs, commercial PCs. While some of the consumer PC, such as Chromebox, maybe -- compared to last year, maybe less than demand today. But the commercial PC demand is getting stronger as well.  So overall basically -- continues to be a healthy market and we work closely with our customers and today they are really constrained by their supply chain shortages. And that's what is adjusting their purchases. And as I've said before, we believe this is going to be short-lived.  And we look forward to continuing to support our customers with our products. And as we highlighted, our new technologies, new products, [Indiscernible] for transitions, PC customers are qualifying them fast and we are focused on delivering those in calendar year '22, as well as fiscal year '22-time frame.
Shannon Cross: Thank you.
Latif Masud: Thank you. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Toshiya Hari: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more context around your fiscal '22 CapEx guidance of 11 billion to 12 billion. If you can speak to WFE within that number for fiscal '22 and then differentiate between DRAM and NAND that would be super helpful. And then just to remind us what bit supply growth are you expecting purely from transitions in both DRAM and NAND as you think about calendar '22? Thank you.
Dave Zinsner:  [Indiscernible] I'll go through the CapEx for you. So as Sanjay mentioned, and as I reiterated, we expect CapEx to be in the 11 to $12 billion range. We were roughly a little bit less than 10 billion, $9.7 billion in fiscal '21. If you look at it by the element of CapEx, we are going to invest more in pilot enablement this year.  Last year was a relatively low year for us in terms of pilot enablement. So that's going to be a reasonable step-up in our CapEx spending. We feel CapEx equipment in DRAM will be down year-over-year. We think we've made a good investment in fiscal '21 and we don't need to invest as much in fiscal '22, so that will be down.  NAND will actually step up pretty meaningfully in fiscal '22 versus '21, if you remember, we took CapEx, way down in fiscal '20, boost it up a little bit in 21. Now we're up to kind of a full investment level in '22 to support 176-layer. And that was caused because of this transition from floating gate to replacement gate when we made a pause in terms of our CapEx investment to get the first line out at relatively minimal levels.  Back-end, we should be up a bit in back-end spend as we make -- continue to make investments on the back-end to put that cost structure into better places I intimated before. We've been making investments to improve our cost structure there. The cleanroom will be down a little modestly.  And, of course, we have EUV spending that also will impact our CapEx in fiscal '22 as well. One other thing just to remind you, so we will be 60% of our CapEx weighted to the first half, probably 40% to the second half. So, this was similar to what we saw in fiscal '21. We're likely to see in fiscal '22, which is our -- haven't --is been our typical pattern over the last couple of years.
Toshiya Hari: Okay and Dave, the transitions, you guys talked about calendar 22, a bit strong mid to high teens on the DRAM side and approximately 30% of the NAND side in line with the industry. What portion of that growth? Are you guys expecting purely from transitions to 1-alpha --
Dave Zinsner: Forget that again. It's all from no transitions, we're not adding wafers. We don't see, for the foreseeable future, adding wafers in either DRAM or NAND. In the next few years, we might be adding wafers in DRAM as Sanjay mentioned. But NAND, we think we can continue with no transitions to support the growth.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you.
Latif Masud: Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Your question, please.
Aaron Rakers: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a little bit more about the end demand dynamics, particularly around the data center. I'm curious as we move forward, how you are thinking about the bit demand profile of the data center and the server market.  And what are you seeing as far as kind of the progression of memory to compute ratio as we move forward to next-generation CPUs? I'm just curious about how you're rolling forward the expectations over the next year and that growth profile from a bit perspective.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Within the data center both for DRAM and NAND, demand trends would be strong. In fact, data center today has become the largest market for DRAM and NAND, and will continue to grow faster than the average of the industry, both for NAND and DRAM in the foreseeable future as well.  So, it's really being driven at the trend of AI driving a greater need for memory in addressing data-intensive workloads. The BOM is going from about the memory and storage part of the BOM in the servers in data centers is going from about 30% a few years ago to around 40% now, and going to 50% in few years’ time frame as well.  And new architectures, new processors, are enabling more cores, and then more cores mean more memory attached per core, therefore, greater gigabytes per server for DRAM, as well as for NAND. DDR5, is a transition that will be occurring towards the course of the next couple of years, as well as new CPUs, get launched into production.  And DDR5 is a higher bandwidth solution. Of course, enable more value, higher performance in the applications. So that adoption will be going on, and over the course of the year is, of course, CXL and HBM, these ultra-bandwidth solutions. These will also be continuing to grow in the data center space.  So average content per server for both DRAM and SSD will also be growing over 20% on a CAGR basis in each of these applications. So, a strong opportunity ahead, and Micron is very well placed with respect to our own product portfolio in terms of SSDs displacing HDDs, in terms of us providing higher density memory modules for server and data center applications.  So as the cloud gets bigger, the data center market gets bigger for us, and we are very well-positioned. And this is an area we are focused on and continue to focus on expanding our product portfolio, particularly on the side of the data center SSDs. So, we look at this as a strong growth opportunity for the industry, as well as for Micron.  The value that memory and storage solutions providing in this space, is really critical for the services that our cloud customers are providing, and just keep in mind that enterprise as well while it grows at a slower rate compared to the cloud, we are seeing a resurgence in enterprise applications as well driving for overall healthy demand trends in data centers in Calendar year '22, Fiscal year '22, as well as beyond.
Aaron Rakers: And then as a quick follow-up, Dave, I'm just curious as you start the last quarter, implement some share repurchases. How do you think about the liquidity on the balance sheet or managing the Company from a cash-on-hand perspective versus continuing to learn more in on share repurchases? How much cash do you need operationally to comfortably run the Company?
Dave Zinsner: We roughly are holding about did the 30s as a percent of revenue in terms of liquidity, but $2.5 billion of that liquidity is our unused revolver, so cash is obviously less than that. We obviously have more liquidity than we need, which of course is a good opportunity as it relates to the buyback. As I mentioned, we're also going to receive $900 million from the sale of our Lehi Fab that also can be utilized for returns to shareholders.  And we are expecting healthy free cash flow in fiscal '22 as well. And so, we'll be able to leverage that. We've committed to return at least 50% of it in the form of dividends and buyback, mostly buyback.  And we could obviously go higher than that. Our authorized plan, we still have $6 billion left in our authorized plan for repurchases. And if we see the stock be weak, which of course is how we viewed it in the Fourth Quarter, we'll be aggressive about buying back stock.
Aaron Rakers: Perfect. Thank you.
Latif Masud: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could address what transitions going on in both DRAM and NAND to 1-alpha and our G2. Are there any issues that that creates from a mix standpoint in terms of it seems like it's quite a bit demand for the older products? Where are you in terms of getting qualified for the newer products? How is that affecting you guys?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Actually, we are doing very well with respect to ramping up these new nodes in production. Right on our plan in fact, in terms of yields ahead of our plans, I highlighted that the yields in these 176 layers NAND as well as 1-alpha DRAM, have ramped 20 to 30% faster than our prior 1Z generation node and the prior FG node, the last FG node.  And customer qualifications actually are going very well that these nodes, as well as I, mentioned earlier, that we are already shipping our 1-alpha in the PC space, as well as broadening its shipments to other parts of the markets as well. In fact, customers are working closely with us in qualifying these projects.  176-layer NAND-based mobile product went are from just introduction to 1-million-unit shipments in a record time. Fastest RAM in the history of the Company. So, with all these norms in production, as well as in terms of deployment in the marketplace are doing very well for ourselves. And, of course, this is all baked into the guidance that we have provided in terms of our revenue, as well as our cost expectations.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you very much.
Latif Masud: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Pitzer: Thanks, guys. Thanks for letting me ask questions. Congratulations on the solid execution. Sanjay, you're characterizing the current environment as relatively short-lived, are we supposed to read into that as we go into the February quarter, your business might normally buck normal seasonal headwinds and I guess importantly upturn to date, this memory cycle has been very different than prior memory cycles.  Typically, you have eight quarters at unabated ASP, growth, and margin expansion. The least plateaued in year three quarters into it. What's different about this cycle? And I guess what makes you confident this is just a pause and not something more?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So with respect to the comment on the short-lived just to be clear what I was mentioning was that with respect to the PC part of the market where our customers, some of our customers in the PC market, have experienced semiconductor shortages impacting their decisions on purchases of memory, that's what I was mentioning short-lived because their end-user demand on PCs is still very strong and lot of unmet demand that actually stretches the demand over time and make the demand longer, stronger for longer.  But my comment regarding short-lived and adjusting it in the next few months was related to the PC part of the market and outside of that, in other markets, as we discussed earlier, we see strong demand trends, strong end-user demand trends.  And of course, the supply chain shortages that are being experienced in PC, are also being experienced in other parts of our markets as well by our customers. Whereby, of course, different customers handing them an overall different fashion, but the underlying demand trends are driven by AI and 5G from the data center to the Intelligent Edge, to the user devices are strong, they are circular in nature.  COVID, further accelerated it, semi-conductor supply chain shortages are only stretching the demand out as -- because some of the demand gets pushed out. So, as I said, making those demand growth drivers actually stronger for longer as well. So, you can call it pent-up demand, but that's what I'm referring to.  So, on the demand side, things are here overall strong on the supply chain aspects. Of course, this is something that the lead time in the semiconductors is long, and this will take several quarters to continue to improve. Parts of the semiconductor supply chain have already seen improvements. Our expectation is that these will continue to improve as well over the course of the coming quarters.  Also keep in mind that our industry, the memory industry, over the course of the last couple of years has stepped into the inventory to ship beyond the supply growth. And this is a phenomenon that has occurred across the industry, certainly you're seeing that how Micron has brought its inventory to the leanest level in many years, in fact, below our target inventory levels. So, this is something that is common to all suppliers in the memory industry.  And as we look ahead, the supply growth will not only have to meet the customer requirements, but it will also have to replenish the inventory that has been taken to such low levels, inventory has to be replenished in order to make sure that we are able to service our customers and meet their demand requirements, which from time-to-time change.  So, these are all factors as well, very lean levels of inventory by the suppliers, as well as need to replenish that inventory will drive for a healthy demand-supply balance in calendar year '22-time frame as well. So yes, some of this is in terms of our own supply chain shortages and some that are being experienced by our customers.  We expect to be addressed over the course of time and some of these shortages on the semi-conductor ecosystem may take through the '22-time frame. By the end of 22 maybe some of them will be [Indiscernible].  However, we expect them to continue to be improving through the course of time all the way through calendar year '22. But the demand dynamics of the underlying strong drivers and the supply dynamics that I discussed including the prudent CapEx investments that have gone on in the industry and the lean supply, all of this will lead to a healthy supply-demand environment in the industry.  So, it's really the combination of the demand drivers and their suppliers - supply capabilities and shipment capabilities, that combination, I think really sets us up well as an industry for revenue growth and strong profitability in '22, and of course, we have projected based on our expectations, that we will have record revenue in fiscal year '22 and solid profitability as well.
John Pitzer: Sanjay, those inventory comments were very helpful. I'm just curious as a quick follow-on, your guidance for bids to be down in the November quarter. How much is that a conscious decision by you to hold bits off the market to help me be pushing pricing, and how much of that is just being driven by there's no demand for those bits and that's why bits are down?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Again, keep in mind that our inventory is very lean. It is at the leanest level and below our target levels, and that is impacting some of our ability to meet the demand as well. And overall, our projection of this, the respect to FQ1, is really a function of our own supply chain capabilities in terms of where our inventories and what we can ship at this point to the customers certainly impacted by some of the component shortages, non-memory components shortages that we are seeing in the marketplace as well, and our assessment of overall demand.  And the main thing there is really is around the PC, where some of the demand is impacted. But overall, when you look at our guidance for FQ1, which takes into account any aspects of seasonality as well. But the guidance for FQ1 at this midpoint is about 32%, 33% higher than the same quarter last year. So, our inventory capability is also overall impacting some of the ability for our customers, in terms of what we can ship.
John Pitzer: Perfect. Thank you.
Latif Masud: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri of UBS. Your line is open.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I appreciate that. Dave, I guess I had a question on gross margin. I wanted to go back to a question asked earlier. It's down on the 100 basis points on your guidance; I would like a deep percent down revenue quarter NAND it sounds like you're only down modestly at both DRAM and NAND. So, it sounds like the delta is probably pricing.  I would think more on the DRAM side. And then somebody asked you about costs and you said, well, costs aren't coming down very much. So, I guess I'm trying to figure out how gross margin is so good? Is this going back to some of the mixed comments that you made ASP quarter? It seems like a more sustainable trend that maybe people were missing. So, I'm wondering if you can flip that for us next.
Dave Zinsner: Yes, sure Tim. So cost declines are going to be relatively muted. Remember that. There will be some mix changes that might impact gross margin to bring it down somewhere within the range that we gave.  Obviously, the rest is a function of pricing, and you have to infer what you can't out of pricing. Obviously, if the mix is the predominant factor in driving gross margin, pricing and cost will not be major factors in driving gross margins. Maybe that's the best way to say it.
Timothy Arcuri: Got it. Okay. And then I guess just last thing. So just on the cost curve, so you reached -- you said you’re reached production crossover on 176 and on 1-alpha and 1Z. So how much -- like what's the lag effect in terms of when that really starts to bend the cost curve in a favorable direction, given that you've had production crossover on those things. Thanks.
Dave Zinsner: Well, to be clear, 1-alpha and 1z, we've hit crossover 136, we hit at the end of the year. By the way, benefiting us from a cost perspective, it's hard to see it may be as much just because we're getting a little bit impacted obviously on the back end, which is impacting the cost declines.  But next year, we do anticipate that both of them will drive good cost reductions for us on the front-end side. So, they will be good. Good notes for us in terms of cost structure and I think we'll see that from a front-end perspective every quarter.  Again, I think the first couple of quarters, may not be as noticeable in our cost per bit calculations because of this, more of a headwind on the back-end side of the cost structure. But after we get behind that, I think you'll see that show up on the cost per bit basis as well. The only other factor will obviously be mix as well and we're going to drive like heck, to get our mix to be more -- to be a richer mix of higher-value products and -- which is always our goal.  And of course, with higher-value products, you get higher costs, but higher profitability, higher gross margins. So that's a good strategy, but that also kind of distorts the picture and will distort the picture over the course of the year as well.
Timothy Arcuri: Perfect. Awesome. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-06-30 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Josh, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Micron’s Third Quarter 2021 Financial Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Farhan Ahmad, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.
Farhan Ahmad: Thank you, and welcome to Micron Technology’s fiscal third quarter 2021 financial conference call. On the call with me today are Sanjay Mehrotra, President and CEO; and Dave Zinsner, Chief Financial Officer. Today’s call will be approximately 60 minutes in length. This call, including the audio and slides, is also being webcast from our Investor Relations website at investors.micron.com. In addition, our website contains the earnings press release and the prepared remarks filed a short while ago. Today’s discussion of financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures may be found on our website. As a reminder, a webcast replay will be available on our website later today. We encourage you to monitor our website at micron.com throughout the quarter for the most current information on the Company, including information on the various financial conferences that we will be attending. You can follow us on Twitter at MicronTech. As a reminder, the matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today. We refer you to the Form 10-K and 10-Q that we file with the SEC, for a discussion of risks that may affect our future results. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after today’s date to conform these statements to actual results. I’ll now turn the call over to Sanjay.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Farhan. Good afternoon, everyone. We delivered outstanding results in FQ3. Our strong execution enabled us to achieve the largest sequential EPS improvement in our history and to set multiple revenue records. NAND hit record revenue, propelled by a record mobile MCP, consumer SSD, and client SSD revenues. Our embedded business exceeded $1 billion for the first time, with record revenue across automotive and industrial markets. We also achieved key technology and product milestones, with our industry-leading 1-alpha DRAM and 176-layer NAND, reaching a meaningful portion of our bit production and QLC NAND accounting for a majority of our client SSD bit shipments. We expect DRAM and NAND supply to remain tight into calendar 2022 as the global economy rebounds. The strong demand for memory and storage across the data center, intelligent edge and user devices puts Micron in the best position ever to fully capitalize on these exciting opportunities. We continue to make solid progress on our goals to deliver industry-leading technology and improve our cost structure, to bring differentiated products to market and improve our product mix, and to grow our share of industry profits while maintaining stable bit share. I will start with an update on our operations. Despite shortages across the semiconductor ecosystem in various assembly materials and assembly capacity, Micron delivered record assembly output this quarter, which helped fuel our strong revenue performance. Our assembly and test success was the result of a strategic decision we made several years ago to increase our captive footprint and strengthen relationships with suppliers and partners. We successfully mitigated the impacts of the drought in Taiwan with no reduction in our production output. Taiwan’s rainy season has begun, bringing with it sufficient water supply to support our manufacturing requirements. While the drought in Taiwan is behind us, the rise in COVID-19 cases in Malaysia, India, and Taiwan are a risk to our manufacturing operations and R&D activities in these regions. We are also working with local governments to facilitate on-site testing and vaccination for Micron team members where possible. Additionally, in order to protect Micron team members at our Muar, Malaysia back-end facility, we temporarily reduced our on-site workforce early in FQ4, which reduced output levels. We have since started bringing back team members to the site as the situation has improved. While we ramp back toward full production levels in Muar, we will utilize our global supply chain, including subcontractor partners, to meet our customer commitments and minimize any disruption to delivery schedules. Earlier this year, we announced our decision to exit 3D XPoint development and manufacturing and to reprioritize our R&D investments toward new CXL-enabled memory solutions. CXL, or Compute Express Link, is a new industry standard interface that will significantly change data center architecture through high-performance connectivity between compute, memory and storage. We are developing exciting CXL-enabled products and will have more to share on our roadmap in the future. As part of our exit from the 3D XPoint business, we announced our intent to sell our Lehi, Utah, fab. Today, I’m pleased to report that Micron has reached an agreement to sell the fab to Texas Instruments in a transaction that we expect to close later this calendar year. We see this transaction as positive for our team members, the Lehi community and our shareholders. The Lehi site has been an important part of the Micron network and responsible for many technology and manufacturing innovations across NAND and 3D XPoint products. Texas Instruments will offer all Lehi team members the opportunity to become TI employees at the Lehi site upon closing. After the sale closes, we will be able to eliminate the remaining underloading costs we were incurring at Lehi, enhancing our efficiency and strengthening our profitability. Dave will provide additional details. Now for an update on technology and products. Our industry-leading 1-alpha DRAM and 176-layer NAND process technologies are now in production and ramping according to plan. These nodes accounted for a meaningful portion of our bit production in FQ3 and are on track to become a meaningful portion of our revenue in FQ4. We expect that, by end of calendar 2021, the combination of 1-alpha and 1z DRAM nodes will represent the majority of our DRAM bit production, and at the same time, 176-layer NAND will be the majority of our NAND bit production. In fiscal year 2022, we expect these workhorse nodes to fuel bit growth and provide us with good front-end cost reduction on a like-for-like basis. However, there are two factors that will create cost headwinds for us next fiscal year. The first is driven by our strategic portfolio migration toward more advanced and higher-value products such as DDR5 memory, high-density server modules and SSDs. While this portfolio shift helps us increase profit share, it will also impact our costs next fiscal year. The second cost headwind is driven by several actions we have taken in our supply chain to increase resilience and provide business continuity to our customers across all product lines. While these actions will allow us to capitalize on robust market demand, they will also impact our costs. We are on track to support customers as they begin to introduce DDR5-enabled platforms in the second half of calendar 2021. DDR5 was designed to meet modern data center requirements, including improved performance through doubling of memory bandwidth and improved reliability and efficiency through integration of on-die ECC. DDR5 features a larger die size compared to DDR4, limiting DRAM industry supply growth and cost reduction as it ramps, starting from the second half of calendar 2021. In storage, we introduced the industry’s first UFS 3.1 solution for automotive applications this quarter. We also announced volume production of client PCIe Gen4 SSDs built on the world’s first 176-layer NAND and available in a variety of form factors. We are delivering 176-layer NAND in volume to OEM and channel customers across multiple markets and have several products in customer qualifications. We are also driving an increased mix of QLC NAND, which brings down the cost of SSDs, accelerating the replacement of hard drives. QLC SSD adoption continues to grow, and we delivered record QLC SSD revenue and bit mix in FQ3. Turning to end markets. In the data center, integration of AI into data-centric workloads will drive long-term growth, with memory and storage becoming an increasing portion of server BOM cost. Propelled by the transition to DDR5, strong capabilities in graphics memory and the introduction of HBM and NVMe SSD product offerings, Micron’s strong product roadmap across DRAM and NAND positions us for success in the data center. We will enhance our NVMe SSD portfolio with the introduction of new products with internally designed controllers in the coming months. In FQ3, data center DRAM revenue grew quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong demand from cloud customers and increases in module density. Data center SSD bit shipments and revenue grew sequentially, driven by both cloud and enterprise. Data center demand is expected to be strong in the second half of calendar 2021 as cloud demand picks up and enterprise demand improves due to broad economic recovery. In addition, we expect that the new CPUs featuring more memory channels will accelerate server memory demand starting later this year and continuing into 2022. The PC market continues to benefit from the trend toward greater mobility as people embrace a work or learn-from-anywhere culture. Industry expectations for calendar 2021 PC unit demand growth have increased to the high teens, driven by robust notebook sales and a recovery in the desktop market. In the fiscal third quarter, we achieved several customer qualifications for our 1-alpha-based DDR4 products across various PC platforms. Our client SSD bit shipments were up sharply quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. In graphics, bit shipments increased sequentially and year-over-year, driven by strong next-generation game console and graphics card shipments. Micron has an excellent position in the graphics market, with a broad product portfolio and deep customer partnerships. Mobile business achieved record MCP quarterly revenue. We made strong progress with our 1-alpha LPDRAM products and 176-layer UFS 3.1-enabled solutions. We have already completed customer qualifications for some of these products. While COVID-19 has softened mobile demand in parts of Asia, supply shifts to address stronger demand in other regions are keeping the global market in tight supply-demand balance. Mobile unit sales are expected to show healthy growth this year, with some variability across geographies, driven by an expected doubling of 5G units in calendar 2021 to more than 500 million units. These 5G phones also feature rich content demanding significantly higher DRAM and NAND. We are also encouraged to see bold OEM innovation in new devices like gaming smartphones featuring 18 gigabyte of DRAM. Our automotive business delivered a third consecutive record quarter, driven by continued manufacturing recovery and increased LPDDR4 and eMMC content for in-vehicle infotainment and driver assistance applications. Auto unit sales are expected to grow significantly from last year. Auto memory and storage content growth trends remain strong, particularly as EVs, which have significantly higher memory and storage content requirements, grow much faster than the broader auto market. We are continuing to see record automotive and industrial segment demand, yet despite our best efforts, we may be unable to meet all the demand from these customers over the next few months due to certain non-memory semiconductor component shortages in our supply chain. Turning to our market outlook. While the pandemic remains a risk factor, calendar 2021 is shaping up to be a strong year fueled by the macroeconomic recovery combined with secular drivers, such as AI and 5G, that are creating sustained demand increases across broad end markets. As a result, our expectations for calendar 2021 DRAM and NAND bit growth have increased since our last earnings call, and we now expect calendar 2021 DRAM bit demand growth to be somewhat above 20% and NAND bit demand growth in the mid 30% range. There is currently unmet demand for DRAM and NAND due to end market strength. This unmet demand would have been even larger had it not been for the non-memory component shortages influencing our customers’ ability to manufacture their products, particularly in the PC, automotive and industrial markets. These shortages can cause variability in demand patterns as customers experience challenges sourcing matched sets of non-memory components. We are hopeful that foundry capacity coming online can begin to alleviate some of the component shortages in the second half of calendar 2021 and support robust memory and storage growth. Additionally, as a result of strong end market demand trends, the lessons of the pandemic and ongoing geopolitical uncertainty, some customers will change their inventory management strategy from just-in-time to just-in-case and increase the target level of what they consider normal inventory levels. Long term, we see a DRAM bit demand growth CAGR of mid to high teens and a NAND bit demand growth CAGR of approximately 30%. Turning to Micron supply, we are targeting to align our long-term bit supply growth CAGR with the industry bit demand growth CAGR across DRAM and NAND. However, we expect year-to-year variability caused by node-transition timing. In both DRAM and NAND, we expect our calendar 2021 bit supply growth to be below the industry bit demand growth, and we have used our inventory to add to our bit shipment growth this year. Before handing over to Dave, I have one more important announcement to share regarding our DRAM technology and manufacturing strategy. Based on our assessment of the progress EUV has been making and aligned with our technology strategy and industry-leading DRAM scaling roadmap, we plan to insert EUV into our DRAM roadmap starting in the 2024 timeframe. Micron has placed purchase orders for multiple EUV tools from ASML as part of a long-term volume agreement. The pre-payments for these systems will contribute towards the fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2022 CapEx. We have increased our fiscal year 2021 CapEx to be somewhat above $9.5 billion, mostly from areas that do not impact calendar 2021 and fiscal year 2022 bit growth, such as these EUV pre-payments, construction spending and other R&D and corporate items. I will now turn it over to Dave.
Dave Zinsner: Thanks, Sanjay. Micron delivered outstanding FQ3 results. Revenue and EPS grew by a record amount sequentially on an organic basis, and we generated over $1.5 billion in free cash flow in the quarter. Total FQ3 revenue was approximately $7.4 billion, up 19% quarter-over-quarter and up 36% year-over-year. Revenue growth was driven by stronger DRAM and NAND pricing and by robust customer demand for Micron’s products. FQ3 DRAM revenue was $5.4 billion, representing 73% of total revenue. DRAM revenue increased 23% sequentially and was up 52% year-over-year. Bit shipments increased in the low single-digit range sequentially, and ASPs were up approximately 20% quarter-over-quarter. FQ3 NAND revenue was approximately $1.8 billion, representing 24% of total revenue and an all-time high for the Company. NAND revenue increased 10% sequentially and was up 9% year-over-year. Bit shipments increased by low single digits sequentially while ASPs increased in the high single-digit percentage range quarter-over-quarter. Now turning to our revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the Compute and Networking Business Unit was approximately $3.3 billion, up approximately 25% sequentially and 49% year-over-year. CNBU revenue growth was driven by broad-based sequential pricing increases. Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $2 billion, up 10% sequentially and 31% year-over-year. Mobile demand remained healthy as 5G handset sales continue to ramp. Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $1 billion, up approximately 19% from the prior quarter and approximately flat year-over-year. Both client and consumer SSD revenues set records. And finally, the Embedded Business Unit generated record revenue of $1.1 billion, which was up 18% sequentially and 64% year-over-year. Automotive and industrial revenues were at an all-time high for the Company. The consolidated gross margin for FQ3 was 42.9%, up 10 percentage points from the prior quarter. DRAM and NAND price increases helped drive the margin expansion in FQ3. Gross margins also benefited by 100 basis points from $75 million less depreciation at our Lehi fab, which is classified as “assets held for sale.” Operating expenses were $821 million in FQ3, which we continue to tightly manage. Operating expenses also benefited from approximately $21 million of gains from the sales of certain assets. FQ3 operating income was $2.4 billion, resulting in an operating margin of 32%, compared to 20% in the prior quarter and 18% in the prior year’s quarter. FQ3 EBITDA was $4 billion, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 53%, compared to 45% in the prior quarter and 44% in the prior year. Net interest expense was $31 million in FQ3, and we expect it to be roughly flat going forward. Our FQ3 effective tax rate was 8.4%. We expect our tax rate to be in the high single digits for FQ4. Non-GAAP earnings per share in FQ3 were $1.88, up from $0.98 in FQ2. The $0.90 sequential improvement was the largest in Micron’s history. EPS included approximately $0.05 from the sale of certain assets, investment gains from Micron Ventures and one-time tax items. Turning to cash flows and capital spending. We generated approximately $3.6 billion in cash from operations in FQ3, representing 48% of revenue. Net capital spending was approximately $2 billion during the quarter. As Sanjay mentioned, we now expect our FY21 capital spending to be somewhat higher than $9.5 billion. Most of this CapEx increase that we are highlighting today will not increase our CY21 and CY22 bit supply. We expect that while we invest in the EUV infrastructure and initial deployment, our capital intensity will increase to mid-30% of revenues. Once we get past the investment period of EUV adoption, we expect that these tools will boost our competitiveness and help drive productivity of our fabs. As a result of the strong market environment and Micron’s extraordinary execution, we generated positive free cash flow of $1.5 billion in FQ3. The increased cash flow was driven by strong revenue growth, higher margins and efficient working capital management. We expect free cash flow to continue to improve in the fourth quarter, driven by continuing growth in revenue and earnings. We completed share repurchases of $150 million, or approximately 1.7 million shares, in FQ3. From the inception of the share repurchase program, we have repurchased $3 billion worth of Micron stock, representing 55% of our cumulative free cash flow. In addition, since FY19, we have used approximately $2 billion in cash to settle conversions of our convertible notes, including approximately $800 million to settle the convert premiums. Combining the share repurchases and convert premiums, we have used $3.8 billion or 69% of our cumulative free cash flow toward reducing our share count. We plan to continue repurchasing shares in FQ4. Ending FQ3 inventory was $4.5 billion or 98 days. We remain in a very lean inventory position as demand continues to outstrip our supply. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $9.8 billion and total liquidity of approximately $12.3 billion. FQ3 ending total debt was $6.7 billion. Our balance sheet is rock solid, with investment-grade ratings from all three rating agencies. In the last three months, Fitch and Standard & Poor’s both raised their outlook from stable to positive for Micron debt. These upgrades to the outlook for our debt ratings are further evidence of the financial transformation underway at Micron. Before providing the financial outlook, I want to cover the financial implications of the sale of our Lehi fab. We are pleased with this transaction and believe that it is good for our shareholders, as it frees up capital and enhances our ongoing profitability. The economic value for Micron from the sale is $1.5 billion, comprised of $900 million in cash resulting from the sales transaction and approximately $600 million in value for select tools and other assets that Micron will retain for redeployment to its other manufacturing sites, or that are sold to other buyers. We are taking an impairment charge of approximately $435 million, or approximately $330 million on an after-tax basis, as the $900 million sale price is below our book value of the assets being sold. Note that the tools that we are keeping have largely been depreciated but have substantial future value in our manufacturing network. As we have previously disclosed, we stopped depreciation of the Lehi fab assets last quarter and this benefited our costs by approximately $75 million in FQ3. Once the sale is completed, we will further improve our profitability by entirely eliminating our underload charges. Now turning to our near-term outlook. Both DRAM and NAND markets are tight, and we expect pricing increases for both markets in the fiscal fourth quarter. In FQ4, we’re qualifying 1-alpha and 176-layer nodes with several customers. We expect these nodes to support a modest level of bit growth and face cost headwinds that are common at this stage of the ramp. Additionally, we also expect cost headwinds from product mix and COVID mitigation. Despite cost headwinds, we expect strong improvement in our financial performance in FQ4. Our growth opportunity is healthy, and market momentum heading into fiscal year 2022 is strong. With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for FQ4 is as follows: We expect revenue to be $8.2 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in the range of 47%, plus or minus 100 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $900 million, plus or minus $25 million. Finally, based on a share count of approximately 1.15 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $2.30, plus or minus $0.10. Micron’s relentless focus on execution positions us well to generate solid returns for our shareholders. Measuring our performance trough to trough across the cycle from FY16 to FY20, we substantially improved our EBITDA margin, and our revenue grew by more than 70%. During this time, we delivered average gross margins of 40%, EBITDA margins of 50% and return on invested capital of 20%. We believe Micron’s strong financial performance will continue cross-cycle, and over the long term, our revenue growth will outperform the broader semiconductor industry. Our industry-leading technology, dramatically improved product portfolio and financial strength position us well to capitalize on the long-running demand trends driving the memory and storage industry. I will now turn it back to Sanjay.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Dave. Micron’s fiscal third quarter results demonstrate the strength of our business, and we expect to achieve continued strong results in the future. Demand for memory and storage is solid across market segments, and industry trends like artificial intelligence, edge computing and 5G continue to create new opportunities for Micron. Our team is building on our technology leadership to deliver bold new solutions that offer valuable differentiation for our customers. Micron’s business is healthier and more robust than ever, and we’re energized to seize the opportunities ahead at a truly exciting time in the semiconductor industry. We are also leveraging our success to deliver results for all our stakeholders. In April, we released our sixth annual sustainability report, highlighting progress towards our environmental, social and governance goals. I am pleased to report that we are on track to achieve the environmental and sustainability goals we set last year, despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. In fact, our ESG risk scores have improved to the top 10% of the semiconductor industry according to the third-party rating agency Sustainalytics. We are also making good progress on achieving 100% renewable energy consumption in the U.S. by the end of 2025. In calendar 2021, we continue to focus on emissions abatement, transition to renewable sources, water restoration and increased efforts to reduce, reuse or recycle waste. We will pursue these goals with the same focus with which we have created sustained momentum in the business, and I look forward to providing updates on our progress on future calls. We will now open for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. You may proceed with your question.
C.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, end-market demand question. There’s clearly fears out there around PC speaking volatility around handsets and –whether there’s any inventory build on the cloud side. Yet here, you’re talking about DRAM and NAND remaining tight into calendar 2022. So, I guess, can you walk through what you’re seeing out there from a demand perspective? And then also, I think very importantly, particularly to the DRAM side, how you’re thinking about supply, which clearly seems to be constrained both this year and next year?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thanks, C.J. So, on the demand side, we certainly see strong demand across almost all end markets. PC, on a year-over-year basis in calendar year 2021, the growth is in high-teens. And, of course, the SSD attach rate average content continues to increase on the NAND side and continue -- PC continues to drive healthy demand for DRAM as well. Our data center, after the digestion period earlier in the year in the second half, driving strong demand for us as well. Smartphone, 5G trends driving unit sales as well as average content growth. Automotive, we can’t meet the supply. We can’t meet the demand that is strong there. Industrial markets, the demand is strong. So, across the Board, almost across all end markets, we are seeing strong demand. In fact, in the industry, there is unmet demand. And you know that there is semiconductor shortage across the technology ecosystem. And as that semiconductor shortage gets alleviated over time, that actually is going to create more demand for memory and storage because every end application today, whether it’s analog IC-related or memory, CPU cores-related, all of them actually required memory and storage. So semiconductor shortage, which is actually impacting some of the demand, as that gets alleviated over the course of next seven quarters, that too will bring about increased demand. So, demand trends are strong. The supply, as we see through the year, through the end of the year and into calendar year 2022, is tight as well. And you know that CapEx in the industry has been on the DRAM side, extremely disciplined. The producer inventories, the supplier inventories are running extremely lean as well. I can certainly speak for our inventory. Our days of inventory are at 98, extremely low as well. And capital intensity is increasing as well in the industry, and that all bodes well for disciplined supply growth as well. We talked about that how DDR5 as a spec that is there in the industry, as a JEDEC spec, actually requires more on chip ECC that results in bigger die sizes for everybody in the industry for DDR5 over DDR4. So that, again, as you can well understand, as the industry transitions to DDR5 over the course of next several quarters in 2022 as well as in 2023, that too means less supply growth availability from the wafers, even with technology transitions, and so, all of those trends from the demand side as well as from the supply side bode well for our industry.
C.J. Muse: That’s very helpful. If I could follow-up on the gross margin side, Dave, you talked in the prepared remarks around higher cost mix and investment in the supply chain. Can you walk through the moving parts there for fiscal 2022 gross margins?
Dave Zinsner: So obviously, one of the bigger components of the margins for fiscal 2022 is going to be around pricing. And we don’t provide pricing beyond the next fiscal -- beyond this quarter, other than to say that we think pricing will be up next quarter, and we are suggesting that it would be tight at least into 2022. So, that’s as much as I can give you on the pricing side. On the cost front, when you look at the front-end cost reductions that we’ll see next year on a like-for-like basis, driven by, as Sanjay mentioned in the prepared remarks, the ramp of 1-alpha and the ramp of 176 on the NAND front, we do feel like those costs will be good. The only counter to that is we will see a higher mix of products that carry higher costs. Sanjay mentioned like DDR5, higher density server modules, as more SSDs, all those things will be a bit of a headwind on the cost front. And we will likely go into the year with some COVID mitigation costs. That also will be a bit of a headwind. Now hopefully, that over the course of the year, alleviates and that starts to help on the margin front. The only other factor is we will have a little bit of a lift in Q4 from Lehi as the full amount of depreciation goes away in the fiscal fourth quarter. And then, once we close on the sale, all the underload charges will also go away. The way I think I’d model it is maybe about $20 million of benefit in the fourth quarter and probably another $20 million in the first fiscal quarter and assuming we close somewhere close towards the end of the first fiscal quarter, we should be -- that should be behind us.
C.J. Muse: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. You may proceed with your question.
John Pitzer: Yes, guys. Just two quick questions. Dave, maybe to follow-up on C.J.’s questions about cost. I want to make sure I understand the messaging here. I get that these higher value-added parts have higher costs, but should they also have higher gross margins, or am I thinking about that incorrectly? And then, I have a follow-up.
Dave Zinsner: It somewhat depends on the product itself. But I would say, in general, we are trying to drive towards higher value products, which arguably on a like-for-like -- or at least on a comparable basis to other products would carry better gross margins.
John Pitzer: Perfect. And then, as my follow-up, two quarters ago, Dave, you didn’t buy back any stock. This quarter, it was $150 million, which was I think 10% of free cash flow, notwithstanding what you’ve done over multiple quarters. I’m just kind of curious as to the message you’re trying to give us here, especially if you look at sort of the cross-cycle risk reward in the stock, why not be more aggressive with the buyback here? And does that portend something about next fiscal year’s CapEx? And as you’ve talked about that CapEx, is next fiscal year a year that you should outgrow bits relative to the industry?
Dave Zinsner: Okay. A lot of questions on pack. Okay. So, on the buyback, I wouldn’t read anything into the $150 million. Some quarters, we’ll have higher levels of buyback than others. We were -- we did have an eye on our net cash position. And so, that was something that we were trying to move in the right direction. I think you’ll find in the fourth fiscal quarter that our buybacks are meaningfully higher than our third fiscal quarter. So, nothing to read there. We do feel like this price is obviously a good price to be buying the stock back. And we are committed to what we’ve talked about previously, which is to return at least 50% of our free cash flow in the form of buybacks. And as we -- as I talked about on the prepared remarks, I think the metric we’ve hit so far is 55%. So, we’ve done pretty well. And that doesn’t even account for the converts, which I think by the end of this fiscal quarter, that is the fourth fiscal quarter, will be completely done with converged, conversions will be completely off the balance sheet, and we will remove that dilution as well. As it relates -- no message on the CapEx as it relates to buybacks, other than to say that given the EUV investments, it does appear that we will operate maybe at a little bit of a different level from a percent of sales perspective than perhaps we previously were operating. We were thinking more in the low 30s. I think with EUV, it’s safe to say that we probably are operating in the mid-30s as a percent of revenue for CapEx, at least as we build out the EUV part of the tool set.
John Pitzer: Perfect. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: I had a question about DRAM ASPs. 20% quarter-over-quarter growth was the highest in several years. So, you can talk -- can you talk a bit about the drivers of the growth? How much of it was like-for-like price increases given the current tight supply versus, say, benefit from mix? And how should we think about sustainability?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, certainly, on a like-for-like basis, pricing increased across the board in the DRAM industry, and again, driven by the strong demand, as I mentioned earlier, pretty much across all of the end markets. So, we enjoyed price increases across all end markets. And as we have mentioned that even in FQ4, we see price increases not just in DRAM, but we also see that in NAND.
Shannon Cross: Okay. And then, I guess, given the conversation or comments you made about customers moving to just-in-case inventory management, can you unpack that a little bit just in terms of magnitude? I mean, is this sort of a one-off conversations you’re having with people as they’re dealing with the supply issues that are out there right now, or do you think this is something that’s going to be sort of a meaningful transition within the industry? Thanks.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, we see it as an emerging trend in the industry. When you think about it over the course of last couple of years or even maybe a somewhat longer time frame, there have been challenges with respect to geopolitical consolidations. Certainly, COVID brought into stark relief the need for resilient, flexible supply chain. And when you look at all the acceleration of the digital transformation and the surge in demand that has occurred, and on top of it, impose semiconductor industry shortages that are leaving a lot of the unmet demand across multiple industries here, all of that is really leading the customer ecosystem as well as us, the suppliers, to really absolutely prepare for supply chain so that we can meet the demand. I mean, Micron itself has taken actions in this regard in terms of securing capacity, for example, for assembly operations and that has really enabled us, for example, when our Muar operation, we had to bring down our team members there because of the recent COVID outbreak in Malaysia. Because we had made changes to our capacity -- assembly capacity footprint, we have secured more external supply, assembly capacity that enabled us to quickly shift our production to other parts of our manufacturing footprint. These are the kind of considerations that customers, in general, and suppliers, in general, are considering to make sure that they’re able to manage their supply chains to be able to meet the end-customer demand. And that’s why, certainly, some of the just-in-time aspects of inventory management have proved to be costly over the course of last few quarters, particularly, as the world has struggled to respond to the needs during the COVID time frame. And yes, there is an emerging trend towards considering just-in-case, whether it is related to geopolitical considerations, whether it is related to acts of God, that can result in supply chain disruptions or just responding from challenges of COVID. So, this is an emerging trend. And some of the customers may have already reacted faster in terms of building stronger inventory positions. Other customers perhaps still scrambling to meet the requirements, but this is definitely a trend that we think will likely persist with companies as they think about their own supply continuity considerations in the future. Just like Micron itself has taken the steps necessary to address its own customer requirements and fulfilling their demands.
Operator: Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I had two questions, first on EUV and then on cost down. So Sanjay, I guess, the first question on EUV is sort of what’s changed on EUV? I mean, it’s not like there’s been a sea change in progress made on EUV. Is it simply maybe that there’s another big chipmaker trying to get in the queue and taking up some slots and so you felt like you had to get in the queue? So, I’m just sort of curious what changed on EUV? And then, I had a follow-up.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, we had always said that we monitor EUV progress. We have actually engaged in EUV evaluation. We have had EUV tool in the past. So, we had always said that we will intercept EUV in our roadmap at the right time when we see the EUV platform as well as the ecosystem becomes more mature. That’s when we plan to intercept EUV in our roadmap. And that’s what our plan is that in the 2024 timeframe, and again, aligned with our technology and leadership DRAM scaling roadmap that we’ll be implementing this in 2024 timeframe. So, it’s consistent with how we have always approached it. And of course, EUV has continued to make good progress, and we really think that with our EUV technology capability from 2024 onward timeframe, coupled with our multi-patterning expertise that Micron has a leadership in the industry, we really will have unique differentiated capabilities and absolutely feel confident about continuing to lead our DRAM scaling roadmap through our, of course, currently 1-alpha, but then 1-beta and then 1-gamma and beyond. And initially, we will deploy EUV in limited layer count in 2024 timeframe with our 1-gamma node and then we will broaden it to the 1-delta node with greater layer adoption and just keep in mind that we will combine it with our immersion multi-patterning techniques as well. And so, we really believe that we will have a very strong roadmap. And this is pretty much along the lines of how we always intended to insert EUV in our roadmap in the future, basically keeping in track of cost effectiveness, productivity as well as our overall scaling roadmap, and we feel really good about our leadership, DRAM scaling roadmap ahead.
Timothy Arcuri: And I guess, Dave, my follow-up is on cost downs. You sound a little more negative or a little more cautious on your fiscal 2022 cost downs than you were last quarter. I think, this year in DRAM, you’re going to be close to roughly 10% this fiscal year. And I think 1-alpha was supposed to help you next year. So, the feeling was that you could do better than 10% next year in fiscal 2022. But, it sounds like maybe some of these mix issues are going to result in you doing worse next year than you did this year? Can you sort of give us what next year is relative to the -- to sort of what you’ve done this year? Thanks.
Dave Zinsner: So, I don’t think I’m ready to -- we haven’t completely finished the plans on next year. So, maybe it’s a little premature for me to talk about next year, specifically on cost downs. I would say that when you look at 1-alpha’s cost declines, they are very, very good. The timing in which the 1-alpha ramps is certainly an impact, and when it gets to its mature yield state is certainly an impact. And then, of course, it’s hard to call these mixed elements that drive some headwinds. But suffice it to say, when you kind of think about what our strategy is, we do feel that we’ll see many of these things enter into the equation. So, I think when you look at it on a front-end basis is quite good and quite comparable. I think when you look at it on a mix basis, somewhat dependent on how the market unfolds. But based on our early view into next year in terms of the x, we’d expect some headwinds.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you. I want to follow-up on the just-in-time to just-in-case inventory question. You’re talking about demand not being fulfilled in the short term. So, is the message here that the customers don’t really have inventory, but that they want to put that inventory into place, or are there pockets where there’s inventory kind of waiting for other components?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, again, this really varies from customer to customer. Some customers may have reacted fast and would be carrying adequate level of inventory or inventory in line with their strategy in terms of how to cope with the current environment with respect to demand and supply for their own components, whereas some other customers may have less level of inventory. So, really, it varies from customer to customer. So, what I’m saying is that regarding just-in-time shifting towards just-in-case kind of mindset, it really is that customer focus on managing their supply chain so that they can have sufficient inventory to meet their end-market requirements, some customers may have moved more in that direction. And some other customers may have yet to move in the direction of from just-in-time mindset towards just-in-case. So for example, the car production, we are seeing that auto market has suffered through significant supply chain shortages and, of course, have incurred significant cost to that industry as well in not being able to fulfill all their supply requirements. And of course, that then drives a different mindset on how to avoid this kind of situation in the future. So, it varies from end market to end market. It varies from customer to customer. But overall, what we are saying is that with the lessons of the geopolitical consolidations, with the lessons of the pandemic and the lessons of the recent supply chain shortages, in the backdrop of digital transformation requiring more and more of semiconductor solutions, customer ecosystem, parts of the customer ecosystem likely is approaching their inventory consolidations in a different manner compared to before. And again, we look at it as an emerging trend in the industry.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Danely with Citi.
Chris Danely: Hey. Thanks, guys. Just a follow-up on that previous question. If you look at the three main end markets for DRAM, PC, cellphone server and your, I guess, your best guess of inventory in each, where would you say it’s lowest? And then, when do you think that those end markets will achieve their, whatever the heck normal is, these days level of inventory?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, we’re not going to go there in terms of trying to break it down by market by market. Of course, you sometimes see different moving parts in different parts of the market. For example, in mobile, you saw that with the India COVID situation as well as April and May in China, there was a reduction in demand in certain parts of the smartphone market. However, in other parts of the world, the smartphone suppliers moved to supply the increased demand in the other parts of the world. And of course, some of the demand because supply is in shortage, some of the supply in the industry got shifted toward other parts of the market too. So, we’re not going to break it down. I mean, I gave you mobile just as one example. And this situation can vary from customer to customer. But all-in-all, when you look at the end markets, almost all end markets are seeing shortages. And in aggregate, there is tight supply today. That’s what is resulting in increase in prices in the industry that we reported for FQ3, and we guided to it in FQ4 also for DRAM and NAND, we see price increases. And overall, we see supply tightness continuing through the year and into 2024 timeframe as well.
Chris Danely: Well said…
Sanjay Mehrotra: I meant 2022.
Chris Danely: 2024 as well. 2024 is great. 2026, I’ll take it.
Sanjay Mehrotra: We’ll definitely talk about -- we’ll definitely be talking about that one of these days too. Yes.
Chris Danely: One quick one, Sanjay. What do you think is going to be the Chips Act impact to Micron and just the memory ecosystem in general?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, I think, when you say chipset impact, yes -- oh, Chips Act, I see. Okay. So with respect to Chips Act, we definitely -- first of all, it’s really great that U.S. government is recognizing the importance of semiconductors and how important semiconductors are to national economic consideration as well as national security considerations. And of course, semiconductors are important to all global economies today. So, we certainly look forward to greater support for U.S. leadership in semiconductor research as well as semiconductor manufacturing in the years to come. And of course, Micron, as the only player in semiconductor memory and semiconductor storage in the industry is well engaged with the U.S. government. And I know that the U.S. government also recognizes the importance of memory and storage as a strategic part of the semiconductor industry. So we really look forward to opportunities in terms of addressing our future needs. We continue to stay engaged. We stay engaged with the governments in all global sites where we have major operations, and we look forward to the opportunities here in the U.S. as well. And we are really glad that the funding has crossed the finish line in the Senate, and we certainly hope that in the House as well, this will pass. And U.S. industry can get on with the business of really strengthening U.S. leadership in research and manufacturing in semiconductor for the years to come. And we definitely remain always committed to growing our own supply in line with the industry demand, and we remain disciplined in that regard.
Operator: Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari: Hi guys. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. I have one on DRAM and one on NAND. On the DRAM side, I wanted to ask about your ability to grow bits over the next, call it, four to six quarters. I think, Dave, at a couple of conferences, you talked about bits being flattish into the August quarter, just given where you are in the transition and given low inventories. But as you progress and sort of transition to 1-alpha, at what point should we expect your bit supply to accelerate in the DRAM business? And to the extent you can’t meet demand, call it, over the next couple of quarters, how should we think about your willingness to increase capacity in DRAM? And then, on the NAND side, at a very high level, I think, Sanjay, it feels like you -- to me, it feels like you sound a little bit better on NAND supply-demand or less cautious on NAND supply-demand. Curious what’s changed over the past couple of quarters? Is it purely demand being better? Is it sort of the shortages around controllers? Yields on higher layer count nodes or all of the above? Just curious what’s changed in NAND over the past couple of months, couple of quarters. Thank you.
Dave Zinsner: Okay. So I’ll take the DRAM question first. I think, you would model, for sure, we are thinking pretty modest sequential growth in the fourth quarter in terms of DRAM. I think that will carry into the first fiscal quarter, quite honestly. I would expect a relatively gradual increase as we ramp 1-alpha and that there wouldn’t be necessarily an inflection point where we see a big step-up in the growth rates. We’ve been very focused on the supply-demand balance on -- from our perspective. And so, we have been investing in 1-alpha with that in mind. And then, just the follow-on question you had, I almost say the same thing. As we look at DRAM and as we -- actually, as we invest in DRAM and NAND, we take a long-range view in terms of the growth rates of DRAM and NAND. Sanjay mentioned that we think DRAM growth rates are in -- for DRAM, long-term growth rates are in the mid to high-teens, and we think NAND is growing -- should grow around 30% over the long term, and that’s how we invest our CapEx. And we’re always -- now year-to-year, things might be a little different than that, but we’re investing over the long run to grow our supply in relationship to that demand growth. And we have not deviated from that strategy.
Sanjay Mehrotra: And on the NAND front, yes, as you noted that we have increased our outlook in terms of year-over-year NAND industry growth to now mid-30s. At the prior discussion, NAND industry was somewhat in oversupply. What we have seen is that NAND certainly has stabilized, and the trends have improved. In fact, we talked about price increases that we experienced in FQ3 for NAND as well as have guided to price increase in NAND in FQ4 as well. So, overall, we see tightness in NAND as well through the remainder of this calendar year and into 2022, and NAND demand is being driven by elasticity and certainly, continuing strength in PCs and also data center and smartphone markets as well. Overall, our outlook has changed because the supply of inventories we believe are healthier. And certainly, Micron inventory in NAND also is running lean. And certainly, our 176-layer NAND industry-leading node is ramping well. And overall, we expect our long-term supply growth CAGR to be in line with the market there as well, so.
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-03-31 16:30:00) =====

Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Farhan. Micron delivered strong FQ2 results above our original projections, driven by solid execution and higher than expected demand across multiple end markets. The DRAM market is in severe shortage and the NAND market is showing signs of stabilization in the near-term. The execution from the Micron team and these strengthened conditions enabled us to set revenue records for mobile MCPs and automotive products and to reach normal levels of inventory ahead of schedule. Following last quarter's introduction of 176-layer NAND into volume production, in FQ2, we began volume production on our 1-alpha DRAM node, solidifying our technology leadership in both DRAM and NAND. We are in an excellent position to capitalize on the strong demand for memory and storage, driven by artificial intelligence and 5G across the data center, the intelligent edge, and user devices. I will start with an update on our operations. The Micron team is doing everything we can to meet customer demand despite the challenges of the pandemic, non-memory component shortages in the electronics industry, and disruptions that occurred in our Taiwan fabs in December. We are confident that our COVID19 safety protocols will allow us to continue at full production levels, and we are encouraged to see vaccines become increasingly available around the world. Micron has been able to mitigate the impact of broad electronics industry shortages to our production output through our proactive supply chain and inventory management strategies. Investments made over the last several years in facilities infrastructure allowed us to minimize lost output caused by the power outage and earthquake at our Taiwan operations in December. Recently, due to the drought in central Taiwan, there has been a reduction in the water supply for one of our DRAM fab sites. To mitigate the water shortage, we are accelerating our water conservation efforts and have secured alternative sources of water. At this time, we do not see an impact to DRAM production output. However, this is a developing situation that we are monitoring closely for the next several months.  Now turning to technology and products. We continue to make solid progress on our key goals; first, to deliver industry-leading technology and improve our cost structure; second, to bring differentiated products to market and improve our product mix; and third, to grow our share of industry profits while maintaining stable bit share. I am proud to report that Micron was one of the top 20 U.S. patent registrants in 2020. This achievement attests to the brilliant innovation of our teams and is proof of the tenacious focus we have placed on technology and product leadership over the past several years. Our industry-leading 1-alpha DRAM and 176-layer NAND nodes are in volume production and are ramping on plan. We expect these nodes to be our workhorse for fiscal year 2022, fueling our bit growth and contributing to our long-term cost reduction goals. Across both DRAM and NAND, we target our long-term cost reductions that are in line with the industry. In products, Micron is on track to support customers as they begin to introduce DDR5 in the fiscal second-half of 2021. We are also driving an increased mix of QLC NAND, which helps to make SSDs more cost-effective and accelerates the replacement of HDDs with SSDs. QLC SSD adoption continues to grow, and we achieved a record high QLC bit mix in FQ2. Earlier this month, Micron took a decisive step to exit 3D XPoint development and manufacturing. As mentioned on our recent 3D XPoint update call, Micron is prioritizing investment toward other memory solutions that use the Compute Express Link, or CXL, and we are excited about addressing this market opportunity with differentiated products. Most of the R&D teams previously working on 3D XPoint have already been transitioned to other programs, including accelerating introduction of CXL-enabled memory products. This change will allow Micron to better address future needs of our data center customers and also drive higher ROI and shareholder value. We are running an open process to identify the best acquirer for the Lehi fab, which provides an excellent location for advanced foundry, logic, and analog semiconductor manufacturing, and expect to finalize the sale within calendar 2021. We anticipate that the overwhelming majority of the highly skilled Lehi manufacturing team will find strong career opportunities with the buyer. Turning to end markets. In data center, AI and data-centric workloads will drive long-term growth, with memory and storage becoming an increasing portion of server BOM cost. Micron is positioned for success in this market, with a broad portfolio of high-quality and power-efficient products. Enterprise demand, which had been anemic for the last few quarters, is starting to improve as IT budgets increase in anticipation of economic recovery. Enterprise DRAM bit shipments grew sharply quarter-over-quarter, but were still down year-over-year. Cloud DRAM bit shipments also grew quarter-over-quarter and we anticipate robust demand from U.S. hyperscale customers, especially as we enter the second-half of calendar 2021. In data center SSDs, revenue declined sequentially as customers in certain segments reduced their higher than average inventory levels. We are continuing to expand our data center NVMe SSD portfolio with internally developed controllers and have new product introductions planned in the coming quarters. In PC, we continue to benefit from the remote work and learning trend that drove healthy notebook and Chromebook demand in fiscal Q2. Micron delivered record PC DRAM bit shipments despite pockets of non-memory component shortages experienced in the PC OEM supply chain. We also began sampling 1-alpha-based DDR4 products. In client SSDs, we are on track to begin customer qualification of our next-generation client SSDs using 176-layer NAND in the fiscal second-half of 2021. By the end of calendar 2021, we expect to cover multiple segments of the market, including consumer, value OEM and premium OEM with our 176-layer-based client portfolio. In graphics, revenue declined quarter-over-quarter from an exceptional fiscal first quarter, which benefited from the launch of new gaming consoles. Nevertheless, fiscal second quarter revenue grew significantly year-over-year. Micron has an excellent position in this market with a broad product portfolio and deep customer partnerships. In mobile, revenue grew 21% sequentially, driven by strong execution, coupled with better-than-seasonal demand, due to continuing recovery in smartphone volumes. We achieved record MCP revenue and nearly tripled our LP5 revenue sequentially. We have also begun sampling the industry's first 1-alpha LPDRAM and 176-layer NAND with mobile customers. Smartphone unit sales in China have been robust, and 5G momentum is continuing. In auto, we delivered a second consecutive record-revenue quarter as auto manufacturing recovers around the globe and as memory and storage content per vehicle continues to grow. We have more demand than we can supply and we are working diligently with our customers to address their memory and storage needs. We are also advancing our product portfolio targeted for automotive applications. In FQ2, we completed qualification of our auto-grade LP5 and began sampling the industry's first automotive LP5 that is hardware-evaluated to meet the most stringent Automotive Safety Integrity Level, ASIL D. Turning to the market outlook, calendar 2021 is shaping up to be a solid year, and our overall outlook across DRAM and NAND has improved since our last earnings call, with broad strength across nearly all end markets. The pandemic has driven changes in our economy that we believe will not only benefit us this year, but also serve to accelerate the digital transformation of the economy and drive new opportunities for Micron. Recovery from the pandemic and pent-up demand are expected to drive strong demand growth in markets such as enterprise, cloud, desktop PCs, mobile, auto, and industrial. Data center demand is expected to be strong in calendar 2021, particularly in the second-half of the calendar year, due to a combination of factors. First, enterprise demand has started to come back as the economy recovers and is expected to further strengthen through the calendar year. Second, our opportunity at cloud service providers will continue to strengthen through calendar 2021, driven by robust demand for their solutions and offerings, as well as secular growth in AI and data-centric workloads. And finally, the introduction of new CPUs will support more memory channels and higher-density modules, contributing to increases in server memory content across both cloud and enterprise. Forecasts for calendar 2021 PC unit sales have increased from three months ago and are expected to approach an average of one million units per day. There is robust demand in notebook PCs, especially Chromebooks. We also expect the desktop market to improve as workers gradually return to the office this year. Mobile unit sales are expected to show robust growth this year and we also expect to benefit from higher content in 5G phones, which are forecast to double in calendar 2021 to more than 500 million units. Auto unit sales are expected to grow significantly from last year, while secular memory and storage content growth trends remain strong as EVs proliferate. The strong demand across various end markets, combined with disruptions at certain logic and foundry semiconductor producers, has resulted in a shortage of these non-memory ICs for our customers, and we believe memory demand would have been even greater without these shortages. In DRAM, due to the stronger demand, we now expect calendar 2021 bit growth at 20%, above our prior forecast of high teens. This growth builds on calendar 2020 bit growth, which was in the lower 20% range. As a result of disciplined CapEx investments since the start of the pandemic, we expect industry DRAM supply to be below demand. As a result of the strong demand and limited supply, the DRAM market is currently facing a severe undersupply, which is causing DRAM prices to increase rapidly. We see the DRAM market tightening further through the year. In NAND, we now expect calendar 2021 bit growth in the low to mid-30% range, above our prior expectation of 30%. While we are seeing stabilization in near-term pricing, the elevated levels of industry CapEx are a cause for concern and more CapEx cuts are needed to allow for healthy NAND industry profitability. Long-term, we expect a DRAM bit demand growth CAGR of mid to high teens and a NAND bit demand growth CAGR of approximately 30%. Turning to Micron supply, we target our long-term bit supply growth CAGR to be in line with the industry bit demand growth CAGR for both DRAM and NAND. However, there can be year-to-year variability caused by node-transition timing. In both DRAM and NAND, we expect our calendar 2021 bit supply growth to be below the industry demand growth, and we have used our inventory to add to our bit shipment growth this year. We are targeting fiscal 2021 CapEx to be approximately $9 billion to support our long-term goal of maintaining a stable share of industry bit supply. I will now turn it over to Dave.
Dave Zinsner: Thanks Sanjay. Micron delivered very strong fiscal second quarter results, with solid revenue growth, margin expansion, and positive free cash flow. Market conditions improved throughout the quarter, and DRAM and NAND volumes, as well as DRAM pricing, were above our original expectations. Before discussing the details of our fiscal second quarter results, I want to discuss the financial impact of our decision to cease 3D XPoint development and manufacturing. As a result of this decision, we wrote-off $49 million of 3D XPoint inventory in our FQ2 GAAP financial results. This inventory exceeded our needs to fulfill customer commitments. We remain committed to fulfilling our customer commitments to manufacture 3D XPoint wafers and currently expect modest revenues, consistent with recent history until the end of calendar 2021. Our Lehi fab was re-categorized at the end of FQ2 as held for sale on our balance sheet, and beginning in FQ3, depreciation expense for the building and related equipment will stop. As a result, FQ3 gross margins will benefit from approximately $75 million of lower depreciation expense. The remaining costs will continue until the closing of the sale of our 3D XPoint fab in Lehi, Utah. As we discussed on our 3D XPoint update call, Micron will continue to maintain our current R&D investment level and redeploy the 3D XPoint R&D teams to work on technologies and products that align with our vision for memory and storage. We have already made progress on this front since our update call. Now, moving on to our results for the fiscal second quarter. Total FQ2 revenue was approximately $6.24 billion, up 8% quarter-over quarter and up 30% year-over-year. We saw solid growth in most of our end markets, notably in the data center, mobile, PC, auto, and industrial markets.  FQ2 DRAM revenue was $4.4 billion, representing 71% of total revenue. DRAM revenue increased 10% sequentially and was up 44% year-over-year. Bit shipments grew in the high single-digit percentage range sequentially, and ASPs were up slightly quarter-over-quarter. FQ2 NAND revenue was approximately $1.7 billion, representing 26% of total revenue. NAND revenue increased 5% sequentially and was up 9% year-over-year. Bit shipments increased in the high single-digit percentage range sequentially, while ASPs declined in the low single-digit percentage range quarter-over-quarter, showing an improvement in trajectory in the NAND pricing environment. Now, turning to our revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the Compute and Networking Business Unit was approximately $2.6 billion, up approximately 4% sequentially and up 34% year-over-year. Revenue growth was broad-based and driven by a combination of volume and pricing across data center, networking, and client. Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $1.8 billion, up 21% sequentially and up 44% year-over-year. Mobile demand remains strong as 5G momentum increases and the mobile market continues to recover from the impact of the pandemic. Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $850 million, down approximately 7% from the prior quarter and down 2% year-over-year. Both SSD revenue and component revenue declined sequentially. We expect our storage revenue to increase as we introduce our 176-layer client SSDs into volume production. And finally, the Embedded Business Unit generated record revenue of $935 million, which was up 16% sequentially and 34% year-over-year, driven by strong industrial demand and record auto revenue as demand recovered from pandemic-related shutdowns. The consolidated gross margin for FQ2 was 32.9%, up 200 basis points from the prior quarter. DRAM price increases and cost declines drove the margin expansion in FQ2. For fiscal 2021, due to product mix changes, we now expect that our DRAM cost reductions will be somewhat higher than our prior expectations of mid-single-digits, while our NAND cost reductions will be somewhat lower than our prior expectation of low to mid-teens. Operating expenses were $797 million in FQ2. Operating expenses were slightly lower than our expectation as prequal expenses were less than we had anticipated. We continue to expect operating expenses to increase in the second-half of the fiscal year as we incur increased prequalification and labor expenses. As always, we remain committed to tightly managing expenses. FQ2 operating income was $1.3 billion, resulting in an operating margin of 20%, compared to 17% in the prior quarter and 11% in the prior year's quarter. FQ2 EBITDA was $2.8 billion, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 45% compared to 43% in the prior quarter and 40% in the prior year. Net interest expense improved to $24 million, and we expect it to be approximately $25 million in FQ3. Our FQ2 effective tax rate was 10.1%. We expect our tax rate to be in the high single digits for fiscal 2021. Non-GAAP earnings per share in FQ2 were $0.98, up from $0.78 in FQ1 and up from $0.45 in the year-ago quarter. EPS included one cent of non-operating income related to gains from investments in our venture arm, Micron Ventures. Turning to cash flows and capital spending, we generated approximately $3.1 billion in cash from operations in FQ2, representing 49% of revenue. Net capital spending was approximately $2.9 billion during the quarter. Through the first six months of the fiscal year, we have deployed approximately $5.7 billion or slightly less than two-thirds of our expected annual capital spending. As we look ahead to the second-half of the fiscal year, we expect capital spending to decline from the first-half and continue to target approximately $9 billion in total for FY 2021. As a result of our strong cash flow from operations of $3.1 billion, we generated positive free cash flow of $174 million despite the relatively high level of capital spending in the quarter. The increased cash flow was driven by strong revenue growth and efficient working capital management. We expect free cash flow to continue to improve in the second-half of the fiscal year, driven by continued revenue growth, higher margins, and lower capital spending. While we did not have share repurchases in FQ2, we will begin repurchasing shares in the third quarter and remain committed to returning at least 50% of annual free cash flow to shareholders in FY 2021. Ending FQ2 inventory was $4.7 billion or 99 days, which reflects the inventory reporting changes we announced on last quarter's earnings call. We ended the quarter with total cash of $8.6 billion and total liquidity of approximately $11.1 billion. FQ2 ending total debt was $6.6 billion. Now, turning to our outlook. DRAM prices have started to strengthen, and we expect the market to remain undersupplied this calendar year. In addition, NAND conditions are stabilizing. These improving market conditions, combined with our significantly stronger competitive position, set us up to generate stellar financial results in the second-half of the fiscal and calendar year. While demand is strong across both the DRAM and NAND markets, our supply is now constrained as our inventories are very lean, particularly in DRAM. This restricts our ability to serve potential upside to demand. On the cost side, we are facing additional headwinds due to foreign exchange rates and drought mitigation impacting our Taiwan operations and as result our FQ3 DRAM costs could be sequentially up. We are also assuming that there is no impact to our production output due to the Taiwan drought. With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for FQ3 is as follows. We expect revenue to be $7.1 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in the range of 41.5% plus or minus 100 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $875 million, plus or minus $25 million. Finally, based on a share count of approximately 1.16 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $1.62, plus or minus $0.07. In closing, as we reflect on our financial performance for FY 2020, which was a trough year for Micron in this cycle, and compare it to the prior trough in FY 2016, I am amazed by how far we have come. From FY 2016 to FY 2020, we substantially improved our EBITDA margin and our revenue grew by more than 70%. During this time, we delivered average gross margins of 40%, EBITDA margins of 50% and return on invested capital of 20%. We believe Micron's strong performance will continue cross-cycle and outperform the broader semiconductor industry. I will now turn it back to Sanjay.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Dave. None of our achievements are possible without the great work of our world-class Micron team. We seek to recognize and reward team member performance and to do so fairly. Last week, we announced that we achieved comprehensive global pay equity in total employee compensation across base pay, bonuses, and stock rewards for women and all underrepresented groups at Micron. Pay equity is a key pillar of our diversity, equality, and inclusion strategy and core to creating an environment that attracts and retains the best talent. We continue to strengthen Micron's inclusive, values-driven culture, which is an integral part of our broader transformation. We have come a long way since Micron's founding as a startup in Boise, Idaho more than 40 years ago, and today we are a global technology and product leader. As the United States' only remaining memory and storage manufacturer, we welcome the U.S. government's commitments to enhance America's long-term technology leadership and competitiveness in semiconductor manufacturing. This emphasis on our industry, which is reflected by governments globally, is a recognition of the critical role we play in today's digital economy. Memory and storage represent approximately 30% of semiconductor industry revenue today, up from 10% in the early 2000s, and DRAM and NAND are growing in importance as a critical enabler of the most advanced technologies driving economic growth and well-being. Micron's innovation over the decades has created a strong foundation, and we look forward to delivering value for all our stakeholders as the data economy accelerates. Thank you for joining and for your support of Micron. We will now move to Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Evercore. Your line is open.
C.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Sanjay, thank you for taking the question. I guess I was hoping you could compare and contrast what you're seeing this cycle versus previous cycles on the DRAM side? You're talking severe shortages yet, we're really not seeing anyone up-ticking on CapEx. And if you ordered a tool today, you wouldn't get it until Q1 next year at the earliest. So I guess, how are you thinking about things as well as what kind of changes are you seeing in terms of customer behavior and how might that effect your business going forward? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, C.J. And in terms of how we see the demand environment today versus what you refer to a few years ago, no question that at that time, the demand was driven with the increases in cloud primarily and today the demand drivers are much more diverse. We are seeing shortages across all end markets. The demand is strong across all end markets. When you look at cloud, while cloud may have gone through some digestion over the course of last couple of quarters. When we look ahead, cloud demand is expected to be healthy, given the refresh with the new CPUs that are driving greater content in the servers. Similarly, mobile with 5G is driving much greater content, a first 5G phone and on a year-over-year basis, the number of smartphones being sold are expected to increase on a double-digit basis as well. So, a strong driver of growth on mobile phones as well. Automotive experienced, of course, big decline last year. But on a year-over-year basis, a mid-double-digit range growth in automotive number of units sold. So, automotive is also driving greater content increase as well as unit increases. So, overall, the industry is experiencing strong demand virtually across all end market segments. The CapEx has been disciplined, particularly in DRAM over the course of last couple of years and the environment is one of severe under supply. So, we are very excited about the opportunities ahead. And we absolutely believe that Micron in this environment in terms of demand and supply considerations and our own execution from a technology point of view, having industry's leading edge, 1-alpha node industries first as well as having industries first 176-layer node, we are well-positioned to drive our growth ahead and really well-positioned to deliver stellar financial results over the course of next several quarters. And in terms of our customers, a question that you asked as well. I mean, customers across the board are seeing that memory DRAM is in short supply and that does affect some of the lead-times that we expect from those customers and by and large, those customers are supportive of those lead-time considerations. And in this environment of extremely tight supply, the flexibility that is available for customers to switch between products is also becoming more limited. And this then does require customers to have longer lead-times as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Pitzer: Yes. Sanjay, Dave, thanks to let me ask questions. Congratulations on strong results. Sanjay, just sticking on the CapEx side, you're characterizing the DRAM market as a severe shortage, the NAND market is stabilizing, which is sort of an uptick of how you've been characterized in the market over the last couple of quarters. You're under growing industry bids and you've got sort of an industry-leading cost position, especially in DRAM with 1-alpha. And yet when I look at your full-year CapEx versus what you've spent fiscal year-to-date, you're going to be down over 40% in the second-half of the year. Why not get a little bit more aggressive on CapEx? What would you need to see? And at these levels, can you maintain your goal of being in line with industry bit share at these CapEx levels?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, I think it is important to understand that we do remain disciplined with respect to CapEx. We want to make sure we manage it prudently. Our goal is that over longer-term in terms of supply growth CAGR to be aligned with the industry demand growth CAGR. And we have made prudent decisions over the course of last few years in terms of CapEx investment. If you look at our fiscal year 2021 CapEx of approximately $9 billion, this is really almost the highest CapEx that the company has spent in its history and we are putting that into positioning us well for the future in terms of, of course, creating more cleanroom expansion, but also investing in leading edge technologies, which is what as we look ahead will drive our supply growth with our 1-alpha node in DRAM as well as with our 176-layer NAND node. So, even last year, while the industry was going through a trough period, Micron actually took the steps to invest for building for the future strength of the company. So, all in all, we believe that our bit share in the industry would stay stable. And overall, it is a good environment for us to operate in, where our demand growth and our supply growth are on a CAGR base is aligned, yes, from quarter-to-quarter there can be variations, but most important thing is that long-term supply growth CAGR is managed in a disciplined fashion. And this is what is Micron's focus and we believe we are well-positioned. As I said before, well-positioned to deliver stellar results over the course of next several quarters.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri of UBS. Your line is open.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I guess I also had a question on CapEx. Dave, given what you're guiding the back half of the year to, you're going to basically be exiting the year like annualizing roughly $6 billion in CapEx, something like that. So, it requires a pretty big ramp, just to get to that like 30% capital intensity number for next year that you've been kind of talking about. So, is that still the right number to think about that you can get to like low 30s capital intensity for fiscal 2022? Because there's just not a lot of slots that you can get right now, even if you decide that you want to spend more money, those tool shipments slots aren't even really free until start of next year or so? Thanks.
Dave Zinsner: All right. Yes, I mean, keep in mind that CapEx can be a little lumpy. There are times where we need to make the investments ahead of our node transitions and though sometimes can get more consolidated into a couple of quarters. And I think that's essentially what you're seeing in fiscal 2021. We're not ready to talk to numbers of our fiscal 2022 yet. We haven't finished fiscal 2021 and we need to do that before we kind of formulate the plan. But I would tell you, over the long-term, we feel very comfortable with our target CapEx spend of low 30s or 30% to 35% of our revenue in terms of CapEx. As Sanjay talked about, we take a very long-term view of CapEx and align that CapEx investment to make sure that supply and demand are in balance for us and we'll continue to do – to approach it that way.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your question please.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you. If I look at the sort of quarter-on-quarter bit growth for DRAM, you've given the last four quarters, I get to 40% plus type growth in February versus supply that you're sort of talking about less than 20% I think. So, obviously, there is some deceleration implied there that you unwound inventory a little bit in February. I know you talked about that a little bit after the pre-announcement, but maybe just give us a little bit of color on how you got to that bit growth and how that affects the next couple of quarters?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, of course, if you look at last year, we had said that our supply growth was somewhat greater last year compared to the industry supply growth and the industry demand growth as well. So that positioned us well in terms of using our power inventory this year. And our supply growth this year is expected to be less than the industry demand growth. Industry demand growth we have just raised our estimations to approximately 20% in calendar year 2021. So, our supply growth to be somewhat less than the industry and of course, we have used up in DRAM our inventory to supply -- to meet the growing customer requirements. As we look ahead, it will be -- our supply growth will be driven by our 1-alpha technology in DRAM. We will be ramping it over the course of next few quarters. It will be the workhorse of technology for us in terms of bit growth in fiscal 2022 as well. And, of course, as we bring out our products in this technology node, we have to get them qualified with our customers and that's what we are focused on in terms of getting the ramp up of this technology, 1-alpha technology getting products qualified in time for it to position us to drive our supply bit growth to meet the ultimate customer demand growth requirements during the rest of the calendar year.
Joe Moore: Okay that makes sense, but I am I right in thinking that there is an implied kind of decline in kind of sequential bits as you moved a lot of inventory in February, you don't have that inventory to move in May?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, again, our inventory in DRAM is really very lean at this point, and going forward, the growth will come from our 1-alpha node. And I think what's again important is that there can be fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter, but long-term, it is really about having a stable market share driven by technology transitions, which is our focus and which we have delivered successfully, whether you look at our 1z node in DRAM, that was the first 1z node in the industry, now 1-alpha node is the first -- 1-alpha node in the industry as well. So, technology transitions is what we are focused in terms of driving our long-term demand -- supply bit growth CAGR to be in line with the demand growth CAGR. And from quarter-to-quarter depending upon the timing of the technology transitions, there can be fluctuations. Second-half in terms of our year-over-year growth will be lower than the first-half. Yes.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Danely of Citi. Your line is open.
Chris Danely: Hey. Thanks guys. Just a bit of a longer-term question. So, Sanjay/Dave, if things continue to be strong for hopefully several quarters like you guys are talking about your cash pile is going to go fairly substantially. So, theoretically speaking for sitting here a year, year and a half out, what are you thinking about as far as the usage of that cash going forward? And could we see a dividend potentially in the future?
Dave Zinsner: Yes, well, so our current obviously approach towards returning cash to shareholders is through the buyback. We mentioned in the second fiscal quarter, we didn't buy back stock nor did we buy back stock in the first quarter and that was really a function of the fact that cash flow was negative and we were protecting our cash -- our net cash position. But as you say -- suggest and as we talked about we do expect to have good cash flow in the back half of the fiscal year and we do expect this business to generate good free cash flow over time. So, I think primarily, you can look to us to buy back stock. We're going to return at least 50% of our free cash flow in the form of buybacks and we have in the past returned more than that. So, potentially, we could do that in the future. There is a few things on the balance sheet as it relates to converts and debt that might use some of that cash as well. As far as the dividend, we haven't talked with the Board about that. Certainly, a possibility, but I think we need to get through this year and discuss with the Board if that makes sense.
Chris Danely: Great. Thanks guys.
Dave Zinsner: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Toshiya Hari: Great. Thank you for taking the question. Dave you're guiding gross margin up about 900 basis points sequentially for the May quarter. You talked about the exit from 3D XPoint driving lower depreciation. I think it was $75 million. You also talked about DRAM costs potentially being up due to FX and the drought in Taiwan. But outside of those two items, how are you thinking about costs in your NAND business given the transition to second gen replacement gate and what are your thoughts on pricing for both DRAM and NAND? I think for DRAM, most of us are expecting 10%, 15% pricing increases. On the NAND side perhaps up low single-digits, but how are you guys thinking about pricing and how are you thinking about sustainability of pricing into the second-half? Thank you.
Dave Zinsner: Okay. Thanks. So, as you point out, we do get the $75 million tailwind in the third fiscal quarter due to the stoppage of the depreciation expense in Lehi that certainly will be beneficial and will help the following quarter. It actually may be a little bit better than that. And so that will be a tailwind again for the fourth fiscal quarter. We talked about DRAM costs. We are affected by a few things. I mentioned the drought mitigation that is causing a little bit of a headwind on our costs on DRAM. We are -- because of the significant tightness in our supply chain, we are seeing some increased spending as it relates to the back end. So, that's certainly a factor as well. And also as I mentioned in the prepared remarks FX has been a bit of a headwind for us in particular to Taiwan dollar which was ahead about a 5% appreciation this year. So, those things are driving a little bit of a cost increase. I would say that's probably kind of a one or two quarter type effect. We're pretty excited about the 1-alpha node. It does have a great cost structure. It will be a workhorse node for us in fiscal 2022 and so we would expect that to certainly help on the cost side on DRAM. On the NAND front, we are expecting cost to improve next quarter, aligned with our kind of annual cost reduction assumptions, which suggests it will be in the low double-digits year-over-year. So, that will certainly be a little bit of a benefit on the gross margins as well. The rest of the gross margin guidance is obviously a function of assumptions around pricing and mix and we avoid specifics around that. Suffice it to say that we feel very good about the pricing environment in DRAM, given the very tight supply situation we're in, in DRAM. And we're cautiously optimistic on the NAND front given the stabilization we've seen more recently. But outside of that, I prefer not to comment more on the pricing side.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. And great job on the quarter's execution. Just given the DRAM tightness and what appears to be tightness in literally all of your end markets, is the team you allocating your production mix, let's say from mobile towards more higher growth, higher margin segments of the market like enterprise and cloud and gaming as you move towards the second-half of the year, especially on your view of strong cloud demand in the second-half, improving enterprise trends, improving gaming trends in the second-half of the year. Is there any reallocation on the product mix in terms of wafers that you guys are starting today?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, remember the lead-time, the cycle-time of wafers in the fab tends to be in the two to three months range and the wafers that you start today by the time they are shipping to the customers that time ends up being, including the time for assembly and test ends up being three to four months later. So, in this environment of really tightness across all end market segments, planning our wafer starts and dedicating them toward various end markets is really critically important. So, this is the kind of activity that our team is always engaged in, in terms of working closely with customers and understanding their demand mix. So, not just total bit demand, but the bit mix of that demand between various product types, because it's extremely important that we start our wafers in line with the expectation of our customers demand few months down the road, given again the cycle-time considerations. So, we are always managing this mix, but again, we would point out that we are seeing supply shortages for us across all end market segments and across all nodes of DRAM as well. And in this environment, we -- this is why, as I mentioned earlier, the lead-time that customers is important and it is an environment where flexibility in terms of, for customers to switch between one product type to another product type is more limited now. When we had more inventory in DRAM before, that was easier to manage, now that the inventory is running at these lean levels, managing our supply mix, keeping it in line with the customer mix, this is an ongoing activity here at Micron and our team has done I think a great job. Our supply chain team, our business units and our sales teams have done a great job working with our customers, understanding the market requirements, and managing our business well. And you see the result in terms of how well we have been able to bring inventory both in DRAM as well as in NAND. And of course, we are continuing to push for SSDs and multi-chip packages toward our higher density solutions as well, because again, all those considerations are important in this environment of tight supply and the tightness in terms of supply-only increasing as we go through the year. So, this is getting a lot of focus Harlan.
Harlan Sur: All right. Thanks for the insight Sanjay.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Aaron Rakers: Yes, thanks for taking the question and also congratulations on the strong execution. I wanted to ask you a little bit about the longer term secular growth drivers in the server DRAM market. How do you see kind of content growth on a per server basis progressing? And I know you've talked about CXL, what's the thoughts on what CXL means to that equation and when that starts to matter? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: And so in terms of server content, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks with the new compute platform architectures and the processor that are being introduced, they are all leading toward more cores, more channels and greater usage of higher density modules. And of course, the end market applications when you look at, those workloads are becoming more and more data intensive, more AI-driven and ultimately driving for greater need for data and greater attach rate and greater content on a per server basis. So, enterprise and cloud combined, really when you look at CAGR in terms of demand growth, expected to be a stronger CAGR in terms of big demand growth versus the average of the market. So, this is definitely one of high growth areas. And the average content growth continues to be very strong and at a strong clip in terms of gigabytes per CPU, when you look at it for DRAM that is more like in -- on a CAGR base is more like 20% average capacity growing on a per server basis, growing from something like 200-gigabyte per CPU to growing to 300-gigabyte per CPU over the course of next two to three years. So, DRAM has strong growth and of course, same for SSD as well in terms of cost of ownership benefits that SSDs provide as well. And CXL is a new emerging trend. And this will create a greater opportunity for differentiated solutions. And as we mentioned earlier, that these are opportunities that we believe we'll be very well-positioned to capture with our emerging technology solutions that we are working on which we believe will provide higher ROI as well as high-performance solutions for our customers. So, CXL is again a development where Micron will be well-positioned to really address the memory hierarchy needs of our customers as they evolve over the course of next few years.
Aaron Rakers: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Your question, please.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Just couple of follow-ups for me. I'm going to go back to inventory. Obviously, your commentary about the supply and demand environment suggest that prices are on the rise, but perhaps you want to lean your inventory or you want to continue to reduce because that inventory is now really fungible for new application that you're going to be shipping to in the second-half. Is that the right way to think about this?
Dave Zinsner: As it relates to our inventory, it's pretty lean at this point. I mean all the inventory that you're seeing is either WIP or raw materials. There is a bit of finished goods, but it's just the amount of finished goods we need to stage to meet the customer demand. So, I think we're not in a position to lean it out anymore. We are quite lean at this point.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay, got it. So, there is no fungibility question. And then just moving on to NAND and Sanjay, I see the same demand dynamics that are making you very bullish on DRAM also applied to NAND as matter of fact CXL could be a material catalyst for NAND. What is it with your underlying assumption that is still keeping your long-term NAND bit growth to 30%. There is a ton of data created and some of these architectural changes could actually be good for storage especially SSD. And I'm just curious why you're not as upbeat as end market data point would suggest?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, the long-term CAGR for DRAM we have said is approximately 30% and of course, this is something that we constantly evaluate with working with our customers and we do analyze this and as and when needed we update these, but at this point our estimation for long-term DRAM CAGR is approximately 30%. I would like to point out that overall when you look at the price elasticity trends in DRAM and certainly when you look at post pandemic growth and as I mentioned earlier, the cost of ownership benefit for DRAM -- for NAND in the data center market and of course, 5G driving greater content growth with respect to future rich -- increasingly feature rich smartphones as well. So, the demand trends for NAND are robust and I think the important thing to really monitor is the supply to be managed in alignment with the demand expectations and this is where, as we have said before, that industry CapEx can be managed better in terms of supply growth aligned with longer term demand considerations. And I may have misspoken here; I may have said that approximately 30% in terms of the CAGR for demand growth. I may have said DRAM in that context, of course, I was speaking about NAND. So, I just want to correct myself that the 30% demand growth CAGR that I referred to is for NAND. Of course, as we have said for DRAM, the long-term demand growth CAGR we see in high-teens, mid to high teens.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thank you. Clear. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom O'Malley of Barclays. Your line is open.
Tom O'Malley: Good afternoon Sanjay and Dave. And thanks for taking my question. This one is more related to Dave. You talked about DRAM costs in the May quarter potentially being up because of a couple of factors, but you also took the full year guide for costs and so that there could be a bit better. Is that a comment on August cost accelerating and being better there? Or can you just walk me through the dynamics of how you're seeing cost up in May and then the full year a little bit better in terms of overall costs?
Dave Zinsner: First of all, good question Tom. So, really we saw much better cost in the second fiscal quarter for DRAM. And that really was the trigger to get the overall full-year cost to be higher. Now, that was more a function of mix than you think, but that is what drove kind of the upside on the cost side. Did I say higher, yes, sorry, I meant lower, yes, costs look to be lower -- I meant the higher number, that's what I meant. The May quarter -- or the August quarter then is, we're not yet ready to provide some expectation, but I think the likelihood is that it wouldn't be -- it certainly shouldn't be a step up in terms of sequential cost and likely will be slightly down.
Tom O'Malley: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava of BMO. Your line is open.
Ambrish Srivastava: Hi, thank you for squeezing me in. Sanjay, I had a question on the shortages and then how are you reacting to -- and you talked a little bit about the difficulty in planning and allocating wafers. So, some of the semi companies -- we are hearing companies, they've talked about changing the order cancellation policy from 45 days to 90 days and some companies talking about absolutely no cancellations out. So, how are -- are your long-term -- are your arrangements changing with some of the key customers as a result of this, so that it enables Micron to plan better. Can you just help us provide your perspective on how Micron is dealing with that?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Certainly working very closely with our customers and customers across all our end markets. As I mentioned earlier, certainly lead-times with our customers in terms of supply. Commitments are increasing. The flexibility, I think our customers by and large understand that the flexibility in terms of mixing of their bit demand is getting more limited as well given that not only our supply is in very tight situation, but overall the industry -- the semiconductor industry with respect to materials and capacity is also in a tight position. And our supply chain team has done an excellent job over the course of last year in terms of really procuring materials and capacity early on, so that even though we are running tight, we are able to meet our customer requirements, but yes, with less flexibility than before. And as Dave mentioned earlier that some of this procurement of capacity does put some cost pressures in terms of our second-half outlook as well and so of course, for FQ3, that's baked into our guidance. So, our customers understand that this is an environment where we need to work closely with them and overall our teams are doing a very good job in managing this environment of tight supply. And we see this close collaboration that is going to be needed as we go through this year and as we go into 2022 as well, because really we are confident in 2022 demand as well. As the world recovers from this pandemic, technology -- the economies across the globe are expected to be in a strong growth mode and of course technology demand will increase and vaccinations are happening here in the U.S. first, rest of the globe coming in during the latter part of the year. So, the growth will be in 2021 as well as 2022 and we feel good about our outlook in terms of demand drivers even in 2022 timeframe. So, this working closely with customers to help manage the mix of their products and their supply requirements is going to be an important consideration, not just for next quarter or two, I believe well into 2022 timeframe as well.
Ambrish Srivastava: Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: And this is a great position for us to be in, in terms of, particularly when you look at how we remain focused on our technology and product leadership execution. First with 1-alpha node in DRAM as well as first with 176-layer NAND and remaining focus on bringing those technology nodes into production and customer qualifications over the course of next several quarters.
Ambrish Srivastava: Thank you, Sanjay.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Farhan. Good afternoon and happy new year, everyone. Micron delivered strong revenue and earnings in the fiscal first quarter. I am proud of the Micron team for continuing our business momentum and putting Micron in a better technology and product position than ever before despite the ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic. We began shipping the industry’s most advanced NAND with 176 layers. And in DRAM, we made good progress on our 1-alpha node and are on track to begin volume production in the first half of calendar 2021. We believe DRAM is past the bottom of the industry cycle and expect improving trends through calendar 2021 as the digitization of the global economy continues, fueled by artificial intelligence, cloud, 5G and the intelligent edge, including smart vehicles. Against this backdrop, Micron is poised to emerge stronger and we are excited about our future. I will start with a quick update on our manufacturing operations. In early December, two separate events affected our Taiwan DRAM operations. The first event was a power outage at our Taoyuan facility, which occurred on December 3rd, the last day of our fiscal first quarter. The second event, a 6.7-magnitude earthquake off the northeast coast of Taiwan occurred on December 10th. The earthquake was felt at both our Taoyuan and Taichung locations. The investments we have made over the last few years in facilities’ redundancy and cleanroom control substantially mitigated the impact of these two events. However, these disruptions have reduced our available fiscal second quarter DRAM supply and negatively influenced our costs in the short term. The expected impact of these events is factored into our outlook.  Micron continues to make solid progress on our key goals; first, to deliver industry leading technology and improve our cost structure; second, to bring differentiated products to market and improve our product mix; and third, to grow our share of industry profits while maintaining stable bit share. From fiscal year '16 to fiscal year '20, we substantially improved our EBITDA margin for our combined DRAM and NAND business, while the rest of the industry in aggregate was roughly flat. And over the last few years, we have accelerated our technology roadmap in both DRAM and NAND. As a result, for the first time in our history, Micron has technology leadership in both DRAM and NAND simultaneously. Now that we are leading the industry in technology capability, going forward, we expect to maintain this competitive position through a more typical cadence for node transitions consistent with the rest of the industry. In DRAM, we are making good progress on our 1-alpha node. This will be an outstanding technology node for Micron, delivering a 40% improvement in bits per wafer over our 1z. A substantial portion of this improvement comes from our chip design concepts that provide greater memory array efficiency. Following the extraordinary improvements of our 1-alpha node, we anticipate lower gains in bits-per-wafer growth as more complex interfaces such as DDR5 are introduced and as DRAM technology scaling challenges continue. We are also making progress with differentiated DRAM products such as GDDR6 and 6X for graphics. In the fiscal first quarter, we saw strong growth in bit shipments for these products. We also began revenue shipments of HBM2E products. In NAND, in early November, we began volume production of our second generation replacement-gate node, which is the most advanced in the industry, combining our replacement-gate architecture, CMOS under the array and advanced charge-trap process technology. It also features double the power efficiency and write performance of Micron’s 96-layer 3D NAND. These improvements are essential for addressing future high-end mobile applications. We began shipping 176-layer consumer SSDs in the fiscal first quarter and will be introducing products built with this technology across the rest of our product portfolio over the course of next several months. We are also driving product innovations and cost reductions through an increased mix of QLC NAND, and we are leading the industry with the broadest portfolio of QLC SSDs across client, consumer and data center markets. QLC helps to make SSDs more cost-effective and accelerates the replacement of HDDs with SSDs. QLC SSD adoption continues to grow and our bit mix of QLC SSDs increased further in FQ1. Turning to end markets. In data center, cloud and AI will drive long-term growth with memory and storage becoming an increasing portion of server BOM cost. New compute architectures are enabling more memory channels and higher density modules, contributing to increases in server memory content. Micron is positioned for success in this market with a broad portfolio of high-bandwidth, high-quality and power-efficient products. Cloud and enterprise DRAM revenue declined sequentially from a very strong 14-week FQ4, with ongoing enterprise market weakness. In FQ1, we began revenue shipments for our ultra-bandwidth HBM2E memory, which is used for data center, AI training and inference. We are making progress on the DDR5 transition, which will double bandwidth and reduce power consumption, and we plan to start that transition in the second half of fiscal 2021. In data center SSDs, we continue to make progress on our NVMe portfolio and completed several customer qualifications in FQ1. We also continue to maintain our leadership position in SATA. Data center SSD revenue declined sequentially but was up year-over-year as cloud growth offset a decline in enterprise. We remain focused on strengthening our data center NVMe SSD roadmap with internally developed controllers and have new product introductions planned in the coming quarters. Our FQ1 mobile revenue was up sequentially, driven by solid execution and improved handset demand. A better-than-expected transition of Micron’s mobile business from Huawei to other mobile customers also contributed to our revenue upside in FQ1. Micron is well positioned to win in the 5G era with our industry-leading product portfolio. We had several key achievements in our mobile business in FQ1. We maintained LP5 solutions leadership and grew our LP5 shipments, were the first to market with uMCP5 and achieved record MCP revenue. In PC, the continued remote work and learning trend drove strong notebook and Chromebook demand in the quarter, despite pockets of nonmemory component shortages in the supply chain. We delivered strong sequential growth in PC DRAM shipments driven by this demand. In client SSD, NVMe represented over 90% of the client SSD bits, with nearly half of those NVMe SSD bits being QLC. Consumer SSDs had a second consecutive record quarter for bit shipments, and we shipped the world’s first 176-layer-based consumer SSDs. In graphics, we achieved strong GDDR6 and 6X bit shipment growth, driven by new game console and PC graphics product launches. Micron has a strong position in this high-growth market, with a broad product portfolio and deep customer partnerships. We had a record auto revenue quarter, resulting from the resumption of auto manufacturing around the globe and the continued growth of memory and storage content per vehicle. We also achieved qualification of our 1z LP4 DRAM and began sampling our 96-layer-based UFS NAND. Electric vehicles have higher semiconductor content and as EVs continue to proliferate, we expect our auto business to continue to excel. In addition, as autonomous driving features advance, this content growth trend will accelerate further. Micron’s quality and market share leadership uniquely positions us to not just benefit from this growth, but also to drive innovative solutions for next-generation vehicles in collaboration with our ecosystem of customers and industry partners. Now turning to our view of calendar 2020 industry demand. During FQ1, overall demand was strong across most end markets despite shortages of nonmemory components in PC, mobile, auto and graphics. Cloud demand was healthy while enterprise demand was weak due to the economic environment. As a result of the stronger-than-expected demand at the end of the year, we now estimate that calendar 2020 industry DRAM bits demand growth was slightly above 20%, while NAND bit demand growth was in the mid-20s. Now for our calendar 2021 outlook. In DRAM, we are past the bottom and the industry is in tight supply across major market segments. As a result, we are already seeing our calendar Q1 pricing starting to increase in several parts of the market. 16 gigabyte adoption in client in data center modules has increased, causing the same supply tightness that was previously seen in 8 gigabyte, to also now be visible in 16 gigabyte. We expect calendar 2021 DRAM industry bit demand growth of high teens, with DRAM industry supply to be below demand. Stronger-than-expected industry demand has reduced supplier DRAM inventories. Low inventories, combined with disciplined industry CapEx in 2020 and the vaccine-driven recovery from the pandemic, should result in further tightening of the DRAM market through calendar 2021. In addition, we will also benefit from higher content in 5G phones, which are forecast to double in unit sales in 2021 to around 500 million units. We anticipate healthy unit growth in the PC market, and graphics should continue to benefit from new gaming consoles and from new gaming cards launched in the second half of last year. We expect the cloud market to grow at a healthy pace and enterprise market recovery will be driven by the timing of the broader economic recovery. Calendar 2021 industry NAND bit demand growth is expected to be approximately 30%, with supply potentially higher. The NAND market is challenging in the near-term. However, we believe that as the year progresses, elasticity coupled with pandemic recovery should lead to improving demand. We believe the market can stabilize over the course of 2021 if suppliers moderate their production growth. Long-term, we expect DRAM bit demand growth CAGR of mid to high-teens and a NAND bit demand growth CAGR of approximately 30%. Turning to Micron supply. We target our long-term bit supply growth CAGR to be in line with industry bit demand growth CAGR for both DRAM and NAND. However, there can be year-to-year variability caused by node-transition timing. In both DRAM and NAND, we expect our calendar 2021 bit supply growth to be below the industry demand growth, and we plan to use inventory to support bit shipment growth that is in line with industry demand growth. For fiscal 2021, we expect DRAM cost reductions in the mid-single-digit percent range with somewhat higher levels of cost reductions on a like-for-like basis. We anticipate NAND cost reductions in the low-to-mid-teens percentage range. We are targeting fiscal 2021 CapEx to be approximately $9 billion to support our long-term goal of maintaining a stable share of industry bit supply. If demand expectations change, we remain flexible to adjust our CapEx. As we look ahead, we are excited about the growth and health of our diverse end markets, which continue to benefit from powerful secular technology trends, including AI, cloud, 5G and the intelligent edge. These trends are already enabling the data economy and increasing the importance of DRAM and NAND. Memory and storage industry revenues have grown faster than the broader semiconductor industry from approximately 10% of semiconductor industry revenues in the early 2000s to now approaching 30%. We expect that our TAM growth will continue to outpace the rest of the semiconductor industry over the next decade. Micron's focus on technology and product leadership, operational excellence and deep customer partnerships positions us well to grow our relevance and profit share in the industry. I'll now turn it over to Dave to provide our financial results and guidance.
Dave Zinsner: Thanks Sanjay. Micron delivered very strong fiscal first quarter results with revenues and earnings coming in well above the guidance ranges provided in our last earnings call. We saw an improving business environment through the quarter, and demand and pricing were better than expected for both DRAM and NAND. Total FQ1 revenue was approximately $5.8 billion, down 5% quarter-over-quarter but up 12% year-over-year. Adjusting for the extra week in the prior quarter, revenue increased 3% sequentially, driven by strength in a broad set of markets, including auto, graphics, client, mobile and consumer. FQ1 DRAM revenue was $4.1 billion, representing 70% of total revenue. DRAM revenue decreased 7% sequentially but was up 17% year-over year. Bit shipments were down in the low single-digit percentage range sequentially and ASPs were down in the mid-single-digit percentage range quarter-over-quarter. FQ1 NAND revenue was approximately $1.6 billion, representing 27% of total revenue. NAND revenue increased 3% sequentially and was up 11% year-over-year. Bit shipments increased in the high-teens percentage range sequentially, while ASPs declined in the low-teens percentage range quarter-over-quarter. Half of the decline was attributable to a change in mix, which included a greater portion of components. Now turning to our revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the Compute and Networking Business Unit was approximately $2.5 billion, down approximately 16% sequentially but up 29% year-over-year. We had solid sequential growth in graphics and client revenues, while data center revenues declined sequentially, coming off a particularly strong quarter for cloud, the loss of the extra week and continued weakness in enterprise. Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $1.5 billion, up 3% sequentially and up 3% year-over-year. Mobile demand remains strong as 5G momentum increases and the mobile market recovers from the impact of the pandemic. Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $911 million, roughly flat from the prior quarter and down 6% year-over-year. As a reminder, 3D XPoint revenues are now reported in the Compute and Networking Business Unit. Excluding 3D XPoint from the prior year’s quarter, SBU revenues would be up 14% year-over-year. Finally, revenue for the Embedded Business Unit was $809 million, up 24% sequentially and up 10% year-over-year. EBU revenue was the highest since Q1 fiscal '19, driven by a record auto revenue as demand recovered from pandemic-related shutdowns. The consolidated gross margin for FQ1 was 30.9%, down 400 basis points from the prior quarter. Our gross margin was impacted by pricing declines and a greater mix of NAND. Operating expenses were $811 million in FQ1 as we continued to tightly manage expenses. We are expecting to increase operating expenses in the second half of this fiscal year as the previously delayed fiscal '21 salary increases take effect at the beginning of FQ3 and we incur additional prequalification related expenses in FQ3 and FQ4. As a result, we anticipate that FQ3 expenses will increase approximately 10% sequentially from FQ2, but of course we remain flexible to reduce operating expenses from those levels should business conditions warrant. FQ1 operating income was $973 million, resulting in an operating margin of 17% compared to 21% in the prior quarter and 12% in the prior year’s quarter. Net interest expense was flat quarter-over-quarter at $31 million. We expect the net interest expense to be approximately $35 million in FQ2. Our FQ1 effective tax rate was 7.4%. We expect our tax rate to be in the mid to high single digits for the remainder of fiscal '21. Non-GAAP earnings per share in FQ1 were $0.78, down from $1.08 in FQ4 and up from $0.48 in the year ago quarter. EPS included $0.02 of nonoperating income related to gains from investments in our venture arm, Micron Ventures. Turning to cash flows and capital spending. We generated approximately $2 billion in cash from operations in FQ1, representing 34% of revenue. Net capital spending was approximately $2.8 billion during the quarter. We expect approximately $9 billion in capital spending for fiscal '21 with spending weighted towards the first half of the fiscal year. Free cash flow in the quarter was negative $816 million. We expect free cash flow to remain negative in FQ2 but to improve from the FQ1 level, driven by increased cash flow from operations. As we said previously, we expect to generate healthy free cash flow during the second half of fiscal '21. Although we didn’t repurchase shares in FQ1, we remain committed to returning greater than 50% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases. We made a significant improvement on our days of inventory and ended FQ1 with $5.5 billion of inventory or 125 days versus 135 days last quarter. As we look ahead to FQ2, I want to share some changes to our upcoming inventory reporting. Starting in FQ2, we will be using a FIFO or first-in first-out approach to inventory valuation as opposed to the average cost method that we have historically used. Concurrently, we are introducing a new costing methodology that uses standard costing. These changes will help us improve our business reporting by valuing inventory at the most recent production costs and aligning with general semiconductor industry practices. While we expect no material impact to our non-GAAP results from these changes, we do expect to record a onetime non-cash charge of approximately $300 million, which will impact our FQ2 GAAP results and reduce the carrying value of our inventory. Unlike certain valuation adjustments or write-downs to inventory, this is a permanent methodology change that will not result in a material impact to our future costs or margins. Concurrently with these changes, we will also reclassify spare parts from inventory to other current assets, which also better aligns with the rest of the industry. This new representation will reduce our inventory balance and consequently, our days of inventory will decline by approximately 10 days versus the old methodology. Applying this 10-day decline, our FQ1 days of inventory would have been approximately 115 days, and our new days of inventory target is approximately 95 to 105 days. We expect to reach our days of inventory target in the second half of fiscal '21. We ended the quarter with total cash of $8.4 billion and total liquidity of approximately $10.9 billion. FQ1 ending total debt was $6.6 billion. Now turning to our outlook. We gave seen improving conditions across multiple DRAM end markets with strong demand in cloud, client, auto and mobile. This demand recovery would be even stronger if it weren’t for the shortages of nonmemory components in several markets. On the supply side, as Sanjay mentioned, a power outage and an earthquake have limited our DRAM supply, and we are rapidly drawing down on our inventory across DRAM and NAND. From a gross margin perspective, the power outage and earthquake impact will be a headwind to our DRAM cost reductions in FQ2. Additionally, the timing of new DRAM and NAND node ramps also limits our cost reductions for FQ2. With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for FQ1 is as follows: We expect revenue to be $5.8 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in the range of 31%, plus or minus 100 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $825 million, plus or minus $25 million. Finally, based on a share count of approximately 1.15 billion fully diluted shares, we expect earnings per share to be $0.75, plus or minus $0.07. As we look beyond FQ2, we anticipate that a vaccine-driven economic recovery combined with secular trends such as 5G adoption and AI will result in stronger demand. In the second half of FY21, we expect improved financial performance, driven by strengthening market conditions and a stronger cost reduction across DRAM and NAND. In closing, we’re confident in Micron’s ability to deliver strong long term revenue growth and cross-cycle profitability. Over the last four years, Micron has delivered average gross margins of 40%, EBITDA margins of 50% and return on invested capital of 20%. We believe Micron’s strong performance will continue cross cycle. As we look to the expected upturn in the DRAM business in calendar 2021, Micron’s relentless focus on execution positions us well to generate solid returns for our shareholders. I’ll now turn the call over to Sanjay for closing remarks.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Dave. Over the last year, Micron delivered strong performance in the face of significant challenges from COVID. I am thankful to the Micron team whose tenacity and resilience enabled us to navigate this challenging period and maintain production at normal levels while continuing to advance our technology and product portfolio. Micron is poised to emerge stronger in calendar 2021 as the world recovers from the pandemic. We are confident in our roadmap to further enhance our competitive position while exercising supply discipline. We are in a better position than ever before, and this has been recognized by our customers. Recently, Micron received supplier awards from multiple customers, including from tier 1 China smartphone OEMs. We also continue to make great strides in advancing our corporate responsibility agenda. In November, Micron published our fiscal year annual diversity, equality and inclusion report, detailing our progress over the year and our commitments for fiscal year 21. In 2020, we increased our female board representation and also made investments to improve representation of all underrepresented groups, including Blacks and Latinx in technical and leadership roles. We expanded our pay equity initiative beyond gender to also include other underrepresented groups and to consider total compensation across pay and equity awards. We are working with industry organizations to establish best practices in supplier diversity and to support the inclusion and competitiveness of diverse suppliers in the semiconductor industry. And finally, we leveraged the power of Micron's influence in the communities where we live and work to advocate for greater social justice and safety globally. We are also proud to report that in November, we were added to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, joining the ranks of the most sustainable American companies. We aim to build on this recognition as we advance on our sustainability goals this year. Thank you. And now we will open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citigroup.
Chris Danely: In terms of what's impacting you, I guess you can sort of control or fix the power outage and the earthquake, but you also mentioned that there's shortages of nonmemory components out there that are impacting you as well or impacting the memory industry. Can you maybe quantify those and is that issue getting any better or could it get any worse? And could this I guess hinder any sort of upturn in DRAM this year?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So let me be clear that when we're referring to nonmemory component shortages, we were referring to those and our end markets, our customers experiencing certain end market shortages. And yes, without those nonmemory component shortages, yes, the overall demand could have been even somewhat higher. And these nonmemory component shortages that some of our customers are experiencing, they relate to general tightness in the foundry space, logic, 8 inch, 12 inch nodes, there's some of our customers and there is end market hardware are experiencing certain shortages, so that's what we are referring to. Of course with respect to our [old] [ph] supply chain, this is an area given some of the foundry shortages that are existing today, we are continuing to manage our supply chain today. We do not see for this quarter any specific shortages in terms of our ability to supply any nonmemory shortages with respect to our ability to supply product to our customers. Of course as we highlighted in our script, we do see certain shortages in memory, particularly in DRAM across several parts of the market. And with respect to our [whole] [ph] supply chain aspect, we have factored those in the outlook that we have provided. And the supply chain has really excellent operations team and we continue to work with our suppliers, with our partners to make the best assessment in terms of managing our own supply chain. So again, to be clear, we were not pointing to any nonmemory component shortages in this quarter for our own manufacturing supply chain, we were referring more to our customers’ end markets where they're experiencing certain nonmemory component shortages. Of course from the point of view of our own supply chain, we continue to monitor some of the trends that are there in the tech supply chain, there's certain parts of the supply chains running tight, we continue to monitor those in terms of any impact on our business, as well as work closely with our customers to understand those demand trends.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer: Sanjay, I wanted to go back to your comments you made about your expectation for DRAM demand, both this year of high-teens and longer term of mid to high-teens. I'm just kind of curious if you can give us a little bit more insight as to how you're building up those models. And I'll push back a little bit because we've got a very strong gaming console this year. We've got the move to 5G, as Ice Lake grants, we're going to go from six to eight channels in the server market. It seems like the risk to that forecast on demand is for the upside this year. And then conversely, as you think about servers as a percent of your DRAM business over the last five years, it's gone from 15 to 30 approximately. And given what we see around DRAM density going into next generation compute, especially around AI workloads, I would think that the historic 20% bit growth in DRAM demand should be something the industry should be able to maintain. I'm just kind of curious as to why you don't believe that?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So John, I mean we're giving you our best estimates with respect to demand assessment. And you would absolutely right to point out that the end market demands are certainly the demand trends are strong. The trends, the secular trends of AI, 5G, cloud and intelligent edge, including smart vehicles is absolutely strong growth driver for memory and storage in the years to come. Keep in mind for calendar year 2020, particularly in the late part of calendar year 2020, the demand went up strongly. So when we look at DRAM demand growth for calendar year 2020, we said that it is somewhat above 20% in calendar year '20 on a year-over-year basis. So that's what has really adjusting some of our assessment for calendar year '21 in terms of high-teens for the DRAM demand growth. In terms of how we come about these numbers we are always working closely with our customers, our market intelligence team is assessing the end market demand trends. What we see is over the course of next few years for DRAM that stronger than the average of the market would be mobile. 5G will be a long-term growth driver. In 2021, we do expect that 5G phones will be twice of what they were in calendar year 2020, going from 250 million units to 500 million units. And no question that average DRAM content in the 5G phones increases substantially as well, with minimum DRAM in 5G smartphones being 6 gigabyte. Yes, graphics, gaming consoles, new gaming consoles, new gaming graphics cards, also a strong driver and stronger than the average in 2021 of the DRAM growth. So I would be expect to be healthy and strong in 2021 as well based on all the reports that you have seen from various cloud suppliers about their CapEx investments and their workloads moving more toward AI and machine learning driving greater demand. And also certainly in 2021 auto unit sales will be demanding. And all of these and auto of course as vehicles are becoming more intelligent also driving greater content. All of these markets that I just mentioned, mobile, graphics, cloud, auto, we believe will grow stronger than the average of the market in 2021. Weaker than our average of the market would be the PC, although, PC overall will have unit growth in 2021 and Micron is well positioned with PC market as well. All I'm saying is that compared to the average of the industry, the DRAM bit growth in PC, I believe would be somewhat less than the average. And enterprise continues to be somewhat weak as well. And with the recovery rebound from the pandemic, we would expect during the course of the year, enterprise will recover as well. So these are all -- this is how we look at the end market in 2021. And this is what leads us particularly on the heels of a very strong above 20% bit growth in calendar year 2020, this is what leads us to project high teens kind of number for 2021. And when we look beyond that, as you noted we see that overall, DRAM CAGR, multiyear CAGR will be mid teens to high teens, some years maybe a little bit less, some years little bit more, but we are talking about the general CAGR there. And of course, we work closely with our customers, we work closely with understanding their demand and we also have annual supply agreements with several of our customers in various parts of the market. This is all what helps us build the intelligence that led us to the numbers. And John, we look at these numbers on a very regular basis, we assess them and of course we make adjustments as is necessary. And when we make adjustments in those projections, we of course make adjustments in our own expectations of how to manage our supply, because our goal is to manage our supply growth to be in line with the industry demand growth on a CAGR basis.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore.
C.J. Muse: I guess I'd like to focus on cost downs, and you talked about down mid single digits in fiscal '21. And curious what kind of impact is embedded in that number for the disruption that you have seen in the last month? And then as you think about the ramp of 1-alpha and the 40% increase in bit output versus 1z, I would love to hear your thoughts on what kind of acceleration we should see in cost downs on the DRAM side beyond August, and when we really see that that uptick in savings through your 1-alpha ramp? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So on the cost downs for this year, as you mentioned, DRAM our expectation is that we see mid single digit cost downs this year that is our -- the cost impacts of the disruptions we experienced at the beginning of this quarter and late last quarter are embedded in that for sure. As you look into more, I should say as we progress through this year and into next year, 1-alpha will become more and more of our volume, that should bode well for our cost declines. And that’s one of the reasons why we think most of the cost decline we'll see in DRAM is really back end, back half of FY21 loaded. But we do expect to see that lead to further cost improvements in FY22 as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen.
Karl Ackerman: Maybe just to follow-up on CJ's question on DRAM cost decline, I'd like to move over to NAND. I appreciate the commentary on NAND cost improvement, which you called out low to mid teens. Is there a way to quantify the cost headwind from your transition to replacement gate? Because I would imagine that would be fairly sizable even in fiscal 2021. And I have a quick follow-up.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So if you looked at last year, FY20, our cost declines were pretty negligible actually on NAND, because of the transition to the first generation of replacement gate. And really the only area where we got any sort of cost declines was in the change over and depreciation for NAND from five to seven years. As we move into the second generation, as we talked about this 176 layer has a particularly good cost structure. And so that will obviously be the big factor in terms of driving our cost declines in the low teens for this year. And again, we're going to be ramping this through the year and into next year. So we do feel like this will be a tailwind for our cost reductions as well. You didn't ask about this but on top of that, as we talked about on the call, we have good momentum in QLC that should be also a good tailwind for NAND costs as well.
Karl Ackerman: You recognized a record of graphics DRAM quarter. Just kind of curious if graphics are now closer to 20% of this segment now. And then I guess, what sort of graphics DRAM demand are you seeing from GPU's used for cryptocurrency mining now that those currencies are now at all time high? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So as it relates to graphics that is in single digits overall as part of the industry as well as part of our business, if anything Micros actually leads in the graphic segment. With respect to our leading-edge, high performance power efficient DRAMs, our GDDR6, our GDDR6X products are very well-positioned with industry-leading specification in the graphics market. You know about GDDR6X that would be introduced with the PAM4 interface with twice the data transfer rate of the traditional DRAM memory before. So we are very proud of our leadership in the graphics market and certainly some part of our graphics market addresses the crypto mining applications as well. So that's embedded within our graphics revenue that we talked about. Basically some of the graphics cards that are built using GDDR6 and GDDR6X memory and other graphics memories that we supply are used in crypto mining applications. And crypto mining is just pointing to yet another continuing digitization of the economy, yet another application. It will be an important -- crypto currency will certainly be very important in the future and data mining needs there, crypto mining needs definitely need higher performance memory and Micron DRAM memory, Micron graphics products are well-positioned in that part of the market.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.
Timothy Arcuri: I just had two. First, Sanjay, I wanted to double click on a prior question. So I understand that the demand was better during the late part of last year, but you also took down your forecast for this year. You were thinking of 20 and now you're up more like high-teens. So is there any component of digestion that you're fearing in mobile? Is that part of it too, or is it just the math that you have the same number of bits off of the higher base last year? And then I had a follow-up for Dave? Thanks.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Yes, it's simply is, Tim, the later of what you just said that it is, the overall demand in 2021, we absolutely based on all the demand drivers that we see, that we describe in our script, we see really continued strong trend of demand in 2021. So it is what you said that 2020 has a higher base, because 2020 demand for DRAM went above 20% with that higher base compared to our prior expectations we have said that high-teens. Nonetheless, let there be no confusion, I mean 2021 overall DRAM demand trend across the board, across our market except for the enterprise where we have said enterprise resense will go away once the pandemic recovery takes fold fully on the economy. But whether it is auto, or it is smartphones, or it is cloud, or graphics, all of these end markets are pointing to strong demand of units, as well as strong demand for average content increases in 2021. So we are very excited about the demand opportunities. And keep in mind this is in the backdrop of CapEx management, disciplined CapEx management in the DRAM industry leading really to a supply environment where we think that the supply growth will be less than the industry demand growth in 2021, which steps up 2021 very nicely for the DRAM fundamentals. And that too with Micron's execution on technology and products continuing to strengthen our position there really very proud and excited about Micron's position with industry leading 1-alpha node now, which of course over the course of next selling quarters will be ramping into production.
Timothy Arcuri: Dave, super quick, you didn't buyback any stock. And I know that you bring more cash than maybe you thought, because there was some working capital that was a little sort of worked against you. But why not give -- why not buyback stock given the improving outlook and obviously you're going to generate a lot of free cash flow during the fiscal back half of the year and your stock seems to be higher. So why not buyback any stock during fiscal Q1? Thanks.
Dave Zinsner: Yes, I wouldn't read too much into it. I mean, if you look back over the last couple of years, I think we generated mid $4 billion levels of cash flow. And if you combine the converts and the buybacks, we spent probably closer to $4.7 billion or so on all of that. So we're definitely committed to the buyback. I would expect that our target is certainly just to generate free cash flow for the year. And I think you can expect us to remain committed in terms of returning at least or more than 50% of the free cash flow in the form of buybacks. But one other metric that we do to try to focus on is our net cash, our cash excess of our debt. And of course when we're not generating cash, when we're going to need cash, we eat into that a bit. And so I think just to be cautious, we wanted to make sure that we didn't eat into that net cash balance too much. But I'm not really reflective of any view on the stock price and we remain buyers overtime of the stock.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.
Harlan Sur: Your cloud business remained relatively healthy for calendar year '20, and I know that the team is expecting strength this year. But maybe more from a near-term perspective. Is that seem to be some growing indications that data center spending is going to start to reaccelerate here in the first half of this calendar year? On top of that, you have some of the new processor ramps that are coming to the market as well. Is the team seen the strength here in Q2 and in your orders or customer forecast? And then can you just give us an update on your DDR5 server products? Are you guys finished with qualification of these new products ahead of the second half adoption cycle?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So with respect to cloud, yes, I mean, compared to our pre-COVID expectations, 2020 was a strong year for cloud and we did well. It was good for the industry and it was good for us as well. And yes, we definitely in 2021 as well continue to see strength in cloud, healthy business environment, healthy demand for cloud and continuing to work with our leading edge technology nodes as we get that ready into production with 1-alpha to get that qualified with our customers. So yes, cloud is long term secular demand driver for our industry. And again, it is the trend of AI and ML and the workloads that are requiring more memory. And you are absolutely right to note that companies are in 2021 introducing new CPU's and compute architectures, which will have more cores, which will have more channels, more DRAM attach rate. And with the end market appetite of need for more memory and the compute architectures and processes enabling greater DRAM attach rate in the servers, yes, this trend of more memory in the cloud environment will continue in this trend it's here to stay for considerable period of time even beyond 2021 timeframe. With respect to DDR5 that is really in the very early innings at this point. We are happy with our product position there. And the DDR5 will start picking up in terms of revenue opportunity later on in 2021.
Harlan Sur: Thank you, Sanjay. 
Sanjay Mehrotra: We’re still in the qualification phases and there’s some revenue opportunity, but we are well position.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. 
Joe Moore: You guys continue to have this kind of negative leaning language on NAND, but you did inject that it could improve over the course of this year as people moderate their plans. It seems like the spending a fairly front half loaded and will moderate over the course of the year. What are you looking at there to sort of gauge whether that could get better or worse over the course of the year? And what's the -- am I right to sort of say that there's a little bit more optimism in the way that you phrase that?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So certainly, NAND as traditionally has been the case, has elasticity that is an important part of the NAND market and even elasticity will continue to drive greater content in the various end market applications from the smartphones, to client notebook computers, to data center applications as well. And post the pandemic, we definitely expect that across the tech space, there will be release of pent up demand and that itself for a couple of years is going to drive increasing demand. Overall, when we look at 2021, we expect the demand growth in NAND to be approximately 30%. And our estimation is that supply perhaps somewhat above demand. And as elasticity kicks in, as the post COVID, post-pandemic and what demand environment builds up, as well as with greater focus from the industry in terms of management of the supply then we do believe that NAND fundamentals can strengthen. As far as Micron is concerned, I mean, we definitely are extremely focused on managing our supply growth with discipline. With our 176-layer NAND, we are very excited about our industry first position with this technology, but we manage our supply growth. And we expect that Micron supply -- overall, supply growth will be below the industry demand growth. And of course, we will supplement that with some of the inventory. So that in terms of our shipment growth in 2021, it will be in line with the industry demand growth expectations. But management of the supply, I think is an important factor in the industry in terms of overtime, returning to the healthier levels of the NAND industry along with elasticity and post-COVID NAND demand environment.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari: I wanted to ask about CapEx and curious what the internal debate is today at Micron. Obviously, you guys didn't make any changes to your full year budget of $9 billion. But on the DRAM side, Sanjay, is it fair to say given the outlook over the next year or so if there is a bias internally, the bias to the upside from a spending perspective and conversely, on the NAND side have you -- to Joe's question, you've struck this cautionary note over the past couple of quarters. I realize you guys are being fairly prudent and focusing on your transition. But what would you need to see for you to turn conservative from a spending perspective in NAND? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So again, I think both for DRAM and for NAND, I think it is extremely important for us at Micron on an ongoing basis to stay disciplined with respect to supply growth, with respect to investments in CapEx to manage our supply grows to be in line with the industry demand growth expectations on a CAGR basis. And this is where our focus is, because that's the best way to generate ROI on our investment. We feel very good about our CapEx discipline and are focused on really driving profitability of the business through increasing our share, not just chasing bit share but increasing the profit share of the industry. And this is where are focused on differentiated solutions, both in NAND as well as in DRAM to strengthen our position, to strengthen the merits of the product portfolio is an important part of our strategy. But with respect to the CapEx discussions, it always is about really discipline on supply growth, staying in line with the demand growth.
Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.
Mitch Steves: I wanted to double click, and while I’m sure you're going to get this on all these callbacks. So when you talk about the DRAM impact for Q2 -- the second quarter guide. Can you walk us through kind of the magnitude of the impact, i.e. how much of that 31% kind of midpoint is being negatively impacted by DRAM? Any sort of qualitative answer there would be very helpful. And then secondly as it relates to NAND, it sounds like you guys are a little bit cautious there. Can you maybe talk us through what you guys expect to see from the smartphone market given the fact that we're going to see kind of a elevated Q1 due to the change in product cycles, but then how should we think about kind of 2H, calendar year 2H smartphone demand as you guys see it right now?
David Zinsner: So I'll take the first one and Sanjay will take the smartphone question. So yes, of course there was a cost impact, or will be a cost impact in the second quarter associated with this disruption. I wouldn't say it's a massive, it's measured in tens of basis points, not hundreds of basis points that we factored in the quarter.
Sanjay Mehrotra: And with respect to smartphone content growth, certainly with 5G the average content continue to increase in smartphones. We have talked about in the past that how DRAM content in smartphones is 8 gigabyte to 12 to 16 gigabyte, even in certain phones and average content increase in the smartphone market will be in the double digit. And again, in the smartphone, I think it's important to understand that not only is it about the 5G number of units increasing, more than doubling calendar year '20 or calendar year '21 going from 250 million 5G smartphones in '20 to 500 million plus in 2021. But the average content of DRAM is increasing in these 5G phones as well. So that's the multiplicative impact with respect to the DRAM demand growth in the smartphone market. And if you look at the calendar of DRAM content over the course of next three years or so, that CAGR of average content growth in the smartphone market is in the double digits range. So smartphone will continue to be a strong market and we are very well positioned with our NAND and DRAM combination to address the growing opportunities in the smartphone markets. We mentioned in the earnings call prepared remarks that our MCP revenues, MCPs with multi chip packages that include DRAM as well as NAND we are extremely well positioned being the manufacturer of both DRAM and NAND that MCP revenue hit a record in our fiscal Q1 timeframe. So smartphones, continues to be a strong and the largest market for DRAM and NAND and we are really well positioned there and quite excited about the opportunities here, including introduction of our LPGDDR5 and uMCP5 industry leading solutions.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.

Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Farhan. Good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered solid fiscal fourth quarter revenue and profitability driven by strength in DRAM shipments to cloud, PC, and game console customers. As I reflect on the fiscal year 2020 accomplishments, I am extremely proud of our Micron team, whose dedication and tenacity enabled the new Micron to deliver customer value and healthy financial results throughout fiscal 2020. In DRAM, we introduced the industry’s first 1z nanometer node. We were first to market with mobile LP5 products and shattered industry performance records with our graphics GDDR6X innovation. In NAND, we began shipping our first replacement gate-based products and drove significant increases in our QLC mix. In addition, in fiscal Q4 we already achieved our high value solutions mix target. We are entering fiscal 2021 with momentum in our product portfolio and confidence in our technology roadmap and manufacturing capabilities. This year, COVID-19 presented a real-life stress test of the new Micron’s resilience. Thanks in large part to the commitment and innovation of our team members around the globe, we continue to operate our fabs at normal capacity and achieved record production from our assembly and test facilities in Xi’an, Taiwan, and Singapore. Stringent, industry-leading safety protocols have enabled us to gradually return to work on-site. As of today, almost three quarters of Micron team members are back on-site, with our manufacturing operations running close to fully staffed levels. The new Micron is also making solid progress toward our goals to bring differentiated industry-leading products to our customers and to improve our product mix and cost structure so that we can grow our share of industry profits, all while maintaining stable bit share. In DRAM, we are leading the industry in 1z nanometer production mix, and this node was a significant contributor to our fiscal fourth quarter sales. We are making good progress on our next-generation 1-alpha node, which remains on track for introduction in fiscal 2021. We are further strengthening our DRAM product portfolio. This quarter, we announced GDDR6X, the world’s fastest discrete graphics memory solution and the first to power system bandwidth up to 1 terabyte per second. GDDR6X is a great example of close collab -- customer collaboration on differentiated technology that significantly improves the end user experience. Our innovative GDDR6X memory is featured in the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 and 3080 graphics cards that deliver an immersive, real-life gaming experience. Our strength in graphics DRAM also positions us well for the data center market, where growth in GPU computing is being driven by AI workloads. We are also excited about our progress with high-bandwidth memory to serve the fast-growing AI market and remain on track to commence volume shipments by the end of this year. In NAND, we are on track for replacement gate to make up a meaningful portion of our NAND output by the end of calendar 2020. Our 128-layer, first-generation RG NAND technology entered volume production in fiscal Q3 2020; and in fiscal Q4, we began shipping RG-based consumer SSDs. We are also making good progress on our second-generation RG node, which we expect to introduce into volume production during fiscal 2021. This industry-leading technology will be broadly deployed across our product portfolio and drive NAND cost reduction later in fiscal 2021 and into fiscal 2022. We are also driving product innovations and cost reductions through an increased mix of QLC NAND. Our QLC innovations offer PC customers a more cost-effective, high-capacity SSD solution, and data center customers a highly effective HDD replacement option with a compelling value proposition. We are leading the industry with the broadest portfolio of QLC SSDs across client, consumer, and data center and are seeing QLC adoption accelerate. Our mix of QLC SSD bits more than doubled quarter-over-quarter surpassing our expectations. Fiscal 2020 has been an extraordinary year for our high-value solutions, which now make up around 80% of our quarterly NAND bits, achieving the goal we had set for ourselves ahead of schedule. We are now intensifying our focus on profitability enhancement through further improvements to our product mix within our high value solutions portfolio. Over the next several quarters, we will be introducing a slate of new SSD and mobile NAND products that leverage increased vertical integration using our internally developed controllers and our industry-leading second-generation replacement gate TLC and QLC technology. Turning to end markets. Fiscal 2020 was a strong year for our SSD business. We expanded our NVMe portfolio and continued our SATA market leadership. Fiscal Q4 SSD revenue almost doubled year-over-year led by data center SSD sales. Client SSD average capacities grew almost 30% quarter-over-quarter driven by QLC growth. Consumer SSD had another record quarter in volume shipped with NVMe bits more than doubling quarter-over-quarter. Turning to data center, memory, and networking, the data center market continues to be a growth engine for Micron; and this year COVID-19 accelerated this growth, specifically in cloud. Leveraging our industry-leading 1z DRAM, Micron executed well to drive robust sequential growth in cloud DRAM bit shipments, which more than doubled year-over-year in fiscal Q4. Meanwhile, traditional on-premise enterprise demand was weaker in fiscal Q4 with lower IT investment from businesses due to the impact of the pandemic. Looking ahead, the data center market is expected to start its transition to DDR5 in the second half of fiscal 2021, and we have begun sampling DDR5 server modules to customers. In networking, 5G deployments, particularly in Asia, drove healthy DRAM bit growth quarter-over-quarter. In Mobile, Micron is well-positioned to win in the 5G era as a supplier to all the major smartphone manufacturers with an outstanding portfolio of industry-leading low power DRAM and managed NAND solutions. We have been diversifying and broadening our mobile business for some time and achieved a record number of design wins in fiscal Q4. We are also excited about our product momentum in mobile MCP solutions, which combine DRAM and NAND solutions into one efficient package. The smartphone market has been impacted by the pandemic in a meaningful way in calendar 2020, but as we look ahead to calendar 2021, we expect a rebound in smartphone unit volumes coupled with robust average capacity growth across both DRAM and NAND solutions. 5G handset volumes could grow to approximately 500 million units in 2021 from around 200 million units in calendar 2020, and these 5G products feature higher memory and storage content to enable enhanced consumer experiences. In the PC market, the work-from-home trend drove strong demand for notebooks with pockets of non-memory component shortages in the supply chain. Desktop PC sales are weak due to pandemic-driven changes to customer buying patterns. In graphics, GDDR6 shipments to support next-generation gaming consoles, in addition to the initial shipments of our breakthrough GDDR6X product, helped drive strong quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year bit growth. We expect this market to drive growth for us in fiscal 2021. DRAM and NAND content growth continues to be a secular trend in the automotive market, supported by advanced infotainment systems and increased automation in cars. COVID-19 has significantly impacted both auto production and demand in fiscal 2020, but we saw a strong recovery toward the end of fiscal Q4 and expect sequential growth in sales of our products into the automotive market in FQ1. Economic recovery from the sharp recession in calendar Q2 is underway, but the pace has been limited by the continuation of the pandemic. Smartphone, auto and consumer end markets have started to recover, and we see further demand improvements ahead. Cloud and laptop demand continues to be healthy, supported by the work-from-home and shop from home trends. Gaming demand is robust. However, our short-term outlook has weakened due to a combination of factors. First, the ongoing pandemic is taking a toll on certain segments of the economy. Consequently, Enterprise demand has weakened due to lower IT spending and somewhat higher inventories at certain customers. In addition, due to the previously announced U.S. administration restrictions on Huawei, we halted shipments to Huawei on September 14th. Huawei has been a large customer, at approximately 10% of fiscal Q4 sales. Given that we only had a one month notice before halting shipments, we had limited ability to shift supply to other customers. As a result, we expect a negative impact to fiscal Q1 sales and to a lesser extent, fiscal Q2 sales. Our well-established relationships with mobile customers worldwide will allow us to offset the impact of these restrictions by the end of fiscal Q2. Now turning to our industry outlook. We now estimate that calendar 2020 industry DRAM bit demand growth is likely to be in the mid-teens percent range, while NAND bit demand growth is likely to be in the mid-20s. Due to the shift of industry production capacity to a more efficient 16-gigabit die, we are seeing industry supply constraints for 8-gigabit-based DRAM products. We are optimistic that overall market demand will improve throughout calendar 2021, following the seasonal patterns of the first calendar quarter. We are very excited by the combination of growth drivers coming into alignment for the industry for calendar 2021. These growth drivers include, economic recovery from the pandemic, new CPU architectures, which are enabling higher server content, cloud, AI and machine-learning growth, robust mobile demand driven by 5G, and strength in gaming and automotive. We expect calendar 2021 industry DRAM bit demand growth of approximately 20%. We further expect that disciplined industry CapEx will result in improving DRAM market conditions and industry profitability throughout calendar 2021. Calendar 2021 industry NAND bit demand growth is expected to be approximately 30%. Unless industry CapEx moderates from current levels or demand exceeds our expectations, we see a risk of challenging NAND industry profitability levels. Turning to Micron supply, we target our bit supply growth CAGR to be in line with industry bit demand growth CAGR for both DRAM and NAND. However, there can be year-to-year variability caused by node transition timing. For example, we expect our DRAM bit supply growth to be above industry demand in calendar 2020, but to moderate to less than industry demand in calendar 2021. In NAND, we expect our bit supply growth in calendar 2020 to be well below the industry demand due to our ongoing RG transition. In calendar 2021, we expect our NAND bit supply growth to be somewhat below the industry demand and we plan to use inventory to support a bit shipment growth that is in line with the industry demand. For fiscal 2021, we expect DRAM cost reduction in the mid single-digit percent range, with somewhat higher levels of cost reductions on a like-for-like basis. Our higher mix of LP5, graphics and our early ramp of high-bandwidth memory will impact overall DRAM costs. We anticipate NAND cost reduction in the low- to mid-teens percent range, even after accounting for the cost impact of our mix shift as we continue our focus on optimizing our high value solutions portfolio. We are targeting fiscal 2021 CapEx to be approximately $9 billion to support our long-term goal of maintaining stable share of industry bit supply, which will be achieved through node transitions alone and without a net increase to wafer starts. This CapEx target is significantly lower than our pre-COVID expectations and reflects our continued commitment to exercise supply discipline, while staying focused on deploying our leading-edge technology nodes, which deliver strong ROI. Within this CapEx envelope, fab building CapEx will remain elevated relative to historical levels. We are also continuing investments in back-end assembly and test capacity that do not impact bit growth but have strong ROI. Should demand expectations change, we remain flexible to adjust our bit supply growth to align with bit demand growth, using CapEx and utilization as levers. Despite COVID-19’s broad impact on our lives and the business environment, we believe it has accelerated demand growth in some parts of the markets we serve. This is certainly true in cloud deployments, where some trends that would have taken two years to four years to develop have been accelerated into months and will likely persist into the future. As we look ahead, we remain extremely excited about the growth and health of our diverse end markets, which will benefit from powerful secular technology trends including AI, 5G and IoT. These trends will enable the data economy and increase the importance of DRAM and NAND, supporting a long-term DRAM bit demand growth CAGR of mid- to high-teens, and a NAND bit demand growth CAGR of approximately 30%. I will now turn it over to Dave to provide our financial results and guidance.
Dave Zinsner: Thanks, Sanjay. We generated solid results in the fiscal fourth quarter, with revenue and earnings per share coming in above the midpoint of our guided range, despite significant demand variability as customers continue to react to the impacts of COVID-19. Total FQ4 revenue was approximately $6.1 billion, up 11% sequentially and 24% year-over-year. As a reminder, our FQ4 results reflect a 14-week quarter and the extra week contributed to revenues, costs and expenses for the quarter. Sequential revenue growth was led by strong DRAM shipments. Revenue was back-end loaded based on timing of customer demand. For the fiscal year 2020, total revenue was $21.4 billion, down 8% from the prior fiscal year. FQ4 DRAM revenue was $4.4 billion, representing 72% of total revenue. DRAM revenue increased 22% sequentially and 29% year-over-year. Bit shipments were up in the mid-20% range sequentially and ASPs were down in the lower single-digit percent range quarter-over-quarter. For the fiscal year, DRAM revenue was $14.5 billion, representing 68% of total revenue. DRAM revenue declined 14% from the prior fiscal year. FQ4 NAND revenue was approximately $1.5 billion, representing 25% of total revenue. NAND revenue declined 8% sequentially and was up 27% year-over-year. Bit shipments were approximately flat sequentially and ASPs declined in the upper single-digit percent range quarter-over-quarter. For the fiscal year, NAND revenue was $6.1 billion, representing 29% of total revenue. NAND revenue increased 14% from the prior fiscal year. Now turning to our revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the Compute and Networking Business Unit was approximately $3 billion, up approximately 36% sequentially and up 59% year-over-year. CNBU revenue was driven by continued strength in the Cloud and Client segments, following the work-from-home infrastructure build out, as well as growth in demand from gaming consoles. For the fiscal year, CNBU revenue was $9.2 billion, down 8% from the prior fiscal year. Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $1.5 billion, down 4% sequentially and up 4% year-over-year. For the fiscal year, MBU revenue was $5.7 billion, down 11% from fiscal 2019. Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $913 million, down 10% from FQ3 and up 8% year-over-year. For the fiscal year, SBU revenue was $3.8 billion, down 2% from fiscal 2019. Finally, revenue for the Embedded Business Unit was $654 million, down 3% sequentially and down 7% year-over-year. Demand continued to be below historical levels due to the impacts -- impact from COVID-19. Exiting the quarter, we began to see a sharp recovery in auto and consumer market demand, while industrial markets remained lackluster. For the fiscal year, EBU revenue was $2.8 billion, down 12% from fiscal 2019. The consolidated gross margin for FQ4 was 34.9%, up approximately 170 basis points from the prior quarter. Sequential gross margin improvement was driven by solid DRAM cost execution which benefitted from our 1z ramp. The impact of underutilization at our Lehi fab was $135 million or approximately 220 basis points in FQ4. We expect underutilization to gradually decline through fiscal 2021 as we redeploy equipment and continue to right-size our capacity. Operating expenses were $809 million in FQ4. While we have taken actions over the past several quarters to control our operating expenses, we expect operating expenses to increase over the course of fiscal 2021 as we make several investments in R&D to fund technology spending and to further grow and improve our product portfolio. FQ4 operating income was $1.3 billion, resulting in an operating margin of 21.5%, compared to 18% in the prior quarter and 14% in the prior year. Net interest expense increased to $31 million, compared to $24 million of net interest expense in the prior quarter. The increase was due to the lower yields on our cash investments, which reduced interest income. We expect net interest expense to increase modestly to approximately $35 million in FQ1. Our FQ4 effective tax rate was 3.6%, which benefited from approximately $16 million of one-time items. Going forward into fiscal 2021, we expect our tax rate to be in the high single-digit range. Non-GAAP earnings per share in FQ4 were $1.08, up from $0.82 in FQ3 and $0.56 in the year ago quarter. For the fiscal year, EPS was $2.83, down from $6.35 in fiscal 2019. Turning to cash flows and capital spending, we generated $2.3 billion in cash from operations in fiscal Q4, representing 38% of revenue. For the fiscal year, we generated $8.3 billion in cash from operations, down from $13.2 billion in the prior fiscal year. Net capital spending was approximately $2.2 billion during the quarter and approximately $7.9 billion for the fiscal 2020. Our future CapEx plans have come down versus our pre-COVID expectations. We now expect fiscal 2021 CapEx of approximately $9 billion. This CapEx investment will support our 1-alpha DRAM and second-generation replacement gate NAND ramps. NAND and backend equipment CapEx will increase year-on-year, while DRAM equipment CapEx will be roughly flat year-on-year. These investments will skew our CapEx spending toward the first two quarters of the fiscal year. As a result, we expect capital spending to outpace our operating cash flow in FQ1 and FQ2. We expect to return to healthy free cash flow levels in the second half of the fiscal year as we benefit from improved market conditions, declining costs and lower capital spending. Free cash flow in the quarter was $111 million, compared to $101 million in the prior quarter. This represents the 15th consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. For the fiscal year, we generated $361 million of free cash flow. We repurchased approximately 824,000 shares for $41 million in FQ4 at an average price of $49.91. In fiscal 2020, we have returned $176 million of capital through repurchases, representing approximately 50% of our free cash flow. Combining the convert premiums and share repurchases, we have used approximately $380 million or 105% of fiscal 2020 free cash flow toward reducing our fully diluted share count. Ending FQ4 inventory was $5.6 billion or 135 days versus 131 days last quarter. This is above our 110-day target due in part to elevated NAND inventory as we continue to transition to replacement gate. We are also holding higher levels of raw material during this period of supply uncertainty. We expect inventory levels to normalize over the course of the fiscal year. We ended the quarter with total cash of $9.3 billion and total liquidity of approximately $11.8 billion, flat quarter-over-quarter. FQ4 ending total debt was $6.6 billion. Now turning to our outlook. As a reminder, our fiscal first quarter will be a usual 13-week quarter, down from the 14 weeks in the fiscal fourth quarter. We have started to see recovery in the Mobile, Auto and Consumer markets, but the pace of recovery has been moderated by the continued impact of the pandemic, and shortages of certain non-memory components in some end markets. Enterprise demand is weak and some of our customers may be carrying higher inventory. We continue to be disciplined on pricing, walking away from certain deals that are below our profitability targets. Compared to our fiscal Q4 results normalized to adjust for the extra week, we expect DRAM shipments to be relatively flat and NAND shipments to grow somewhat in the first half of fiscal 2021 due to market conditions and the impact of the Huawei restrictions. We face headwinds in our gross margins in the first half of fiscal 2021 due to a mix shift toward NAND revenue, our pricing assumptions in the near-term driven by market conditions and temporarily higher costs related to our ramp of the first-generation replacement gate node and yield learning on new DRAM products such as graphics. We expect improved financial performance in the second half of the fiscal 2021 as we benefit from improved market conditions and declining costs. With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for FQ1 is as follows. We expect revenue to be $5.2 billion, plus or minus $200 million, gross margin to be in the range of 27.5% plus or minus 100 basis points, and operating expenses to be approximately $825 million, plus or minus $25 million. Finally, based on a share count of approximately 1.15 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $0.47, plus or minus $0.07. In closing, Micron continues to execute well despite continued market uncertainty and geopolitical challenges. Against the backdrop of a severe global recession caused by COVID-19, Micron has delivered solid performance in fiscal 2020, with revenues 70% higher and operating margins 12 percentage points higher than fiscal 2016. As we assess our cross-cycle performance over the last four years, we have delivered average gross margins of 40%, EBITDA margins of 50% and return on invested capital of 20%. Our cross-cycle performance has benefitted by the $9 billion in structural profitability improvements achieved from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2019 and we intend to continue to improve our cost competitiveness in the coming years. Our strong technology, dramatically improved product portfolio and financial strength position us well to capitalize on the long-running demand trends driving the memory and storage industry.  I will now turn the call over to Sanjay for closing remarks.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Dave. The positive momentum in our financial performance in calendar year 2020 has been interrupted by the unprecedented combination of a global pandemic and U.S. restrictions on shipments to Huawei. As we look toward the second half of fiscal 2021, we expect that the underlying momentum in our product portfolio and secular industry drivers such as AI and 5G will drive materially better financial and business performance. We are confident in the long-term growth trajectory of our industry. Memory and storage have become increasingly important across diverse end-market applications, spanning from the data center to the edge and from business to consumer. Within this context, Micron is getting stronger, not only financially, as Dave indicated, but also competitively. Micron is transforming into a product leadership company that is a trusted partner to our customers both for differentiated solutions and for continuity of supply. We are confident that our upcoming node transitions, our strengthening product portfolio and deeper customer engagements will further enhance our competitive position.  Micron’s transformation is taking place against a global backdrop of unprecedented environmental challenges. It is imperative that we are also environmentally responsible in our operations and Micron is playing a leadership role in this area. Last month, we solidified our commitment to sustainability, announcing specific and measurable environmental sustainability goals for calendar 2022 and 2030. These commitments will be a milestone toward our aspirational goals of reducing absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 40% from our calendar 2018 baseline, transitioning to 100% renewable energy where available, conserving 100% of our water use and sending zero waste to landfills. Reaching our goals will require investment and as we have previously discussed, we plan to devote approximately 2% of annual capital expenditures to environmental sustainability initiatives amounting to about $1 billion over the next five years to seven years. We will now open for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Toshiya Hari: Good afternoon and thank you very much for taking the question. Sanjay, in your prepared remarks, you noted your expectations for the DRAM market or the conditions there rather to improve in the second half of calendar 2021. I guess I am curious in making that statement, what sort of assumptions you are making on the demand side as well as the supply side over the next couple of quarters? It appears as though you are seeing supply side cuts from not just yourselves but also from your peers, and if anything the demand outlook in the server space remains fairly muted today. So do you expect server demand to remain weak, and therefore, you are only expecting a recovery in the second half or what sort of the key drivers in the timing of the recovery? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: First of all, let me just point out, you said, recovery in the second half of calendar year ‘20. What we said is, in the second half of our fiscal year ‘20. And DRAM, of course, the long-term drivers of growth are secular in nature, trend of AI and 5G, of course, will be a continuing driver of growth. In the near-term, I mean, a lot of -- let -- from an industry point of view, Enterprise servers have been weak and that’s impacting the demand outlook. And you also have to remember the context of the first half of the year. In the first half of calendar year 2020, as we had entered the year, we were definitely looking at strong demand trends building up through the year. The inventories by and large had normalized in the industry and then we got hit by COVID and that definitely impacted the demand outlook. It accelerated it in Cloud for a while. It accelerated it in Enterprise as well, as financial and other sectors invested in Enterprise server side. However, Enterprise has generally been weak. Cloud demand, given the work-from-home and e-commerce and streaming, all these kind of applications have driven strong growth on the cloud side, and we expect cloud to continue to be healthy in the second half. Of course, the first half of the calendar year 2020 saw a surge in demand in cloud. In the second half, we expect it to be somewhat moderated compared to the first half levels, but cloud will continue to be in a healthy place over the FQ1 and FQ2 timeframe, and it is a long-term driver of growth as well. 5G phones will be a strong driver of growth. And remember, in 2020, because of COVID, total smartphone unit sales got impacted and got lowered by something around 10% on a year-over-year basis. But in 2021, smartphone sales are expected to pick up. In fact, smartphone sales are already picking up in the marketplace right now. So not only is it a story of increasing smartphone sales, as we go through calendar 2021 beyond the seasonally slower first quarter of the calendar, but it is also the story in 5G of higher content, both for memory and storage. So these are the demand drivers that are driving -- that are giving us optimistic outlook for DRAM demand in calendar year 2021, continuing to improve starting from the beginning of the year, particularly as we get past the seasonal calendar Q1 timeframe. And of course, as you pointed out, the CapEx in the DRAM industry has been disciplined; and in that, I would position the industry when we look at the backdrop of demand expectation of approximately 20% in calendar year 2021 or 20% growth in DRAM. And look at the CapEx discipline that has existed in the industry, we think the environment -- overall these dynamics bode well for healthy environment in our second fiscal half of 2021 for DRAM. And of course, for ourselves, our second-generation DRAM, our 1-alpha node, which will begin production in fiscal year 2021 will position us very well, and our underlying momentum of our product portfolio both in NAND and DRAM will position us well as we go through calendar year 2021.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
John Pitzer: Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Sanjay, Dave, I wanted to talk a little bit kind of the margin profile for November and beyond. Dave, you mentioned that with the Huawei ban, you are going to see a mix shift towards NAND. If it was roughly kind of 70/20 in the August quarter, how do you think that trends into November and February, and does it get worse again in February or not? And I guess, just given that you guys are ahead of schedule on your move to higher value NAND, how should we think about gross margin progression in NAND from here, I know that the mix has been hampered by the lack of cost down with replacement gate. But I am just kind of curious as to how we should think about gross margin progression going forward in NAND just given that you have already hit your mix of high value targets?
Dave Zinsner: Okay. That was a three-part question in one. Good job, John. So let’s talk a little about the mix. Obviously, mix was pretty favorable in the fourth fiscal quarter, DRAM jumped up quite a bit from the previous quarter, up to low 70s as a percent of our total revenue. We would expect that to come down modestly and NAND to come up modestly. I am not sure it’s going to be the most significant story around gross margin, but it certainly will be a headwind. Tough to call on the second quarter, we do expect continued growth in NAND, and probably flattish in DRAM, so there’s probably a little bit more incremental mix headwind there. But as Sanjay indicated, in the back half of the fiscal year, we are very bullish around a lot of the markets that DRAM supports like cloud, like the mobile space, for 5G, and so we do expect a healthy recovery in DRAM beyond that. You mentioned the high value solutions. That obviously has been helpful and accretive to our business so far. We are continuing to drive that. We, in fact, actually now the story is even beyond NAND, it goes into the DRAM space, for example, with graphics. I talked about that it would start out being a little bit of a headwind on our gross margins the first fiscal quarter because of the early ramp of the product. But as that hits its stride as we go through fiscal and calendar 2021, we would expect that to be very beneficial in the gross margin side. You mentioned also replacement gate. So as you know, replacement gate has kept our cost reductions on the NAND front relatively flat in fiscal 2020, about the only real cost reduction we got in fiscal 2021 out of NAND was really the depreciation change. There’s not a huge change in the fiscal first quarter around NAND as the first-generation of replacement gate still is the major story there. But as Sanjay talked about, we will be ramping second-generation replacement gate next year and so that should be a benefit. We do think that its cost reductions are quite positive and should be very helpful in driving what we said in the prepared remarks is low-single -- low double-digit cost declines on NAND and that’s with mix being a factor in it and so it’s even better without that. And also, I would say on the DRAM front, we are looking at our cost reductions next year and even with mix should be pretty respectable and that includes all that increased cost and higher margin products that we will be shipping next year, but also will include the -- graphics will also benefit the gross margins as well. So, I think, I said, on the NAND, I said, low mid-teens costs, but it was actually low double-digit, I should say, cost reductions or low- to mid-teens cost reductions instead of low double-digit cost reductions.
John Pitzer: Dave, maybe another way to ask the question is, when you take pricing out of the equation, because I know that’s the biggest driver. Are the other drivers of sort of gross margin progression? Are the headwinds peaking in the November quarter or would you expect them to stick around into February beyond?
Dave Zinsner: On the DRAM front, whether it extends into the second quarter it’s possible. But I think in the back half of the year, it’s certainly going to be a good story on the gross margin front as we get more mature yields on those products. On the NAND front, I think, really I think, the bigger driver is going to be this switchover to the second-generation of replacement gate and that’s really where we start to see the cost improvement, because we are at a pretty high level of high value solutions on the NAND front.
John Pitzer: All right. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead.
C.J. Muse: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Dave, to follow on to John’s question. If we could isolate just on the DRAM gross margin side of things. It looks like it’s an implied gross margin for November around 31%, and I am just curious here that’s below the fiscal 2020 trough. And so within that, how much of that is conservatism around pricing? Is there a write-down of Huawei inventory and I guess what kind of snapback specifically to the mix around HBM and graphics should we see in terms of a gross margin snapback into the second half of fiscal ‘21?
Dave Zinsner: Yeah. So the Huawei impacts that we had on the gross margin front were largely accounted for in the fourth fiscal quarter. Although, there is potential for more, depending on how the rest of the bits get consumed. On the high value products within DRAM, clearly, the first couple of quarters will be somewhat of a kind of headwind to the gross margins. But it’s simply kind of a ramp timing challenge and it just so happens that where we are seeing pricing be a little bit more negative. That just so happens to coincide with a couple of quarters where our costs are kind of running higher. But I don’t really think, I mean, this is somewhat of a near-term challenge that will correct itself over time, particularly as though -- again, as those products get to more mature yields and we get the mix going in the right direction for us. I would tell you, just as it relates, we obviously don’t want to go into details around the difference in margins between DRAM and NAND, specifically. I would just tell you that, your estimate of DRAM is low relative to what it is in reality.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Blayne Curtis: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was just curious on Huawei. I just want to confirm. I think you said you are not shipping to them. There have been some stories about companies getting licenses on the server side. Just your perspective, one, you are totally not shipping. When you said 10%, I know it sounded like there was maybe catch-up before the 15th. Just kind of curious how elevated that was and then any prospects on getting a license going forward?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So that’s -- in our fiscal fourth quarter, Huawei was slightly under 10% of our total revenue. And given that the order had come in from the commerce pretty late in the quarter. In terms of any upside from Huawei in our fiscal fourth quarter, it was really very, very small. Now, with respect to FQ1, yes, we start shipment effective September 14th. So what that means is that our revenue declines substantially with Huawei in fiscal Q1 and that clearly is a significant headwind to us. Huawei has been a large customer to us, not only in FQ4 of 2020, but as we have reported before. It has been our largest customer for significant period of time in prior several quarters as well. So the impact of Huawei as related commerce department ruling is significant impact to our revenue in FQ1, and obviously, it is baked into our FQ1 guidance here. Specific to the licenses, we have applied for licenses. It’s important to understand that our previous licenses did not give us the ability that -- our previous licenses at this point do not give us the ability to ship to Huawei from our non-U.S. fabs. We need new licenses for that, which we have applied for and we do not know if and when those licenses would be granted.
Blayne Curtis: Thanks. And then is there a way to think about in terms of particularly mobile market customers positioning to try to take share from Huawei and if you have seen any uptick in the mobile market relative to that?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So as we said in our prepared remarks that with respect to the lost opportunity at Huawei, it will take us a while to shift our production, as well as address the demand from other customers within the mobile ecosystem. There is no question that the end market mobile demand will be what it is projected to be and to the extent that Huawei is not able to fulfill that demand going forward, that demand will be supplied by other smartphone manufacturers. Micron is well-engaged with the entire ecosystem of smartphone manufacturers. We have had strong relationships with those customers. We have been a strong supplier to them. Our portfolio of solutions has only strengthened over time, making us a valued partner to the rest of the mobile ecosystem as well. So as we shift from Huawei toward those other customers, it will take us some time. It will have impact in FQ1, as I noted earlier. It will have less impact in FQ2, but by end of FQ2 and beyond, we will be able to make up for any loss on the Huawei front with other smartphone manufacturers assuming that we don’t get licensed to Huawei in this timeframe.
Blayne Curtis: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On your Enterprise SSD business, it’s been obviously a big contributor to the value-added mix shift. I believe your share has grown above 300 basis points since the beginning of this year. You guys are in a strong number three global share position. Is the momentum coming from your SATA-based portfolio or is it more growth and share gain from your newer NVMe based products? And on the November guide, are you seeing a slowdown in this segment, given the weaker Enterprise trends and just longer term as you look into next year, how is the team planning to maintain its share momentum in this segment?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, certainly, our SATA leadership has helped us in the Enterprise Data Center market and SATA still is a meaningful portion of the Enterprise SSD market even though it is shifting rapidly to NVMe. And, yes, we have growing presence in Enterprise with our NVMe solutions and we have good products. Although, we are in early stages of growing our NVMe opportunity, and, yes, for future quarters, as we go through fiscal 2021 and -- calendar 2021, we will continue to expand our portfolio of solutions with NVMe products targeted for a broader set of applications in the Enterprise space. And as you noted, we have done well with our SSD Solutions compared to years past. We have continued to expand our portfolio in not only Enterprise but also in the Client PC side and Consumer SSD side. In fact, our QLC is a good success story here, as we noted in our remarks, with the broadest portfolio in Enterprise SSDs, as well as Client and Consumer SSDs. So we will be bringing out exciting new products over the course of 2020 and 2021 timeframe and we certainly do plan to increase our presence in the SSD marketplace with broader and richer portfolio solutions.
Harlan Sur: Thanks, Sanjay.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.
Timothy Arcuri: Hi. Thanks. I guess, I wanted to ask on Huawei again. So, obviously, it’s public that the processor companies have gotten to license. So I certainly understand that you have to take this out of your guidance. But if they got a license, I guess, why wouldn’t you would be the first part of that question. And then the second question is, can you help us think about sort of handicapping if you did get a license, could we just add 10% back, do you think it will go back to being roughly a 10% customer? I guess I am asking all this because this has been going on for some time and you seem to always have the view that the bits were fairly fungible, but now it sounds like it’s going to take six months if you don’t get a license. So I am just wondering if you could sort of double click on that for me? Thanks.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, first of all, we really cannot comment on other companies obtaining licenses. As we noted, that we have applied for licenses, but we cannot speculate if and when those licenses will be granted. And with respect to if licenses are granted, obviously, it will depend on what is Huawei’s demand at that point. We will, of course, always supply to our customers and always make sure that we are meeting our commitments to our customers. Huawei along with other customers have been valued partners. So if we are given the opportunity with licenses to supply to Huawei, we will certainly become a partner again, given the strong partnership we have enjoyed in the past with them. But it will really depend on what is their demand profile at that point and what have been our commitments to other customers already in place and we will have to manage through all of that. But certainly, if licenses are granted, we will have a growing opportunity to engage again with Huawei. And that’s -- remember that’s our goal, we always want to have broad portfolio of products and a diversified set of customers. We have done well in this area over time, and as you can see, that even though largest customer in Huawei essentially in a very short period of time disappears for us in terms of revenue opportunity, we are able to adjust it given our portfolio and given our customer engagement with rest of the customers. But it just takes supply chain. The nature of the semiconductor supply chain is that it does take a while to shift that production. Even for other smartphone manufacturers in terms of filling any void created by Huawei, it does take them to adjust things in the supply chain as well. So we will, of course, continue to work with the broad ecosystem of smartphone suppliers to address the future demand for smartphone.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital. Please go ahead.
Mitch Steves: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I have one on the technical side. I think you are seeing X86 and ARM come up more and more on the server side at the bait point. So I am just curious, if we do see a future where there’s more ARM-based servers, does that change the overall demand for DRAM or memory in general or is there no real change if we move into other ARM-based environment?
Sanjay Mehrotra: No. Regardless of the kind of compute architecture, whether it is X86-based or AI-based or ARM-based, I mean, the need for memory and storage is there in all those architectures and all those applications. The need is being driven by trends like AI. AI relies on more and more data to derive greater intelligence and greater value for business and consumer experiences. So regardless of how the hardware platform is built, all applications require more memory and storage. And for example, in mobile, there is a great deployment of ARM processors today and Micron is a strong supplier and mobile is a large market for memory and storage applications.
Mitch Steves: Okay. Perfect.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Basically. Yeah. That just creates an opportunity for more choices for customers and just only diversifies our applications and our end market opportunity can be in storage.
Mitch Steves: Okay. Then just one small one. You guys mentioned you are having trouble getting certain components. It was unclear to me whether its data center or smartphone related. Could you maybe just give us an idea what’s going on? What type of components you guys are unable to find to create some new products?
Sanjay Mehrotra: To be clear, we were not referring to components that we are not able to procure. I was referring in my prepared remarks that in the PC segment, particularly with the surge in demand in notebooks, particularly Chromebooks. There have been -- in the PC supply chain there have been certain component shortages that PC manufacturers have frankly talked about in their own earnings calls. So it’s not any component shortages for Micron’s supply chain. We were just referring to the end market component shortages in the PC supply chain. That has some impact on the demand when they are not able to procure all the components they need for their notebook and Chromebook builds.
Mitch Steves: Okay. Understood. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Please go ahead.
Ambrish Srivastava: Hi. Thanks very much. I had a question on the cost side. Dave, I just wanted to make sure I understood this. So when you started fiscal ‘20 on the DRAM side, you had talked about high single-digit cost down, but then I think in the middle of the year, you had said that it would be low single-digit. So question is what did the cost down end up being for the fiscal year and then for fiscal ‘21, you are saying low single-digit again. Is that partly because of the Huawei impact in fiscal 1Q or is that the new normal or is there the impact of lower yields, I am just trying to understand that? And then a follow up, Sanjay, you have seen to have raised the flag on NAND industry profitability for the full year. Could you -- and if I caught that correct, could you give a little bit more details around the comments you made in your prepared remarks? Thank you.
Dave Zinsner: Okay. So on the cost front, just to be clear, Ambrish, it was -- the cost declines in FY’20 were -- on DRAM were in the mid-single digits and the expectation would be -- they would be somewhat in the mid-single digits again in FY’21. On FY’20, there wasn’t really much mix that impacted it. So that was legitimately what the cost was. There were a few things that we probably could have executed a little bit better on that drove a little bit of it. I’d also say, we had a lot of COVID mitigation expenses running over time in different areas and tariffs went higher than we expected. So there were some things that kind of went against us as it relates to COVID and that kind of muted our cost improvement for FY’20. I would say on 2021, this mid single-digit cost decline includes the impacts of mix. So if you strip that out, we would actually be quite a bit above the mid single-digit figure and more in line with kind of the numbers we are trying to drive. So I think we are in very good shape on the cost side for FY’21. It just -- it starts out a little rough just because we have got to ramp these newer products, but for the year, it should be really good. And once we really hit our stride on 1-alpha, we are really bullish about the cost reductions there. So that’s probably not until the following year but that will start to help further.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So on the second part of your question related to NAND profitability, so as you know, NAND profitability in the industry today is low. I mean, DRAM profitability is significantly better than NAND profitability. DRAM industry is certainly exercising good discipline with respect to CapEx and that bodes well for, as we said earlier, for the industry environment as we go through calendar year 2021. On the NAND side, what we are highlighting is that, given the low profitability levels, there is a risk to improving the profitability of the industry unless demand ends up being higher than our estimations of approximately 30% the demand growth next year or the CapEx restrained on the supply side in the industry gets managed better. Of course, it is too early to comment realistically on 2020 industry supply growth, but with the current estimations that we have we believe that discipline on the CapEx side is needed in the NAND industry to restore the healthier profitability levels of NAND. Of course, on Micron’s part, as we highlighted, our strategy always is to focus on growing our supply in line with demand. That means we have -- plan to have supply growth CAGR to be in line with industry demand growth CAGR both for DRAM and NAND. And on NAND, this year, that means in calendar year 2020, our NAND supply growth will be significantly less than the industry demand given the RG transition and next year also we are continuing to exercise our CapEx discipline on NAND with our supply growth next year in ‘20 -- calendar year 2021 somewhat less than the expectation of the industry demand. Of course, in terms of shipment capability in calendar year 2021, we will be able to fulfill that in line with industry demand, using the inventory -- the higher levels of inventory that we have been carrying in NAND. So we are certainly exercising discipline and managing our transition here from floating gate to replacement gate, as well as addressing the NAND opportunities in a disciplined fashion and all I was pointing out was that that CapEx discipline is needed on the part of the NAND industry as well to restore stronger levels of profitability versus the current low levels that exist in the industry.
Ambrish Srivastava: Okay. Thank you. Thanks for the clarification. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s question-and-answer session, as well as today’s conference call. You may now conclude and disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-06-29 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to Micron Technology's Third Quarter 2020 Financial Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please be advised that today's conference may be recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Head of Investor Relations, Farhan Ahmad. Sir, please go ahead.
Farhan Ahmad: Thank you, and welcome to Micron Technology's fiscal third quarter 2020 financial conference call. On the call with me today are Sanjay Mehrotra, President and CEO; and Dave Zinsner, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will be approximately 60 minutes in length. This call, including the audio and slides is also being webcast from our Investor Relations website at investors.micron.com.

We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after today’s date to conform these statements to actual results. I'll now turn the call over to Sanjay.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Farhan. Good afternoon, everyone. I hope that you, your family and your colleagues are safe and healthy. Along with Dave and Farhan, I am doing this call from Micron’s offices.  Micron’s strong execution in the fiscal third quarter drove solid sequential revenue and EPS growth. We are ramping the industry’s most advanced DRAM node and increasing our mix of high-value NAND. Our strong competitive position and diversified product portfolio put Micron in an outstanding position for the many exciting growth opportunities in the memory and storage markets. I’ll start with an update on our operations. Due to the excellent work of Micron's operations team, most of our fab and assembly sites operated at full production throughout the quarter, with our Singapore and Taiwan assembly and test facilities achieving record production. COVID-19's impact to our production early in our third quarter was limited to our backend assembly and test sites in Muar and Penang, Malaysia, and we quickly offset this impact with production adjustments at our other facilities. All our production facilities are operating normally at this time. We continue to prioritize the health and safety of all team members and contractors and have strong COVID-19 safety measures in place at all our sites worldwide. We are taking a conservative, phased and site-specific approach to returning our team members on-site, prioritizing our manufacturing workforce and engineering teams. Now turning to the market environment. The pandemic has impacted the cyclical recovery in DRAM and NAND, causing stronger demand in some segments and weaker demand in others. Market segments driven primarily by consumer demand have seen a negative impact. Calendar 2020 analyst estimates for end-unit sales of autos, smartphones and PCs are meaningfully lower than pre-COVID-19 levels, even though estimates for enterprise laptops and Chromebooks have increased. The reduced level of global economic activity has also curtailed near-term demand. The pandemic is driving rapid change in consumer and corporate practices around the world. Consumers are significantly increasing online activity, including e-commerce, gaming and video streaming, all of which drive additional data center capacity requirements. Trends like working-from-home and online learning are likely to drive long-term changes in how we think about workforce flexibility and education. Several governments around the world are considering ways to ensure a level playing field by considering significant programs that provide Chromebooks or tablets to students who cannot afford them, as online learning becomes a necessity in these times.  Additional government fiscal stimulus programs are also supportive of economic activity and will accelerate trends like electric vehicle production. Emerging technologies such as drone-based deliveries and the increased use of robotics across many applications are now being pursued with urgency. Technology solutions are rapidly helping society adapt and manage the temporary and permanent changes stemming from this pandemic. Clearly, certain trends that would have taken 2 to 4 years to develop have been accelerated into months. It is easy to see how these changes will drive higher consumption of memory and storage in the long term. The faster pace of digital transformation in the economy is here to stay. Looking ahead to the second half of calendar 2020, let me discuss certain key market trends. First, we expect the data center outlook to remain healthy. Second, we expect smartphone and consumer end-unit sales to continue to improve, accelerating inventory consumption across the supply chain. And third, new gaming consoles will drive stronger DRAM and NAND demand.  Despite these trends, our short-term visibility across end markets remains limited due to COVID-19, macro and trade uncertainties, as well as customer inventory changes. The recent restrictions on Huawei are also impacting our opportunity in the near term. As these risks recede, we expect a resumption of industry growth, with a long-term bit growth CAGR of mid to high teens for DRAM and approximately 30% for NAND. This growth will be supported by powerful secular technology trends ranging from AI and machine learning to cloud computing, 5G and the growth in edge computing, and the industrial IoT economy. Turning to industry supply, second-half 2020 supply growth may be somewhat muted compared to pre-COVID-19 expectations. Some suppliers have commented about delays in equipment deliveries, which can result in slower node transitions and lower bit growth. Specific to Micron, we are proactively aligning our bit supply to market demand. Our fiscal year ‘20 front-end equipment CapEx is down more than 40% from fiscal year ‘19 and is at its lowest level in the last 5 years. While we expect to increase fiscal year ‘21 CapEx to support high ROIC node transitions, this CapEx will be meaningfully lower than our pre-COVID-19 plan. We have also made changes to our DRAM utilization to align with the current lower demand in the automotive market. As end-market conditions evolve, we will remain flexible to make any needed adjustments to our supply.  Since 2016, Micron has made tremendous progress narrowing the competitive gap on leading edge technology nodes. In DRAM, we are ramping 1z technology, which is the industry’s most advanced node, and achieving yield improvements that reduce our cost. We have several customer qualifications underway for this technology. Our 1y and 1z nodes together now make up more than 50% of our bit production. We continue to make progress on our 1-alpha node, which we expect to introduce in fiscal 2021. We have begun sampling our first high-bandwidth DRAM memory product, which is competitive with the industry’s most advanced products, and will expand our AI data center opportunity. We are excited about entering this new high-value segment of the DRAM market and look forward to ramping this product after it is qualified with our customers. In NAND, our 128-layer first-generation RG NAND technology entered volume production in FQ3, and we are pleased to announce that we have recently initiated customer shipments. We are also making good progress on our second-generation RG node, which will be deployed broadly across our product portfolio. We remain on track for RG production to make up a meaningful portion of our NAND output by the end of calendar 2020. Micron also continues to make progress with QLC. QLC bits now represent more than 10% of Micron’s overall NAND production, contributing to our NAND cost improvement. Fiscal 2020 has been a year of extraordinary gains in the mix of our high-value solutions in NAND, which now make up over 75% of our quarterly NAND bits. We remain on target to increase this to 80% for fiscal 2021. The new Micron is undergoing a dramatic transformation to combine product leadership with technology, manufacturing and supply chain excellence. Across our entire portfolio of DRAM and NAND products, we will continue to focus on product differentiation and portfolio expansion to grow our share of industry profits while maintaining stable bit share. Turning to end markets. We had record quarterly revenue in solid state drives, as cloud SSD revenue more than doubled quarter-over-quarter. We continue to introduce new NVMe products in our SSD portfolio, while maintaining our leadership in the enterprise SATA market. Customer qualifications are progressing well for our next-generation products for both NVMe and SATA markets. Our client NVMe SSDs have also contributed to our SSD growth. In May, we announced a TLC client SSD and our first QLC client SSD, both using next-generation 96-layered NAND technology.  As the only company with a portfolio of DRAM, NAND and 3D XPoint technologies, Micron is uniquely positioned to benefit from the secular data growth that is driving the cloud, enterprise and networking markets. Our cloud DRAM sales grew significantly quarter-over-quarter, with strong demand due to the work-from-home and e-learning economy and significant increases in e-commerce activity around the world. This quarter, we started early sampling of 1z DDR5 for enterprise applications. Additionally, we also started sampling our higher-frequency DDR4 modules for Intel’s Ice Lake server platform, which we expect to drive server DRAM content growth. In networking, our DRAM bit shipments expanded significantly on a sequential basis, driven by rapid work-from-home infrastructure deployment, as well as increased 5G deployment, particularly in Asia.  Despite demand headwinds in the smartphone market due to COVID, our mobile business delivered healthy sequential and year-over-year growth due to continuing momentum of our DRAM and NAND solutions. The outlook for calendar 2021 is promising, with 5G expected to drive a resumption in smartphone unit sales growth, with the multiplier effect of higher memory and storage content. 5G phones will have greater content than 4G phones, and we can see this already in the phones being introduced in calendar 2020. We see the strongest memory and storage content growth in the low-to-mid range part of the smartphone market, which is also the largest segment in terms of units. In this part of the market, 5G phones have 6 gigabyte of DRAM and 64 and 128 gigabyte of NAND versus 4G phones with 2 to 4 gigabyte of DRAM and 32 to 64 gigabyte of NAND. We are encouraged to see sub-$250 5G phones, which make 5G accessible to a broader market. This lower price point has been enabled by BOM cost reductions in semiconductor content outside of memory and storage. Micron is well-positioned to help our customers win in the 5G era, with an industry-leading product portfolio, including low-power DRAM and multichip packages. We continue to achieve design-ins for LP4 and LP5 5G platforms, and our most advanced managed NAND products based on UFS 3.1 are now sampling at several major Android OEMs.  In PC, our bit shipments declined modestly as we strategically moved supply of compute DRAM to address demand in the data center market. Demand was strong for certain PC sub-segments that are supporting increased work-from-home and remote learning activities, and our PC DRAM revenue was up sequentially as ASPs increased. While certain parts of the PC market have strengthened, overall PC unit shipments are expected to decline this year due to weakness in desktop PCs.  In graphics, we have started shipping GDDR6 DRAM for next-generation gaming consoles, and we expect strong demand in the second half of calendar 2020. In auto, revenue declined significantly from the previous quarter due to broad auto supply chain disruption. Despite auto unit weakness, secular content growth from ADAS and autonomous driving platforms resulted in record LP4 DRAM revenue for our auto business in fiscal third quarter. As automotive production rates improve around the world, our auto business should return to a growth trajectory. I’ll now turn it over to Dave to provide our financial results and guidance.
Dave Zinsner: Thanks Sanjay. Despite COVID-19, we achieved strong results, thanks to resilient execution from our team members across the globe. Total FQ3 revenue was approximately $5.4 billion, up 13% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. Sequential revenue growth was led by the data center and mobile markets. FQ3 DRAM revenue was $3.6 billion, representing 66% of total revenue. DRAM revenue increased 16% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. Bit shipments were up by approximately 10% sequentially. ASPs were up sequentially in the mid-single-digit percentage range. FQ3 NAND revenue was approximately $1.7 billion, representing 31% of total revenue. NAND revenue increased 10% sequentially and was up over 50% year-over-year. Bit shipments increased in the lower single-digit percentage range sequentially. ASPs increased sequentially in the upper single-digit percentage range. Now turning to our revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the Compute & Networking Business Unit was $2.2 billion, up 13% sequentially and up 7% year-over-year. CNBU sequential growth was driven by double-digit quarter-over-quarter pricing improvements and stronger demand for data center products. We were supply-constrained for certain compute DRAM products, which limited our ability to meet some demand upside from customers.  Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $1.5 billion, up 21% sequentially and up 30% year-over-year. The sequential growth was primarily driven by strong growth in our LPDRAM bit shipments. MCP revenue remained strong and was up significantly year-over-year.  Revenue for the Storage Business Unit in FQ3 was $1 billion, up 17% from FQ2 and up 25% year-over-year. SBU operating margins increased dramatically to 17%, up from a breakeven level last quarter. This significant sequential improvement in operating margins was driven by improved pricing, stronger data center SSD mix and overall record SSD revenue. And finally, revenue for the Embedded Business Unit was $675 million, down 3% sequentially and down 4% year-over-year, primarily from a reduction in automotive demand. The consolidated gross margin for FQ3 was 33.2%. Sequential gross margin improvement was driven by pricing improvements in both DRAM and NAND, as well as our ongoing improvements in product mix that continue to underpin our financial performance. The impact of underutilization at our Lehi fab was approximately $155 million or 285 basis points in FQ3. We expect underutilization to be approximately $135 million in FQ4 and expect gradual declines in underutilization through FY2021. Operating expenses were $823 million in FQ3. As we said on last quarter’s call, we’ve taken several actions to control our operating expenses, given the increased uncertainty surrounding COVID-19. As a result, we continue to expect favorable underlying OpEx trends to continue into FQ4. FQ3 operating income was $981 million, resulting in an operating margin of 18%, compared to 11% in the prior quarter and 23% in the prior year. Net interest expense increased to $24 million, compared to $6 million of net interest expense in the prior quarter. This increased expense was primarily driven by the drawdown of our revolver and subsequent $1.25 billion investment-grade note issuance in the quarter. We expect net interest expense will be approximately $30 million in FQ4, due to the decline in interest income because of lower interest rates. Our FQ3 effective tax rate was 3%, which benefited from approximately $19 million of one-time items. We expect our tax rate in the fourth quarter to be approximately 6%. Going forward into fiscal 2021, we expect our tax rate to be in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. Non-GAAP earnings per share in FQ3 were $0.82, up from $0.45 in FQ2 and down from $1.05 in the year ago quarter. FQ3 non-GAAP EPS was approximately $0.02 higher due to the tax benefits reported in the quarter. Turning to cash flows and capital spending, we generated $2 billion in cash from operations in FQ3, representing 37% of revenue. During the quarter, net capital spending was approximately $1.9 billion, approximately flat quarter-over-quarter. As we enter the final quarter of FY20, we are projecting fiscal year 2020 CapEx to be approximately $8 billion. Our FY20 front-end equipment CapEx will still be down more than 40% from last year. However, back-end CapEx and building CapEx, neither of which add to bit supply growth, are up from last year. Free cash flow in the quarter was $101 million, compared to $63 million in the prior quarter. This represents the 14th consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow, reflecting the structurally improved profitability and working capital improvements of the new Micron. We repurchased approximately 929,000 shares for $40 million in FQ3, at an average price of $43.54. In the nine months of FY20, we’ve returned $134 million of capital through repurchases and paid $266 million to settle conversion of convertible notes. Combining the convert premiums and share repurchases, we have used $338 million or 135% of FY20 free cash flow towards reducing the share count.  Ending FQ3 inventory was $5.4 billion or 131 days versus 134 days last quarter. Our overall days of inventory are above our approximately 110-day target level, partly due to elevated NAND inventory as we transition to replacement gate. We are also carrying higher raw material levels as a precaution, given the increased supply chain uncertainty due to the pandemic. We ended the quarter with total cash of $9.3 billion and total debt of $6.7 billion. Total liquidity was approximately $11.8 billion, up from $10.6 billion at the end of the second quarter. In the quarter, we issued $1.25 billion of investment-grade notes, and those proceeds, together with $1.25 billion of cash on hand, was used to repay the $2.5 billion revolving credit facility we drew at the beginning of the fiscal third quarter. Prior to providing our outlook and guidance, we’d like to remind everyone that our fiscal Q4 is a 14-week quarter. Now turning to our outlook. As Sanjay mentioned, while visibility remains limited overall, data center trends are strong, and new gaming consoles will be a tailwind to demand in the second half of the calendar year. While end unit sales of consumer devices such as smartphones have started to recover, we are seeing an impact from the recent restrictions imposed on Huawei. It is also important to remember that we are a lagging indicator relative to the end demand. In addition, the risk of a second wave of COVID-19 infections is continuing to drive greater uncertainty for the economic recovery and our business.  Lastly, inventory strategies of our customers are difficult to predict. We continue to closely monitor market conditions and respond to changes in the market environment in a timely and disciplined manner. With all of these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for FQ4 is as follows: We expect revenue to be $6 billion, plus or minus $250 million; gross margin to be in the range of 35.5%, plus or minus 150 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $850 million, plus or minus $25 million.  Finally, based on a share count of approximately 1.14 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $1.05, plus or minus $0.10. In closing, we are extremely proud of Micron’s performance in this unprecedented period of market uncertainty and operational challenges. The tenacity, creativity and dedication of our team members around the world drove strong results that surpassed our initial expectations. Micron remains on very solid footing with an investment-grade balance sheet, ever-strengthening product portfolio and secular industry trends that will continue to drive long-term demand. I’ll now turn the call over to Sanjay for closing remarks.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Dave. The pandemic has impacted our financial performance trajectory, which was shaping up for a robust outcome this calendar year. Nevertheless, we have moved with agility to leverage the new opportunities in the marketplace and have further strengthened our product portfolio. Micron’s portfolio is now dramatically better positioned from a competitive perspective, and we have driven a tremendous transformation here over the last three years.  In the coming quarters and years, we will continue to strengthen our business foundation. And as the industry environment improves, Micron is exceptionally well-positioned to take advantage of long-term trends and drive superior returns for our shareholders. Of course, preparing Micron for a bright future has to be about more than just quarterly business performance. We also have to be leaders in creating positive outcomes for all of our stakeholders. In that context, there are two topics that I would like to touch upon before we move to Q&A. First, earlier this month, we issued our fifth annual sustainability report. This year, we set challenging new goals for energy use, emissions, water use and waste generation that aim to dramatically improve the environmental sustainability of our operations worldwide over the years ahead. We also established an aspirational future vision that will drive us to achieve even more. Reaching our goals will require investment, and we plan to devote approximately 2% of annual capital expenditures to environmental sustainability initiatives, amounting to about $1 billion over the next five to seven years. These initiatives underpin our commitment to achieve significantly higher standards and help create a better planet. Second, I’d like to address the social unrest and racial division that have gripped our country. The senseless and tragic deaths of people in our black community in the U.S. must be addressed with real and lasting reforms. Hate, racial discrimination, violence and social injustice have no place in our society. Micron is committed to creating a welcoming and safe work environment for everyone, and we are taking concrete actions to increase technical training, career preparedness and opportunities for underserved population. We are also actively engaging and investing in community programs that aim to create a more just and fair society for everyone. There is much work to do, and we look forward to being part of the solution. We will now open for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Pitzer: Sanjay, David, congratulations on solid results. Sanjay, if you think back 90 days ago, when you gave guidance for the May quarter, there was a lot of uncertainty around the pandemic. And you guys guided accordingly in hindsight, extremely conservatively. I think your comment on the call last time was that you're building inventory, so you're assuming that your customers are building inventory. I guess as you look to the August quarter guide, was there a similar methodology used to inform this guide? And I guess specifically, there's a lot of consternation in the investment community about data center demand. And you seem to be arguing that in your fiscal fourth quarter remained strong and you expect it to remain strong in the calendar second half. I'm wondering if you could just share with us why you think that and why you're not as concerned as some perhaps in the investment community about inventory build?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Specifically with respect to data center, pre-COVID, we expected 2020 to be a year of strong growth in cloud. Again, with all the trends building around AI and that needing more memory and storage, we expected healthy demand for pre-COVID in cloud applications. And of course, with COVID, as we discussed in the last earnings call, certainly some of the trends got pulled in. Work-from-home economy as well as e-commerce, gaming, video streaming, all of these drove strong surge in demand on the cloud front. As we look ahead at the second half, of course, given the total COVID environment and uncertainties around COVID, around the globe, we basically have limited visibility, yet, we do believe that cloud demand in the second half of the calendar year will continue to be healthy for us. We work closely with our customers in terms of understanding their inventories. We understand what their demand trends are. And from what we can see, customer inventories with respect to cloud are in a healthy place. And of course there are other parts of the market such as mobile phones, where there are other considerations such as geopolitical considerations as well as related to COVID as well, where customers may have built up some additional inventory. And in mobile in particular, you saw in China that how in April post-COVID within China the demand went up, surged up for smartphones. So some of the customers may be preparing for -- as the consumer comes back, given the low point that the world experienced in March, April timeframe, customers wants to be prepared to supply the smartphone demand to them as well. So overall, it's a mixed picture with respect to the inventory on the customer front. Cloud inventories are in decent shape. Mobile, I would say somewhat in anticipation of demand as well as managing to the supply chain considerations due to COVID, and some geopolitical considerations as well. So overall, I would say when we look at fiscal first quarter, the environment is similar to what we have experienced in FQ3, FQ4. And of course our best assessment is baked into the guidance that we have provided to you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from CJ Muse of Evercore. Your line is open.
CJ Muse: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess a question on gross margins. How should we be thinking about mix, particularly DRAM, as we move into the August quarter? And I guess what would love to hear, as part of that, what implied cost downs will look like? And really just trying to understand, the nice step up you're seeing, how much of that is mix versus cost down versus perhaps other?
Dave Zinsner: So, well, let me step back to Q3 just for a second. So gross margins, obviously, expanded in the third quarter as well. As I said in the prepared remarks, I'd say that, that was -- the pricing environment in both DRAM and NAND combined with just a richer mix of higher value products, which obviously carry with it better gross margins. From a high value solution perspective, I think we see that again in the fourth quarter that is helping drive an improved outlook for gross margins for the fourth fiscal quarter. CJ, that we don't telegraph pricing and cost out for future quarters. But suffice it to say we take both pricing and cost reductions into account, and obviously the combination of those are pretty favorable. The other thing I would say is in the third fiscal quarter, we did have some expenses associated with COVID-19 both in terms of just increased spending on our part to manage through some disruptions that we had early on. And then on top of that, we did have to move around the back-end production that did increase our tariff expense in the third quarter. So those things we wouldn't expect to happen again in the fourth quarter, which is helping also on the gross margin front in the fourth quarter. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Your question please.
Blayne Curtis: Just on CapEx. It seems like this year, there was some concern that maybe lowered it 1 billion. I guess, when you look at next year, I don't know where your starting point was. So I was wondering if you could walk us through some of your moving pieces. You talked about 5G as being the big tailwind. That makes sense. I'm curious what you would highlight that you're taking in account for next year on the other way?
Dave Zinsner: The one thing to keep in mind is so CapEx spending this year had a fair amount of construction expense. And actually we drove the front-end equipment expense down quite considerably on a year-over-year basis. So as I said in the prepared remarks, it was down more than 40% in both DRAM and NAND. So, we cut back pretty heavily on the front-end equipment side this year. Next year, we would expect some of that to come back. In particular, we're going through a full rotation into our second-generation replacement gate that certainly will drive some cut back increases.  And offsetting that, we'll have to look at construction and see what directionally we want to do there. I think we haven't firmed up on the CapEx plans quite honestly for the year. As you know, we maintain a lot of flexibility around CapEx. We take a hard look at the demand profile of bits over the next few years and we kind of manage the front-end CapEx accordingly to make sure that we're staying aligned with that. So, over the next couple of months, we'll continue to refine our outlook over the next year or two. And I think we'll be able to give you a better picture when we have our fourth quarter earnings announcement.  I would say when we looked at coming in pre-COVID levels on CapEx front for front-end equipment, and now that we look at it now, it certainly has been cut back. And our expectation is that will impact kind of our bit supply in the calendar fourth quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur of JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Harlan Sur: Congratulations on the solid execution. Last earnings call the team highlighted the supply production shift and mix from mobile to server DRAM to service the higher demand from your data center customers. Given the outlook for stronger data center demand, are you guys keeping the production mix more heavily weighted towards server DRAM? Or are you already starting to shift part of your DRAM production mix back to mobile?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So we, of course, manage our mix on an ongoing basis. We assess customer demand expectations and make judgments regarding managing that mix. So yes, like you noted, we had shifted some of the supply from mobile towards the server applications. And at this point, we continue to make -- study how the trends are evolving and we think we are in a good position with respect to managing our mix. But, yes, some changes are needed, we will of course revert to making those changes in the future.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri of UBS. Your line is open.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Sanjay, you talked about Huawei, I think twice or maybe three times. And I know you've been reshipping under the licenses, and the new restrictions are really on ASICs, not on standard products. So, is that comment really more around the fact that this is sort of the last extension of the commerce licenses? And so you won't be able to ship to them in another three months, and can you sort of quantify how much is your Huawei exposure right now? Thanks.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So thanks for asking that question. Just to be clear, the Huawei placement on entity list, we had applied for licenses and we secured those licenses for mobile and server shipments. And we do not supply into the networking side of the business. We never sought that license. So the entity list placement that had happened several months ago did impact some of our outlook but we have been operating under the licenses that we have already received. The comments that I was making today is really related to last month's action by Commerce Department, which will go into effect sometime next month. And as a result of that action, we are already starting to see an impact in our fiscal Q4 as our customers react to the actions by the U.S. and quite frankly impact related to Huawei are still unfolding. We expect some of the impact to Huawei, yes, related to the foundries but it affects their potentially overall considerations on managing their business, managing their supply chain. And the effect of some of these impacts will continue in FQ1 and beyond as well. And then this is compounded further by changing inventory strategies at customers as well as market share shifts that happen between the smartphone players.  So as far as we are concerned, that we have improved our revenue diversity. We have significantly expanded and strengthened our product portfolio. And we have good design-in activity with all key players, particularly with new products that we have introduced, such as UFS 3.1, LP5, DRAM and multichip packages. So we continue to work with our customer ecosystem to mitigate the effects of this but the particular comments that you heard us talk about on the Huawei front really relate to the actions from U.S. government that had -- last month that has impacted customer reaction, the Huawei reaction to those actions and impacting our outlook in FQ4.
Timothy Arcuri: And I guess just how much of revenue was maybe in May? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: In the May quarter, the FQ3 quarter, that did not -- the action announced last month, did not -- action announced by the Commerce Department last month did not have an effect in FQ3.
Dave Zinsner: Now, sufficed to say that we didn’t list them as a over 10% customer. So you can make the assumption that it was below 10%.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Joe Moore: I wanted to ask about customer inventory, I want to revisit that. To the extent that customers are wrestling with pretty unprecedented potential supply challenges, do you think they're building up buffer inventory to deal with that? We've seen single earthquakes in one region cause that to hit another in the past, now we’re dealing with rolling outages across multiple continents. Do you think customers maybe building inventory. And if so, do you think memory sort of less or more impacted than other things from that? And I have a follow up. 
Sanjay Mehrotra: So what I can tell you is that Micron itself, in our supply chain operations, has focused on making sure -- given all the considerations around the globe, with all the uncertainties around COVID and COVID containment and COVID spread, Micron itself in its supply chain operations is increasing the inventory for raw materials to make sure that we are well prepared to meet our customer demand. So this trend of higher level of inventory, elevated level of inventory is being talked about and is common in the tech supply chain. And with respect to our specific customers for memory and storage, so as I mentioned earlier, so yes, some customers may have built some inventory given their considerations, their concerns around supply -- potential supply chain disruptions that may occur due to all the COVID related uncertainties as well as, as I pointed out some of the customers in the mobile may have built some inventory given U.S.-China trade tensions and the regulations. So the thing is, these are unprecedented times, uncertain times, not just for us or for the memory industry, but for our customer ecosystem as well. And customers’ inventory strategies are changing, they are adapting as they themselves see how their market trends are evolving and how they want to best address their own inventory position as well.  So this is a changing environment. We continue to work closely with our customers. And we make adjustments as appropriate. And key is to be adaptable and to be agile. And I think we have shown over the course of the first half of this calendar year that we have been really running our operations with tremendous amounts of adaptability and agility and continuing to produce healthy results.
Joe Moore: Great, thank you for that. And then in terms of the strength that you guys are seeing in the cloud in the second half, would you differentiate it all by geography? I think you mentioned China being stronger. But is it any different China versus the rest of the world in cloud?
Sanjay Mehrotra: We're not going to break it down here between China and rest of the world. But overall, when we look at it in totality, we continue to see healthy demand trend in cloud in the second half of the year.  And of course, cloud -- when you look at long-term trends, I mean, long-term cloud is still actually in early innings. And long-term trends for cloud are strong. Because AI as well as, 5G, 5G driving more intelligent devices at the edge, growing more data opportunities that really is a virtuous cycle between cloud and intelligent devices at the edge. And then industrial IoT and everything around autonomous and robotics, all of these trends point to growth at the edge as well as in the cloud.  So long-term trends continue to be healthy. Will it ever be a little bit lumpy here or there? Certainly, it can be. But the point is that long-term growth drivers are solid and secular in nature for cloud.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mitch Steves of RBC capital markets. Your line is open.
Mitch Steves: So I think you mentioned two things on the call there, I wanted to double click on. So the first one is, you mentioned that some of the shipments of semi cap didn't come in on time. So is this enough in your opinion to kind of impact the price of memory. I'm not looking for specific numbers. But was the shipment enough -- impactful enough do you think to -- or supply enough to move the price? And then secondly, just high level, any comments on the U.S. government kind of incentivizing U.S. manufacturing. So we got TSMC coming to United States and any impact you guys think it'll have on you guys in the future?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So regarding the equipment fees that you asked, let me be very clear that Micron did receive its equipment in time, because our equipment deliveries were rather early in fiscal Q3 toward our 1z technology RAM and DRAM, and of course, other aspects on demand front as well. So we did not say that equipment deliveries were delayed for us during FQ3. However, it is well known and has been talked about in the industry that given the various challenges due to COVID, such as logistics and transportation related challenges, as well as supply chain challenges, some of the equipment deliveries have been impacted in the industry. And, yes, for us in the future it is possible, given the challenges of COVID that some of our deliveries in the future may get impacted. But in the past we have been in good shape, overall, with respect to our receipt of equipment. Again because timing of most of that equipment delivery was such that we were able to actually escape some of the potential challenges in this regard.  So from a industry point of view, if equipment deliveries get impacted, which has been talked about, there have been reports, equipment suppliers have talked about some of that as well, then obviously that impacts technology transition capabilities and therefore it can impact supply, perhaps some supply growth somewhat lower than pre-COVID expectations due to the difficulty in making sure that the equipment is delivered on time as well as equipment installed and equipment RAM is happening smoothly given all the travel considerations involved as well. So yes, to the extent that affects the supply growth and lessens the supply growth, it obviously impacts the industry supply and demand environment. We've talked about the demand due to COVID in certain pockets certainly has been less, particularly those pockets related to COVID. So we didn’t really comment on the pricing but obviously supply has an important role to play on the pricing front.  Your second piece of the question regarding possible U.S. incentives for semiconductor manufacturing, let me first say that we are pleased that the U.S. administration as well as the Congress is considering incentives for the U.S. semiconductor industry. This just goes to highlight that U.S. semiconductor industry is extremely important to our economy today. Semiconductor really forms the foundation of the economy of the future, and also highlights that the recognition of this importance by the officials in Washington DC, and really it's important that U.S. maintains its global competitiveness and innovation capabilities. So from that point of view we are pleased that there are these considerations. The bill that is being put together of, course a lot of details still has to be worked out and the bills have to be approved. So we will continue to monitor this. And from the point of view of memory, I think important thing is that cost and scale in memory are extremely important considerations. Micron in this regard actually has a well diversified footprint of front-end manufacturing across the globe. You know that we have fabs here in the U.S., in Manassas, Virginia, as well as in Utah and state-of-the-art, best-in-class R&D facility in Boise, Idaho as well. And of course, we have R&D and manufacturing for memory in Asia as well.  So we will continue to monitor these trends, but important considerations are scale, cost and ROI on any investments is important. It's not just about government incentives. It's about managing the business in a healthy fashion, keeping in mind ROI considerations. And above all, it's extremely important that supply growth is managed in a cost effective fashion, but also managed in a fashion to not disrupt the industry, to certainly not disrupt Micron’s supply plans and make sure that supply CAGR is aligned with demand CAGR. So while we welcome these incentives for growth of U.S. semiconductor industry and innovation agenda, we will continue to monitor this in a very disciplined fashion before we make any decisions in this regard. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Danely of Citigroup. Your line is open.
Chris Danely : Can you just talk about the linearity of bookings during the quarter to-date, sort of build all quarter, was there some volatility in there? And then you also mentioned that mobile and data center were the strongest end markets, were both of those stronger than expected?
Dave Zinsner: So linearity of bookings was pretty -- I will call it, pretty linear through the quarter, no surprises. And the mix, of course, as we said data centers showed good strength through the quarter and mobile was a bit weaker than perhaps we were thinking coming into it, but just in terms of linearity. But in general, I would say actually a fairly linear quarter for us. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Most of the good questions have been answered. I just have a follow up. I'm just wondering, Sanjay, what would it take for your customers to feel comfortable in signing a multiyear, multi-quarter rather contract. I remember when supply was tied back in 2016 and '17, the industry was highlighted longer term contracts associated with enterprise customers. I think that has changed. And in that context how do you see this coming back and a more peculiar part of the memory industry? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: So Mehdi, you were breaking up a little bit. However your question is a good question. And of course, as you know, our customer base is extremely well diversified from automotive to data center to PC to smartphones and networking and industrial and consumer customers. So customer requirements with respect to discussions around supply -- and from us they vary. Some of the customers are managing it on monthly basis, some manage it on quarterly basis and there’s some customers we do have supply agreements that extend for a year’s timeframe. Of course, certain pricing decisions, et cetera, I mean are not part of these contracts, they tend to be around supply and discussions around pricing tend to be on an ongoing basis. Auto is an example where the contract can be multiyear contracts and long-term contracts. So, it really varies from market to market and you know that the technology and product mix continues to change as well. So, I think we want to be careful in terms of the length of the contracts that we manage with the customers and we manage I believe the diversity of our customers very well. And our customers value our supply, they are valuing the product portfolio that Micron is delivering. They are recognizing that we are the only company in the world that have NAND, DRAM and 3D XPoint and the ability to bring innovative products and solutions to them, better mix of technologies in them as well and this really positions us uniquely. So our discussions really regarding longer term nature or product roadmaps and supply considerations, weave in all of these various aspects and are built around the roadmaps as well. So things do change in this business and therefore, multiyear contracts are more in the markets that are auto market where more legacy nodes are required to be in production for longer terms. But the parts of the markets where technology and products are moving fast, it's not about multiyear contract there but in varying lengths of contracts depending on the end market customers.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman of Cowen. Your line is open.
Karl Ackerman: It's great to see the improvements in your SSD segment, both client and enterprise. First, what sort of percentage could QLC drives represent as a portion of your overall SSD mix next year, could it be 25% or more? And I'd appreciate hearing your perspective on the developments taking place in enterprise such as these. On one hand, your U.S. based competitor has been adamant, they're going to gain significant share in enterprises SSDs this year. Yet merchant controller manufacturers do enable cloud providers to design their own in-house enterprise SSDs rather than just relying off-the-shelf SSDs from OEMs. So I was hoping if you could just provide the opportunity that you see in enterprises SSDs this year versus peers, and how you see that playing out in the next 12 to 24 months, particularly as some of the new technologies that you're introducing and providing such as PCIe 4.0 becomes more mainstream? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you for asking the question. We are very pleased with our execution in SSDs as we noted that record quarter for us in SSDs and really solid sequential growth in SSDs. And this is happening as we have said before, that during calendar year 2020 we will be expanding our portfolio of SSD solutions, introducing NVMe solutions for client as well as data center markets. And we have said before that as we bring out those new solutions, as we qualify them with those customers, those NVMe solutions, it will give us an opportunity during the course of the year to gain share. And this is what has been happening during the course of this year. With our strong performance in SSDs, we actually have been gaining share. Yet our share is still relatively low and as we continue to bring out new products in the future, and several are underway and several qualifications are underway as well with our customers, we will have ongoing opportunities through the course of next year as well in terms of driving for profitable share gains in the SSD market.  And regarding QLC that you asked about, we are really pleased with our execution on the QLC front as well. We are shipping QLC SSDs in the consumer market as well as we have product offerings that we will be having, drive future opportunity for us on the value side of the PC -- on the OEM front as well. And QLC SSDs are also being used in read intensive applications and replacing 10K HDDs as well. So you see, there are multiple end market applications and opportunities for our SSDs. And we are already more than 10% of our total NAND consumption with respect to QLC and this presents a good opportunity for us. And we fully expect our SSD mix to continue to increase as we bring out more new products over the course of next several quarters.  So, yes, I mean QLC as a mix of SSD percentage will go up for us going forward. 
Karl Ackerman: Thank you. 
Sanjay Mehrotra: And let me just add that QLC is obviously an opportunity that instead of three bits per cell, it has four bits per cell. So obviously, once done right and you really have all the borne cost taken care of on the product side, it gives you lower cost and therefore improved profitability opportunity as well. So we are certainly focused on increasing the mix of QLC. At the same time, TLC will remain vast majority of the market for a considerable period of time.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Mark Newman of Bernstein. Your line is open.
Mark Newman: Hi, thanks for squeezing me in. Congrats on strong numbers today. Just as a follow up question on the data center segment, that seems to be -- and it sounds like everything you said stays very upbeat, quite bullish on data center demand remaining quite strong. There seems to be some worries in the market, particularly around some investors of hyperscalers, inventory having increased slightly. And I think the worry is stemming from what happened in 2018 with the cuts in orders in late 2018, which continued through much of 2019. So, my question is, how has the communication changed with the data center -- with the hyperscalers? You get -- are you having more frequent and closer communication with them to determine -- to try to get a better idea of what their inventory levels are? Or otherwise, how can you help kind of suit those pairs that the data center demand is going to remain stronger for longer, as we hope it will?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So first of all, I would say on the inventory side, pre-COVID data center customers as well as other customers largely had inventories that had returned to normal levels. And certainly, supplier inventories were at normal level as well pre-COVID. And in the COVID environment, work-from-home environment has driven strong surge in demand on the data center front. And as we mentioned, we expect dimensions to continue to be healthy in the second half for data center as well.  In terms of inventories in the data center market, yes while certain customers may be carrying higher levels of inventory, again for the reason that I’ve mentioned earlier related to their own supply chain considerations, as well as changing environment with respect to the demand. But the point is that compared to 2018 or 2019 environment, customer inventories are really at a much better, much healthier levels. This is not like a 2018, 2019 situation, even if certain customers are carrying some higher levels of inventory, again given the uncertainties around COVID.  And another point I would say is that while COVID does give us lower visibility, and does bring about uncertainty, not just for us, but for our customers as well, cloud is an area where the long-term dimensions, as I mentioned are secular in nature overall. So memory and storage, given the kind of applications that customers, our data center customers, hyperscalers are working on, those are requiring more memory and more storage. So the longer term trend continues to be healthy. In the near term, yes, I mean COVID does have unprecedented amount of challenges, and uncertainty in the entire tech ecosystem and we're doing our best to continue to work with our customers.  Our relationships today, since you were asking about those, are certainly lot closer than they were in the previous timeframe. I would say that even hyperscale customers have become somewhat more sophisticated in terms of understanding the memory dynamics and improving their own supply chain operations. So it's really a two-way relationship. We do work closely together with them.  Having said all of that of course, our visibility cannot be perfect in this area. We continue to focus on working closely with the customers, understanding the requirements and planning our supply chain accordingly. And what also helps is that the markets are quite diverse for us. I mean yes, cloud is a strong driver of growth for the business, but also we are well diversified with strong mobile footprint as well as PC and between DRAM and NAND. And as we talked about, diversified into the gaming side with new gaming consoles coming in, needing more DRAM, twice as much DRAM, the new gaming consoles. So diversity of the business is certainly a helpful factor for us to manage through some of these uncertainties. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Farhan. Good afternoon. I hope all of you and your families are safe. These are unprecedented times, and I am calling from home today. In Micron’s fiscal second quarter, we delivered strong results, including revenue at the high end of our guided range, even as the COVID-19 crisis began to unfold halfway through our quarter. We have now achieved positive free cash flow for 13 consecutive quarters. This performance represents a marked improvement from historical cycles and is evidence of the strength of the new Micron. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has created both operational challenges and macroeconomic concerns. Micron has more than 37,000 team members in 18 countries around the world. Since the earliest signs of the outbreak in China, we have taken proactive measures to safeguard our employees. Where possible, Micron employees are working from home, and we have suspended all local and international business travel globally. We implemented health screenings at all Micron locations. We were among the first in the industry to implement physical separation protocols at all our manufacturing sites globally to mitigate the risk of community spread, with blue teams and red teams that operate on alternate schedules. We have been requiring self-declaration and self-quarantine measures as this crisis has spread, whereby team members, contractors, and their immediate families observe 14 days of work-from-home after any air or sea travel. As of yesterday, we have two employees who have tested positive for the novel coronavirus and are receiving appropriate medical attention. At the two sites where we have confirmed cases, we have used contact tracing to quarantine individuals who were in close contact with either infected team member. We have also implemented more restrictive controls of on-site access, social distancing, and service protocols. As a result of stringent preventative measures in place, these events have not impacted our manufacturing operations thus far. We have also taken measures to protect our raw materials supply and increase our supply chain flexibility. First, we have been in close ongoing communication with our suppliers to ensure continuity and identify supply gaps. Second, we have increased our on-hand inventory of raw materials and have begun to store more of that supply on our sites to minimize the impact of any logistics delays. Third, we have increased our focus on multi-sourcing of parts to reduce supplier dependence risk. And fourth, we have added assembly and test capacity at both our captive and contract manufacturing sites to provide redundant manufacturing capability in multiple regions. As COVID-19 spreads, we are complying with all government orders at our global sites. These orders may result in a temporary or prolonged shutdown of our sites, which could impact our shipments this quarter. For example, on March 16th, the Malaysian government issued a Restriction of Movement Order, resulting in the closure of borders and most businesses in Malaysia. Subsequently, the Malaysian government added semiconductors to the list of essential services, and we were able to resume operations. Our assembly and test facilities in Muar and Penang, primarily used for packaging high-value NAND, were briefly shut down and have since been able to return to production on a very limited basis, in compliance with local regulations.  We are using our global supply chain network and increased flexibility to try and mitigate this production impact, and we are working to keep our commitments to our customers. Turning now to COVID-19 effect on demand. COVID-19 is significantly impacting China’s economic growth in the calendar first quarter, reflected in the sharp decline of smartphone and automobile unit sales. Weaker sell-through of consumer electronics and our customers’ factory shutdowns in China were headwinds for us late in our fiscal second quarter. In China, lower consumer demand was offset by stronger data center demand due to increased gaming, e-commerce, and remote-work activity. Looking to the third quarter, as these trends also take shape worldwide, data center demand in all regions looks strong and is leading to supply shortages. In addition, we are seeing a recent increase in demand for notebooks used in the commercial and educational segments to support work-from-home and virtual learning initiatives occurring in many parts of the world. We are also encouraged to see manufacturers in China increasingly returning to full production, and we have recently started to see China smartphone manufacturing volumes recover. Nevertheless, as the world deals with the outbreak of COVID-19, we expect that overall demand for smartphones, consumer electronics, and automobiles will be below our prior expectations for the second half of our fiscal 2020. Once the U.S. and other major economies have demonstrated containment of the virus’ spread, we expect a rebound in economic activity. Much depends on potential government stimulus and the rate, pace, and effectiveness of containment efforts. We are modeling an improvement in the trajectory of economic activity later into the second half of calendar 2020, with a further rebound in economic momentum into 2021. This is a very fluid situation, and we will learn more about the virus, its spread, and its economic impact over the next few weeks and months. Anticipating changes to our customer demand, we have been moving supply from smartphone to service the strength in data center markets for both DRAM modules as well as SSDs. Just like we have increased our raw materials inventory in these uncertain times, it is possible that certain customers are similarly increasing their inventory of DRAM and NAND products. We will manage our business with prudent and proactive action and continue to work closely with customers to understand their latest demand outlook. We are evaluating our production levels and CapEx plans for calendar 2020 and will adjust to the most recent demand requirements. Once we emerge from this low-visibility environment that is impacted by COVID-19, we expect the industry to resume its long-term growth trajectory with a DRAM demand growth CAGR in the mid-to-high teens and NAND in the 30% range. For both DRAM and NAND, we expect our multiyear supply growth CAGR to be in line with the industry’s demand growth CAGR. Focusing on 2020, we returned our DRAM operations to full utilization at the beginning of the calendar year, and our NAND operations continue to run with reduced wafer starts as we deploy capital efficiently through our conversion to replacement gate. While we returned our DRAM utilization to full production, we remain flexible to adjusting these levels depending on the near-term demand environment. Node transitions and industry supply growth in calendar 2020 could be impacted by disruptions to equipment companies’ operations, including travel restrictions hindering field service and engineering support. Recently, some equipment companies have also indicated delays in equipment deliveries due to the impact of various government actions to combat COVID-19. The situation with coronavirus is rapidly evolving, and disruptions could be much larger than we can see today. However, our continued focus on innovation and execution, combined with our rock-solid balance sheet puts us in an excellent position to navigate this period of uncertainty and capitalize on the long-term opportunities driving our industry once conditions eventually normalize. Stepping away from the COVID-19 discussion, I want to spend a few minutes talking about the tremendous progress we have made on our technology and products. This progress is contributing to the underlying strength of a new Micron and is a source of excitement for us as we look to the future. The new Micron is undergoing a dramatic transformation to combine product leadership with technology, manufacturing and supply chain excellence. Our objective is to have leading process technology so that we can deliver differentiated products to our customers and maintain a competitive cost structure. We are making good progress on this front in both DRAM and NAND. In DRAM, we were the first to introduce 1Z in volume production and expect over half of our bit production to be on 1Y and 1Z by the summer of 2020. We are managing the construction schedule of our new Taiwan cleanroom expansion carefully and currently remain on target for first output in calendar 2021. In the fiscal second quarter, we began sampling 1Z-based DDR5 modules and are on track to introduce high-bandwidth memory in calendar 2020. We are also making good progress on our 1-alpha node. In NAND, we made significant progress on our replacement gate, or RG, transition and expect to begin volume production in our current quarter, with revenue shipments to follow in our fiscal fourth quarter. We expect replacement gate production to be a meaningful portion of our total NAND supply by the end of this calendar year. Micron continues to lead on QLC NAND, which lowers costs for SSDs and helps us target market segments that are currently served by HDDs. QLC SSD bit shipments rose by 60% sequentially in our fiscal second quarter, with a meaningful portion of our consumer SSDs now shipping with our QLC technology. We expect QLC to continue growing in the second half of the fiscal year as market adoption increases. In the fiscal second quarter, we made significant progress on increasing the mix of high-value NAND bits to over 70% of total NAND bits, and we remain on track to drive this figure to around 80% in fiscal 2021. Despite normal seasonal weakness and COVID-19, mobile MCP products had record revenue in the quarter and showed strong sequential growth. SSD revenue also grew approximately 20% sequentially, led by greater than 50% growth in data center SSDs. The resolution of the assembly and test constraints we experienced in the fiscal first quarter, combined with market share gains, drove strong growth in these product lines. This mix improvement increases our profitability and reduces the volatility in our margins. Now let's turn to 3D XPoint. As the only company in the world with a portfolio of DRAM, NAND and 3D XPoint technologies, Micron is uniquely positioned in the marketplace. We are encouraged by the customer reception of our first 3D XPoint product, the X100, which is the fastest storage device in the world. It is a great start to our portfolio of differentiated 3D XPoint products built in collaboration with our customers. As we mature this X100 solution, we look forward to engaging a broader set of customers this year and delivering the value of 3D XPoint to the data center market. Early in March, we entered into a new 3D XPoint wafer sale agreement with Intel that replaces previous agreements. Intel has been an important partner over the years, and this new agreement ensures a continuation of our close relationship. Now, turning to highlights by products and markets. In SSDs, we had record consumer SSD revenue assisted by growth of our QLC NVMe consumer SSDs. We expect strong sequential bit growth in our NVMe product portfolio in fiscal third quarter as we continue the transition from SATA to NVMe. In SATA, we achieved several customer qualifications for our newest 96-layer SATA-based data center SSD. In the fiscal second quarter, we became the first company to deliver LP5 mobile DRAM products to customers, including Xiaomi, which is using our LP5 in its 5G-capable Mi 10 smartphones in 8GB and 12GB configurations. More recently, we have begun sampling the world's first LP5 DRAM-based UFS MCPs. These LP5 DRAM products will enable longer smartphone battery life and high-performance image processing. They are great examples of how Micron is innovating for our customers to enhance the end-user experience. We are encouraged that LP5 and UFS will become even more important as 5G adoption accelerates, reigniting smartphone unit sales and driving content growth. In just two short years, we have gone from trailing the competition in our mobile product portfolio to leading the industry with innovative, first-of-a-kind products, consistent with our new Micron strategy. In the data center market, we benefitted from strong demand for our products from key cloud and enterprise customers, driven in part by ongoing strength in cloud markets, increased use of online properties such as e-commerce, and the surge in remote-work requirements due to COVID-19 containment measures. In the graphics market, GDDR6 bit shipments increased more than 40% quarter-over-quarter, and we anticipate strong growth with the launch of new gaming consoles that are expected to feature 16 gigabyte of GDDR6. These new consoles will also deploy SSDs in place of hard drives for the first time. In the PC market, DRAM bit shipments and revenue declined sequentially, driven by slow seasonal demand and continued CPU shortages. Our client SSD sales also declined sequentially. In the automotive market, we delivered record DRAM and NAND revenue despite soft global automobile unit sales, as content growth remains strong in this market. Micron continues to lead the auto market with the industry’s highest-quality products. Power efficiency is increasingly important in the auto market, creating an opportunity for Micron to leverage our strength in low-power DRAM. LPDRAM now makes up approximately half of our auto DRAM revenue. In the industrial market, we had record bit shipments for both DRAM and NAND. In the longer term, we expect secular growth in the industrial IoT market as 5G rolls out and increases the importance of AI, machine learning and compute at the edge. I’ll now turn it over to Dave to provide our financial results and guidance.
Dave Zinsner: Thanks Sanjay. We executed well in fiscal second quarter, and our reported financial results largely came in at the high end of our guidance ranges, despite the uncertainty and impacts related to COVID-19. Prior to the advent of COVID-19, we had outlined our expectation that FQ2 would mark the low point of our financial performance in this cycle, and our business trajectory has been consistent with those expectations. While we still expect improvements in our financial results, these expectations now need to reflect the evolving impacts of COVID-19. As Sanjay said, the situation remains fluid, and we continue to assess our plans and make real-time changes to adapt and optimize our operations. Total FQ2 revenue was approximately $4.8 billion, the high end of the guidance we provided for the quarter. Revenue was down 7% sequentially and down 18% year-over-year. FQ2 DRAM revenue was $3.1 billion, representing 64% of total revenue. DRAM revenue declined 11% sequentially and 26% year-on-year. Bit shipments were down byapproximately10% sequentially and up more than 20% on a year-on-year basis. ASPs were flat sequentially. FQ2 NAND revenue was approximately $1.5 billion, or 32% of total revenue. Revenue increased 6% sequentially and was up 9% year-on-year. Bit shipments declined in the low-single-digit percentage range sequentially and increased approximately 20% year-on-year. ASPs increased in the upper single-digit percentage range sequentially. Now, turning to our revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the Compute & Networking Business Unit was approximately $2 billion, down approximately1% sequentially and down 17% year-over-year. We have now started to include all 3D XPoint revenue in CNBU reporting, as the use cases for 3D XPoint technology are more closely aligned with memory expansion and this business is being managed by CNBU. Excluding 3D XPoint, CNBU revenue would have been down 7% sequentially, primarily driven by weaker sales in the PC market. Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $1.3 billion, down 14% sequentially and down 22% year-over-year. The sequential decline was primarily driven by seasonality in certain products, as well as our decision to walk away from some business due to our concerns regarding pricing. Revenue for the Storage Business Unit in FQ2 was $870 million, down 10% from FQ1 and down 15% year-over-year. Without 3D XPoint, SBU revenue was up 9% sequentially. Operating profit margins for SBU improved sharply in the quarter and were at approximately breakeven levels. And finally, revenue for the Embedded Business Unit was $696 million, down 5% sequentially and down 13% year-over-year. The consolidated gross margin for FQ2 was 29.1%, exceeding the high end of the guidance range. The quarter-over-quarter margin improvement was driven by portfolio mix improvements and NAND pricing, and approximately $50 million of benefit came from the NAND depreciable life change we made in the prior quarter. The impact of underutilization at our Lehi fab was approximately $142 million or 295 basis points in FQ2. We expect underutilization to be approximately $160 million in FQ3. We are continuing our efforts to reduce spending in our Lehi fab, which we expect will begin to materialize in fiscal 2021. Operating expenses were $856 million in FQ2. Given the increased uncertainty, we have taken additional steps to control our OpEx. These actions include freezing our near-term hiring and cutting back significantly on discretionary spending. As a result, we expect OpEx to decline sequentially in FQ3. For modeling purposes, our FQ4 will be a 14-week quarter. As a result, we expect an uptick in operating expenses for FQ4 that is consistent with the extra week in the quarter. FQ2 operating income was $542 million, representing 11% of revenue. Operating margin was nearly flat compared to the prior quarter. Net interest expense was $6 million, compared to $7 million of net interest income in the prior quarter. Since the Federal Reserve has cut short-term interest rates, we anticipate lower interest income on our cash balance for FQ3. With increased debt from the drawdown of our revolver, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $35 million in FQ3, and it will likely be modestly higher in FQ4 with a full-quarter impact of the lower interest income. Our FQ2 effective tax rate was 3.2%. For the remainder of FY20, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 5%. We expect our long-term tax rate to be in the high-single-digit to low-double-digit range. Non-GAAP earnings per share in FQ2 were $0.45, down modestly from $0.48 in FQ1 and $1.71 in the year-ago quarter. Turning to cash flows and capital spending. We generated $2 billion in cash from operations in FQ2, representing 42% of revenue. During the quarter, net capital spending was approximately $1.9 billion, up slightly quarter-over-quarter. We are continuing to project FY20 CapEx in the range of $7 billion to $8 billion, including some increases for assembly and test flexibility that Sanjay mentioned. Free cash flow in the quarter was $63 million compared to $86 million in the prior quarter. This marks the 13th consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. Our ability to generate cash consistently through the cycle is largely the result of the structural improvements made to Micron's profitability, which has led to more than $1.5 billion of operating cash flow improvement and more than 25 percentage points of operating cash flow improvement compared to the trough quarter of the prior cycle. We repurchased approximately 785,000 shares for $44 million in FQ2. In the first half of fiscal 2020, we've returned $94 million of capital through repurchases, representing approximately 65% of our free cash flow. Ending FQ2 inventory was $5.2 billion or 134 days. The increase was expected and largely due to the seasonally weaker demand experienced in FQ2 combined with our strategy of holding more NAND inventory as we approach our transition to replacement gate later in the calendar year. We have also increased our raw material levels as a precaution, given increased uncertainty in the supply chain with these materials. As we had outlined on our prior earnings call, we continue to walk away from unfavorably priced business, which also added to our near-term inventory levels. We ended the quarter with total cash of $8.1 billion and total liquidity of approximately $10.6 billion. FQ2 ending total debt was $5.4 billion. To preserve ready access to our liquidity in a period of macroeconomic uncertainty, early this quarter, we drew $2.5 billion from our revolving credit facility. Now, turning to our outlook. Based on our conversations with our customers, the demand for our products remains strong and the pricing trends are favorable. However, it is important to note that we are a lagging indicator relative to end demand, and macro projections have significantly weakened in the near-term. It is also currently unclear the extent to which inventory builds related to COVID supply concerns might be masking weakness in end demand. In addition, we also face the continued risk of production and logistics disruptions due to government actions, labor and material shortages, and to travel and border restrictions. Given these unusual uncertainties, our guidance ranges are wider than usual. However, these wider ranges do not reflect the magnitude of all the risks, and results could vary significantly from these ranges. Our guidance ranges also include expenses for COVID-19 mitigation efforts. With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for FQ3 is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.6 billion to $5.2 billion, gross margin to be in the range of 31%, plus or minus 150 basis points, and operating expenses to be approximately $825 million, plus or minus $25 million. Finally, based on a share count of approximately 1.14 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $0.55, plus or minus $0.15. In closing, notwithstanding the near-term uncertainty, we are pleased with Micron's financial execution exiting this cyclical downturn. FQ2 revenue was approximately 65% higher and gross margins 11 percentage points higher than in the prior trough, which occurred in FQ3 of 2016. This revenue growth far outpaced the growth of the overall semiconductor industry in this period. As we assess our cross-cycle performance from the last trough to this trough, we have delivered average returns as follows: Gross margins of more than 40%; EBITDA margins of 50%; CapEx to revenue in the 30s; and return on invested capital exceeding 20%. While the near-term business environment is uncertain, we believe that long-term demand trends for Micron remain robust. Our focus on execution, our strong product portfolio and our solid balance sheet ensure that Micron is in the best position to capitalize on the secular trends driving our business. I’ll now turn the call over to Sanjay for closing remarks.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Dave. I want to close by thanking our extraordinary Micron team around the globe. These recent weeks have placed unforeseen challenges on businesses, but more importantly on people and families. Micron’s team has responded with professionalism and care during this period, and our team members are the reason we can execute our business plan and deliver the strong results we have reported today. To assist during this period, we are offering U.S. team members earning less than $100,000 per year a special onetime payment of $1,000. These figures are adjusted for market rates worldwide and 68% of our team is eligible. In addition, we are establishing an emergency relief fund for employees facing financial hardship. We are also focused on assisting the communities in which we operate through this difficult time. As part of that effort, we are contributing an additional $10 million through the Micron Foundation to address the impact of COVID-19, on top of what we have already donated in China, Italy and the U.S. We are also working with local officials to make space in our facilities available if needed for emergency services, as well as providing support through our supply chain operations to help source needed screening and protective equipment. Finally, we are accelerating our payment terms to our small business vendors to help with their liquidity. I’ve said many times that the new Micron is stronger than ever, and we are showing that strength today. Micron is leveraging our core expertise to drive leadership in technology, products and manufacturing, delivering differentiated solutions that enrich life for end-customers around the world. While the near-term environment creates uncertainty for all of us in our daily lives, the long-term fundamentals of our industry are strengthening and opportunities are expanding. With these opportunities in front of us, we will continue to execute with tenacity and resilience as we make demonstrable progress towards our vision. We will now open for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. 
Joe Moore: Great, thank you. Dave, in your prepared remarks, you talked about inventory accumulation potentially masking weakness of customers. Where specifically might you have that anxiety? It seems like you think conditions are pretty strong and your customers don't seem to have a lot of lease end product inventory. So is that just a precautionary remark on your side or is there something that you're seeing that creates anxiety? 
Sanjay Mehrotra: I'm sorry. I was just going to say, let me address that first and then I will definitely have Dave expand on that. So, it is an environment where there can be supply shortages, and of course, underlying demand trends in the markets we are participating continue to be strong. There can be supply shortages given the fluid situation related to the spread of coronavirus in various countries, the rate and pace is different. And ultimately, it will depend upon the rules and regulations that different governments may impose, that can potentially impact supply in the industry. So, just like we are accumulating some inventory ourselves to make sure that we don't have supply disruptions, it is legitimate to think that our customers can also be building some inventory to make sure that their supply chain is under control. So, I think this is the part that we are just mindful of. Although, when you look at work-from-home economy and study-from-home economy for students, that is certainly driving greater demands in the enterprise PC side and certainly placing – addresses quite a bit of constraints and stress on the infrastructure. So, the cloud infrastructure, the enterprise infrastructure definitely is driving increased demand as well. So, in that backdrop, I think, we are just being mindful in terms of making those comments, but I will let Dave further elaborate on this. 
Dave Zinsner: Yes. I think what you covered, Sanjay, is good. The only thing I'd add is, I think, we believe the strength in the data center market is real, and the inventory levels are normal in that market.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from Timothy Arcuri of UBS. 
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I guess Sanjay, there was some language in the release that you guys have talked about the fact that you're lagging indicator relative to demand. Can you just help parse through that? I guess, it sounds like maybe you're suggesting that the fiscal fourth quarter could be maybe down sequentially, which is typically up. I know that it's very difficult to tell what's going on right now, but maybe can you just help us walk through what the puts and takes look like into Q4? I know you don't want a guide Q4, but it sounds like it's possibly down. So, can you just help us think about that? Thanks.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, certainl,y as you know, Tim, we are not guiding to Q4 here. And of course, the environment is fluid. These are unprecedented times in terms of anybody dealing any business, any vertical, or any country dealing with the situation and the spread and containment of coronavirus. But what I would say here is that with respect to our own assessment of the demand trends, I think underlying demand trends definitely continue to be healthy. And when we look at what we supply to our customers, customers build it into the product if there has to be any macroeconomic weakness, and we know that in the environment of coronavirus pandemic, there will be some impact on some aspects of the consumer demand. The consumer demand, there's a lag between the consumer demand getting impacted to the demand from our customers who are building the product in their supply chain is getting impacted. So, that's what we mean that sometimes there can be a lag between what we are supplying to our customers versus the impact on the demand in the marketplace. So, we are not guiding to fourth quarter. I think what's important is that it will depend on the spread of the virus, the containment of virus. Different countries may have their containment at different rates. So, while we have seen, for example, last fiscal quarter, our FQ2, demand in China and the consumer demand and the smartphone demand declined, we have also seen that China has contained this; and in fact, production is coming back in China and the demand is being restored in China. Same thing will happen in other parts of the world as well, but while there may be some impact on smartphone demand in different countries, eventually as the containment happens, the consumer demand will be back. And the long-term trends, certainly for our business are strong. The trends of 5G driving greater content in smartphone. When we come back on the other side of this pandemic, there will be -- the demand drivers will reassert themselves. Similarly, cloud demand continues to do well. As I mentioned, the COVID-19 scenario may actually be accelerating some of that demand in cloud that is driving greater demand for memory and storage. So, point is, the situation is fluid and we are really not prepared to guide you to FQ4 at this point.
Operator: Next question comes from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer: Thanks for all the details, especially given how uncertain the environment is. I'm just kind of curious, Sanjay and Dave, is it possible to quantify what the impact of COVID was in the February quarter? And more importantly, is there a number in mind for May? It's clear, the uncertainty is increasing the range for the May guide, but is it also bringing down the midpoint? Any sort of guidance of how you're thinking through that would be very helpful.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, I will let Dave address that. 
Dave Zinsner: Okay. Yes, sure. So, maybe without throwing out a number, because it's difficult to estimate, clearly we would have been above the high-end of the range on revenue if not for COVID-19, and there were some mitigation expenses already in both cost of sales and operating expenses that impacted us a bit in fiscal second quarter as well. We would have likely been more skewed to a higher growth number for fiscal third quarter, if not for COVID-19. And of course, it’s somewhat unusual for us we widened the range by a couple of hundred million dollars also to account for the uncertainty, as it relates to what might happen not only from a demand perspective but from a supply perspective, either one has some risk to it. Additionally, we have built in more costs associated with COVID mitigations for us. Sanjay and I already talked about the fact that we're carrying higher levels of inventory of raw materials. But, we're also having to flex our supply chain back -- and have some redundancy that can drive up some expenses on the cost of sale side. In addition, we may see an increased level of tariff expense in an effort to mitigate some supply disruptions that might occur. And also, there's a fair amount of expense associated with just the work-from-home model and allow -- enabling our employees to be able to do all the work they do in the offices, now in their homes. And so, there's some expense associated with that. So, our expense might -- likely would have been  likely would have been down even more, particularly with all the actions we've taken to reduce expenses, if not for the fact that we have a bit of this offset or headwind associated with the mitigation expenses in the third quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from C.J. Muse of Evercore. Your line is open.
C.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. And great to hear that you're safe and well. I guess, my question is, regarding the supply side, particularly for DRAM. You talked about some issues related to equipment installation and part availability. You've also talked about switching over some of your capacity from mobility to server. So curious, as you think that through, what does bit production look like now, either for you or for the industry here in calendar '20? I think, we were all thinking kind of 6% to 8% coming in. Is that still the right number, or is there a change there? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, I think what we had said before the COVID-19 scenario that in calendar year '20, the DRAM demand growth would be in mid-teens around mid-teens and that supply would be somewhat less for the year -- supply growth would be somewhat less for the year than the demand growth. And, of course, as we look at the scenario of supply growth, technology transitions, the node transitions in the industry perhaps can be impacted by tool deliveries or the engineering or the service support in the industry. It’s too soon to tell this. But, the point is that there could be some impact to supply, and not just related to the wafer output, but there could be some impact to the supply, as I said before, depending upon the rules and regulations in the orders in various countries where the supply chain for memory and storage exists. If those orders impact any production, there could be some supply growth impact there as well. It's hard to tell at this point. And we certainly -- when we look at our current supply growth, our current supply growth at this point is intact, but we are mindful of the changes that could occur due to the COVID environment. And of course, we continue to watch the demand as well. And on the supply side, we will take action. Today, we have shortages in supply as we have mentioned for server, DRAM as well as for cloud. Overall, there are shortages for DRAM. And therefore, we are shifting some of the supply from mobile to the DRAM side. But of course, we continue to keep track of what the demand looks like. And as we said, we will evaluate, making reductions in our production utilization or in terms of any CapEx aspects to manage the supply growth during the calendar year '20. But, it's too soon to really give you any specific projections on that.
Operator: Thank you. And next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. David or Sanjay, can you please tell me how you think of the mix of revenue from China, especially going back to what Sanjay said earlier. China is resuming operation. They're also providing incentives for 5G adoption. And I'm just curious how China accounted for your revenues in the February fall and how you see it trending for the remainder of the year?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, I will let Dave answer that.
Dave Zinsner: So, I think, cumulative revenues, I’ll have to go back and look at the exact statistics, but it was somewhere in the kind of 30%, I think it was China revenue in aggregate. Clearly, as you said, there's a comeback to work kind of phenomenon going on in China and there is economic stimulus. So that certainly will benefit. But, we're -- also the customers in the U.S. are -- a lot of them are in the cloud space. And of course, that's a big driver of our business today, given as Sanjay mentioned, the move to work-from-home and e-commerce and so forth. So, I'm not sure that the mix, as we project it is likely to shift around significant, geographically.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava of BMO.
Ambrish Srivastava: I had a question on capacity and cost per bit. What percent of your CapEx is flexible? And I appreciate that things are so fluid, it's very hard for you to tell us how much you're going to -- you expect. But just as a ballpark, what percentage? And then, is the cost down going to change based on what you know as of now versus what you told us last quarter for both NAND and for DRAM?
Sanjay Mehrotra: In terms of CapEx, we -- for our fiscal third quarter, these won’t be impacting the CapEx for fiscal third quarter. However, for the rest of the calendar year '20, we certainly will be, as I said before, evaluating our CapEx, as well as our production utilization to make sure that our supply stays in line with our demand expectations. Demand expectations, of course, we laid out, working closely with our customers. So, just like in 2019, we made changes to CapEx fairly rapidly and we reacted fast, as well as we managed our production. We will of course be doing the same thing here. Just keep in mind that the situation with respect to coronavirus escalation across the globe just has really evolved rapidly over the course of last couple of weeks. So, we will of course keep close tabs with our customers’ demand expectations, and we will make sure that we make any adjustments to our CapEx, if needed, accordingly. We are absolutely continuing to look at that. And in terms of cost reductions, of course, cost reductions are a function of technology transitions that are being made in the fabs. And so far, we are on plan with respect to the cost guidance that we have provided to you for our fiscal year '20.
Dave Zinsner: I would add that on the NAND front, as you seen, we've gotten a fair amount of benefit from the change in depreciation in the first half of fiscal '20. So that, in essence, kind of pulled ahead. As you remember, probably, we mentioned that as we transition the replacement gate, FY20 would show minimal cost decline and really FY21 was where we would see it. But with the depreciation change, the reality of what's happening is we're kind of pulling ahead some of that improvement into fiscal '20. So, when you look at the percentages, it's better in FY20, and maybe not as good as we originally kind of telegraphed, in FY21. And in addition, what we continue to drive is mix to the high value solutions. They generally carry higher costs. And we hope to continue that. Our goal is to get to 80%. So, that certainly will also be an impact on the cost side as well. But, if you step back and then look at how we do over a multiyear period in terms of NAND improvement, once we're really running on the second generation replacement gate and good momentum, we're up to the right yield, it’s running through the inventory and showing up in cost of sales. And you see that over a multiyear period, you'll see that arc declining costs over a multiyear period is actually very good, very healthy, very competitive.
Sanjay Mehrotra: And I would just add that due to COVID-19, as we said that we are enabling greater flexibility in our supply network, by adding captive capacity as well as adding capacity on part of our subcontractors to give us the opportunity and resiliency in the supply chain in case there are rules and regulations in various countries that impact our production. So, some of those aspects certainly do have headwinds on the cost side, but by and large, I think those are being managed well. And overall, our cost targets for fiscal year '20 at this point are on track.
Operator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo.
Aaron Rakers: I want to go back to the customer inventory dynamics and trying to understand or appreciate how you think about that potential buildup of inventory. Can you help us understand whether you've implemented anything differently or have different lines of visibility into those customers? How you exactly plan on managing or seeing any kind of inventory build, particularly at some of the cloud customers?
Sanjay Mehrotra: I mean, we certainly work closely with those customers. Our relationships over time have only deepened with those customers. We have become more valuable partner to them, as well as we have expanded our product offering. For example, on the SSD side, we have brought out NVMe SSDs. Those are getting qualified in data center. On the DRAM side, we have been a strong partner with highest quality with those customers. And on the cloud side, still, in the very, very early innings of all the growth and for memory and storage and cloud. So, compared to the last cycle, our relationships with those customers have only expanded, have deepened. We continue to work closely with them in terms of understanding their demand requirements. And this is what the best that we can do in terms of working closely with those customers who understand the requirement. And I would like to once again point out that we are in an environment even before COVID-19 that CapEx investments in cloud were on a strong growth trajectory, a lot of that CapEx moving toward the infrastructure for memory and storage requirements. Of course, new CPU architectures with more cores in them, as well as more channels giving you greater attachment for memory and storage and of course, the workloads that are demanding more DRAM memory for memory intensive compute application, as well as for faster access, driving more SSDs. So, those demand trends pre-COVID were already strong. And with COVID if anything we have seen that work-from-home digital economy is driving greater demand on that structure and is accelerating some of that demand. So, we of course -- as we work through the memory shortages, we continue to work closely with our customers. And while the smartphone demand maybe somewhat down, for example, in China in FQ2, but that demand is coming back in China. And we will continue to monitor these trends in the other parts. And it just requires continuing to work closely with the customers, understanding the requirements, and are applying our own judgment and remaining mindful in terms of how we manage all our supply. So, it's really customer relationship in terms of managing our supply, growth and understanding the demand expectation.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. And thank you for taking my question. Strong memory demand driver in the second half of this year, as you pointed out, is the new game console refresh. I think there's 35% to 100% more GDDR DRAM memory versus prior generations platforms and the move to SSD storage versus HDD. Given your leadership in graphics DRAM, we know that the Micron team will be participating here on these new consoles. But given your good NVMe client SSD positioning, is the team also participating in the console refresh with either your band or your SSD products?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Certainly as we expand our portfolio of SSDs, yes, we just maybe just had SATA. Now, we have NVMe SSDs as well and we're broadening our reach with those NVMe SSDs into the end market applications as well as the customers. Certainly, it is a growth market opportunity for us, not only in DRAM but also in SSDS. But as you know, these take product qualifications with the customers and then we are able to realize the benefit of sales and revenue growth in those areas. I want to highlight here that as we have expanded our product portfolio, both on the SSD side as well as in mobile on multichip packages, and bringing out discrete UFS products for mobile applications as well. That really has enabled, as I mentioned in the script, opportunity for us to gain share in the marketplace. We have gained share in NAND, managed NAND solutions in mobile, we have gained share in SSDs as well, that's enabling us to deliver healthy results in FQ2, and our gain in share and expanding product portfolio also positions us well to navigate through these choppy waters related to COVID-19. And we remain very-focused on continuing to expand the product portfolio and broaden our customer relationships in the kind of applications that you just talked about in gaming consoles, both for DRAM and NAND as we look forward to the future long-term secular demand trends and addressing those requirements by our customers.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mitch Steves of RBC Capital Markets Your line is open.
Mitch Steves: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. So, impressive guidance there. One of the questions I did have though, just the offset of kind of commercial PCs coming back and more people are working from home, offset by kind of the smartphone unit demand. So, how are you guys thinking about that for the rest of the calendar year? Obviously, there is a lot of moving parts, but just how do you guys track kind of the lower expected sales prices probably in the handset side versus commercial PC upgrades from people work-from-home. 
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, yes, that's correct. I think, there is a near-term surge in demand with respect to commercial PCs. I mean, if you look at just Micron itself, Micron itself bought something like 5,000 notebook computers to really provide it to our team members in terms of enabling them to work-from-home and we’ve implemented those really very, very fast. So yes, surge in demand related to enterprise PCs and that bodes well for both SSDs, as well as for DRAM. And as we noted also with respect to virtual learning and students learning from home that also drives demand in notebooks. How long this trend lasts, and of course, it is global in nature. But, how long does it last? We will have to see. But overall, yes, I mean, we do see that. While there may be some smartphone, the weakness outside of China, while China is recovering on the smartphone front. Certainly, as I said, enterprise PCs and other PCs for virtual learning along with data demand in the data center world is a tailwind for us.
Operator: And next question comes from Raji Gill of Needham & Company.
Raji Gill: Just another question on the demand conditions. I think, David mentioned in his prepared remarks that the macro conditions had weakened in the last couple of weeks. And you talked about some of the moving pieces of that. If we try to quantify that, the impact, DRAM is about 70% of your revenue, NAND is 30%. What percentage of DRAM is coming from PCs, hyperscalers, mobile and likewise on the NAND side, so we can just kind of get a sense of where the potential strengths and weaknesses could be?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, we don't break it down specifically in terms of percentage, but I think what's important is that we are a very well diversified supplier. And we have a broad portfolio and end market applications are well diversified as well all the way from data center to PC to smartphone, networking for DRAM. And Micron is well-positioned in these markets. And certainly some of these markets are seeing some shortages today, such as on the side of data center, DRAM requirements. And while others, we are continuing to monitor overall demand spend. But we don't break it out. But, important thing is that the underlying vectors for demand are good. And as we goes through the uncertainties related to COVID-19, when he come out on the other side, I'm very confident that our broad portfolio and deep customer engagement and the technology and product capabilities, I think we will overall do just fine. By and large, our mix is fairly similar to the industry in terms of overall mix. If you look at the industry, I think you'll see that server is in the 25% to 30% range, the mobile tends to be around 25%, PC is 20% give or take some, and of course then is all the others, which we can call like specialty, which includes automotive, includes industrials and other applications. And in that you can I think put down around 20%. So, I think, roughly speaking, I think that’s the kind of mix. And as you can see, it’s well diversified across these various end market segments.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Danely of Citigroup.
Chris Danely: I guess, just a follow-up on some other folks’ questions. So, you talked about the demand forecast or things changing in the last couple of weeks? Can you just give us a sense of what you've seen in the last couple of weeks? And then, also for your -- sort of your forward forecasting, whether it’s internal or what you're giving us, are you shaving down what your internal forecast is in anticipation of some more weakness, or is this kind of like, what we see is what we have?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, I think, as Dave mentioned in his prepared remarks that we see strong demand and favorable price trends, but we are also seeing that in China, as is well known that during the timeframe of our fiscal second quarter, aligned with the COVID-19 spread in China, starting from around mid-January kind of timeframe, it had impacted smartphone demand in China, while it grew the demand in the could infrastructure structure in China. So, as now over last couple of weeks, you see the spread of coronavirus across the globe and various actions being taken in various countries to contain the spread of coronavirus, we do expect that there will be some impact on the consumer demand, but it is really too soon to quantify that. And, again, having said that, we also see increasing demand coming from the cloud side, as well as from enterprise PC applications. So we are seeing acceleration of demand on that front. So, we are continuing to really manage that. And this is all escalating over the last couple of weeks. And we will, of course, continue to work closely with our customers to understand their increases in demand, as well as their demand outlook, for example, in the consumer devices and then manage our business accordingly.
Dave Zinsner: The only thing I'd add is, in the prepared remarks, leading up to it, I did say that pricing and demand trends were favorable. And that included all the way up until today, but of course, there is a higher degree of uncertainty and that's kind of why we got to the range we did.
Operator: That does end our session. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2019-12-18 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Micron Technology's First Quarter 2020 Financial Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your host, Head of Investor Relations, Farhan Ahmad. Sir, please go ahead.

We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after today's date to conform these statements to actual results. I'll now turn the call over to Sanjay.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you. Farhan. Good afternoon. Micron is off to a solid start in our fiscal 2020. Despite a challenging industry environment, we delivered good profitability, maintained positive free cash flow, and strengthened our product portfolio. Industry supply demand balance continues to improve in both DRAM and NAND. Recent trends in our business give us optimism that our fiscal second quarter will mark the bottom for our financial performance, which we expect to start improving in our fiscal third quarter, with continued recovery in the second half of calendar 2020. Our strategy to increase high-value solutions, enhance customer engagement, and improve our cost structure is producing results. We have materially improved our competitive position, structurally strengthened our profitability, and are poised to drive long term shareholder value as industry conditions improve. High-value solutions in fiscal 2019 accounted for approximately 50% of NAND bits. We expect this figure to grow to over two-thirds of our NAND bits sold for fiscal 2020, and we remain on track to drive 80% of our NAND bits into high-value solutions in fiscal 2021. This mix improvement is an important tailwind for us as it improves our profitability and reduces the volatility in our margins. At our Micron Insight event in October, we articulated a vision for Micron's transformation through greater vertical integration and differentiated products for the new data economy. I will highlight two of these and encourage you to view Sumit Sadana's Insight keynote, available on our website, for more detail. First, we announced the acquisition of a small company called FWDNXT. The FWDNXT Deep Learning Accelerator, hardware and software technology, when combined with advanced Micron memory, makes it possible to deploy neural network models from any framework into edge devices for inference. FWDNXT's unique technology is an important capability in our portfolio that will help us learn and better address customers' needs in the evolving AI ecosystem. At Insight, we also launched our first 3D XPoint product, the X100, which is the world's fastest storage device. The Micron X100 SSD is dramatically faster than any other SSD, including those built with NAND or 3D XPoint technology, and we are proud that it was showcased at Microsoft's Ignite conference by their Azure team. In October, we closed our acquisition of Intel's stake in the IMFT joint venture. We plan on relocating equipment and certain manufacturing employees to other Micron sites as we right-size the Lehi fab. Redeploying equipment will also help us optimize Micron's front-end equipment CapEx. As with any innovative technology, it will take time to scale up our 3D XPoint product portfolio, ramp revenues, and achieve healthy margins, and we are excited about the long-term potential of 3D XPoint for both memory and storage applications. As the only company in the world with a portfolio of DRAM, NAND, and 3D XPoint technologies, we are in a unique position to develop differentiated products for our customers. I will now turn to technology and manufacturing operations. In DRAM, our industry-leading 1Z LP4 DRAM-based uMCP had the fastest revenue ramp of any product in the history of our mobile business. Our production mix on 1Z will increase throughout 2020, and DRAM cost reductions will be skewed toward the second half of FY2020. Our previously announced cleanroom expansion in Taiwan is on track, and we expect output in calendar 2021. This cleanroom expansion is EUVcapable. While we continue to evaluate EUV technology for deployment in DRAM production, our current assessment shows superior economics through 1 gamma node utilizing advanced immersion technology along with Micron's proprietary multi-patterning technologies. We are encouraged by recent industry progress on EUV productivity and will be prepared to deploy EUV when it becomes cost effective to do so. In NAND, we are continuing to make progress on our replacement gate transition and expect to begin production on our 128-layer, first-generation RG node in the second half of fiscal 2020. As a reminder, this node will be deployed for a limited set of products, and we expect minimal NAND cost reduction in fiscal 2020. It will be followed by an introduction of a higher-layer-count, second-generation RG node in fiscal 2021 targeted for a broader implementation, which will begin to provide more robust cost reduction as it ramps. This second-generation RG node will leverage our NAND technology leadership in CMOS under the array, as well as QLC. Now turning to highlights by products and markets. In SSDs, demand from data center customers was strong in fiscal first quarter. Attach rates and capacities for client and consumer SSDs have continued to increase across our customers. There are supply shortages for SSDs across the industry, and pricing trends are improving. We are making strong progress on our transition to NVMe. As of fiscal second quarter, we will have NVMe SSDs for all market segments, which positions us to gain share in fiscal 2020. NVMe client SSD bit shipments represented almost three-quarters of our client SSD bits in fiscal Q1, versus virtually none a year ago. In the data center market, sales of our previously announced high-performance NVMe SSD nearly tripled quarter-over-quarter, and we announced a 96-layer mainstream data center NVMe SSD. While growing our presence in NVMe, we continue to maximize our value proposition for the SATA market by ramping 96-layer NAND products. We achieved qualifications with multiple OEMs on our 96-layer SATA data center SSD. Our QLC technology continues to gain traction. We have QLC SSDs in volume production for SATA SSDs in the data center and consumer markets, as well as NVME SSDs for the consumer market. We became the first company to ship a 96-layer, second-generation QLC SATA consumer SSD. In mobile, F1Q MCP DRAM and NAND bits grew approximately 50% quarter-over-quarter, and our MCP market share increased approximately 50% year-over-year. In fiscal Q1, our leading-edge 1Z LP4 DRAM-based uMCP achieved qualification at multiple OEMs, driving the fastest mobile product revenue ramp, I mentioned earlier. We are confident that 5G will be positive for both memory and storage content growth, as well as smartphone unit sales, and are encouraged to see the launch of affordable 5G phones with price points as low as $300 that feature a minimum of 6 gigabyte of DRAM. The 5G phones launched to date average 8 gigabyte of DRAM and 200 gigabyte of NAND, significantly higher than the average content in smartphones today. Our leadership on DRAM power efficiency continues to drive customer preference for our products, and we remain well positioned in this market. We have the lowest-power and highest-bandwidth LP5 product that begins volume production this quarter, which we expect will become more important in 2021 as 5G adoption accelerates. In data center, strong server DRAM demand in the second half of calendar 2019 is creating an industrywide shortage of high-quality, high-density modules, for which we are seeing incremental demand from our customers. New CPU architectures supporting higher-density chips and increased number of channels are driving strong DRAM content growth in servers. In fiscal Q1, we saw strong demand growth from enterprise and cloud customers. In graphics, bit shipments remained stable with GDDR6 PC graphics cards showing strong growth, offset by seasonal weakness in gaming consoles. In fiscal Q1, we began shipments of our new 14 gigabit per second GDDR6 and are well positioned to benefit from the launch of next-generation gaming consoles in calendar 2020. The launch of these new gaming consoles will drive robust multi-year demand in graphics memory, and these consoles will deploy SSDs in place of hard drives for the first time. This continues a trend of SSDs replacing hard drives across more high-volume applications. In the PC market, bit shipments in fiscal first quarter continued the growth trend from last quarter. Nevertheless, we are cautious on our near-term outlook for the PC segment due to reported CPU shortages, which seem likely to continue at least into early calendar 2020. In automotive, despite sluggish worldwide auto sales, we saw quarter-over-quarter revenue growth driven by secular memory and storage content growth. Our leadership in low-power DRAM is also driving growth for us in this market. In fiscal first quarter, we qualified and shipped the industry's first BGA NVMe SSD for automotive applications, which offers industry-leading performance and capacity in a small form factor and is well-suited to service the storage needs of increasing autonomous features. Now turning to our market outlook. Our base-case assumption on which all our projections are based, assumes that there are no perturbations to the demand environment due to macroeconomic conditions or trade-related developments. In DRAM, there has been a strong recovery in the second half of calendar 2019, and our view of calendar 2019 industry bit demand growth has increased to approximately 20%. This stronger than expected demand has resulted in pockets of shortages for us. We continue to exercise price discipline and walk away from price requests that do not meet our objectives. While these actions may impact short-term revenue, improving our business mix will enhance our long-term profitability. We are encouraged by recent DRAM pricing trends and are optimistic about improving supply demand balance throughout calendar 2020. As we discussed on our last call, a portion of the strength in demand in the second half of calendar 2019 may be attributable to inventory builds in China, and we expect some of this customer inventory to normalize sometime in calendar 2020. As a result, we expect calendar 2020 industry DRAM bit demand growth to be in the mid-teens percent range year-over-year, which is somewhat lower than our prior outlook, due to stronger demand in calendar 2019. We expect industry bit supply growth for calendar 2020 to be somewhat less than the demand as industry bit supply growth decelerates due to industry CapEx reductions. We continue to target our long-term bit supply growth CAGR to be close to the industry's long-term bit demand growth CAGR of mid-to-high teens. In calendar 2019, our bit supply growth will be less than the industry supply growth of mid-teens, and in 2020 our bit supply growth is expected to be slightly above industry bit supply growth. Turning to NAND, our industry bit demand growth expectation is in the mid-40% range in calendar 2019, and high 20s to low 30s percent range in calendar 2020. We expect calendar 2020 industry bit supply to be lower than industry bit demand as a result of industry CapEx reductions, and consequently, we expect the industry environment to improve through calendar 2020. Micron's NAND bit supply growth in calendar 2019 is likely to be slightly below industry bit demand growth and in calendar 2020 will be meaningfully below that of the industry. However, we expect our NAND bit shipment growth in calendar 2020 to be close to industry bit demand growth as we ship our inventory during the first generation of our RG transition. As we go through the transition to replacement gate, we expect our multi-year supply growth CAGR to be in line with the industry's demand CAGR of approximately 30%. Before I turn it over to Dave, I wanted to provide an update on our business with Huawei. As previously disclosed, we are continuing to ship some products to Huawei that are not subject to Export Administration Regulations and Entity List restrictions. We applied for, and recently received, all requested licenses that enable us to provide support for these products, as well as qualify new products for Huawei's mobile and server businesses. Additionally, these licenses allow us to ship previously restricted products that we manufacture in the United States, which represent a very small portion of our sales. However, there are still some products outside of the mobile and server markets that we are unable to sell to Huawei. Receiving the licenses is a positive development, and we are thankful to the U.S. administration for approving these licenses. Prior to receiving these licenses, Entity List restrictions severely limited our ability to qualify new products at Huawei. Although, we are now able to qualify new products with Huawei's mobile and server businesses, it will take some time before the qualifications are completed and contribute to revenue. Consequently, we do not expect these licenses to have a material impact on our revenue in the next couple of quarters. I'll now turn it over to Dave to provide our financial results and guidance.
David Zinsner: Thanks Sanjay. Micron's FQ1 results were largely consistent with our expectations as market conditions continued to stabilize. During the quarter, DRAM price declines decelerated from recent quarters, and we saw pricing improvements in NAND. Total company revenues grew sequentially, and our total inventory declined in absolute terms. We generated positive free cash flow during the quarter, made progress on our share repurchase program, and further strengthened our balance sheet. The results on today's call reflect our previously announced changes in NAND depreciable life to seven years from five years, and the change in reporting from our previous disclosures, which classified all MCP and SSD revenues as NAND revenue, to a view now that disaggregates these revenues into DRAM and NAND. The following DRAM and NAND growth figures use restated historical revenues for an apples-to-apples comparison. Total FQ1 revenue was approximately $5.1 billion. Revenue was up 6% sequentially and down 35% year-over-year. FQ1 DRAM revenue was $3.5 billion, representing 67% of total revenue. DRAM revenue increased 2% sequentially and declined 41% year-on-year. Bit shipments grew approximately 10% sequentially and on a year-on-year basis were up in the mid-20% range. ASP declined in the upper-single-digit percent range sequentially. DRAM revenues included $435 million of revenues from MCPs and SSDs. FQ1 NAND revenue was approximately $1.4 billion, or 28% of total revenue. Revenue was up 18% sequentially and declined 14% year-on-year. Bit shipments grew in the mid-teen percent range sequentially and in the mid-30% range year-on-year. ASPs increased in the low-single digits sequentially. Now turning to our revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the Compute and Networking Business Unit was approximately $2 billion, an increase of 4% sequentially and down 45% year-over-year. The sequential increase was driven by higher volumes and moderating ASP declines. Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $1.5 billion, up 4% sequentially and down 34% year-over-year. MCP revenues grew strongly during the quarter driven by approximately 50% sequential growth in DRAM and NAND bits. Revenue for the Storage Business Unit in FQ1 was $968 million, an increase of 14% from FQ4 and down 15% year-over-year. Sequential revenue growth was driven by SSD volume growth and ASP increases. Finally, revenue for the Embedded Business Unit was $734 million, up 4% from FQ4 and down 21% from the prior year. Sequential revenue growth was mostly driven by the automotive market due to content growth. The consolidated gross margin for FQ1 was 27.3%, slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. FQ1 gross margins included approximately a 240-basis point negative impact or approximately $125 million due to underutilization charges at the Lehi Fab. This came in slightly better than we guided to on last quarter's call, but underutilization charges are expected to ramp higher in FQ2 as production volumes decline. We still expect the underutilization charges to average $150 million per quarter in the first half of fiscal 2020. We have taken action to reduce our spending in the Lehi Fab, which should begin to reduce underutilization charges in fiscal 2021 as these actions are implemented. Ultimately, these charges will be mitigated as our own 3D XPoint products ramp into production over the coming years. Operating expenses were $811 million as we incurred higher than usual R&D expenses to qualify new products. We expect to operate at higher levels of qualification expenses for the remainder of fiscal 2020 as we continue to expand our product portfolio. As a result, we now expect operating expenses to be approximately $3.3 billion for the fiscal year. We continue to prudently control all other operating expenses and remain flexible, should business conditions warrant. FQ1 operating income was $594 million, representing 12% of revenue. Operating margin was down 38 percentage points year-over-year and down 3 percentage points from FQ4. Our FQ1 effective tax rate was 6.9%. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 5% for the remainder of the fiscal year. Non-GAAP earnings per share in FQ1 were $0.48 down from $0.56 in FQ4 and $2.97 in the year-ago quarter. Turning to cash flows and capital spending, we generated $2 billion in cash from operations in FQ1, representing 40% of revenue. During the quarter, net capital spending was approximately $1.9 billion, down from approximately $2 billion in the prior quarter. We are continuing to target FY '20 CapEx in the range of $7 billion to $8 billion. We generated adjusted free cash flow of approximately $80 million in FQ1 compared to $260 million last quarter, and approximately $2.3 billion in the year-ago quarter. In FQ1, we repurchased 1.1 million shares for $50 million. In addition, we deployed approximately $200 million of cash to settle convertible note redemptions in the quarter removing approximately 3 million shares from our fully diluted share count. We will continue to target deploying at least 50% of our annual free cash flow toward repurchases. Days of inventory was 121, down from 131 days in FQ4. Inventory ended the quarter at $4.9 billion, down slightly from $5.1 billion at the end of FQ4. Over the last two quarters, our inventory days have declined by approximately 15%. We expect inventory days to increase in fiscal Q2 due to seasonality and then begin to reduce again for the remainder of the year. We ended the quarter with total cash of $8.3 billion and total liquidity of nearly $11 billion. We deployed approximately $1.3 billion of liquidity in FQ1 to fund the closing of our acquisition of Intel's stake in the IMFT joint venture. FQ1 ending total debt was $5.7 billion, down slightly from the prior quarter. In addition to the retirement of IMFT's member debt, we used cash on hand to retire approximately $520 million in principal of high-yield debt. This was partially offset by the draw-down of our term loan facility to fund the IMFT acquisition. Our balance sheet is very strong with net cash of $2.7 billion, and we remain committed to maintaining a net cash position. Last month, S&P upgraded Micron's credit rating to investment grade, and now all three rating agencies rate Micron's credit as investment grade. Now turning to our financial outlook. As Sanjay mentioned, our outlook throughout our earnings commentary assumes that the macroeconomic environment and trade-related issues will not impact demand. Micron's fiscal second quarter is the seasonally weakest quarter for the industry. We continue to exercise pricing discipline and reduce business at customers where pricing does not meet our objectives, and this limits our business opportunity within the quarter. Additionally, in FQ2 pockets of supply tightness are limiting our bit shipments, Lehi underutilization costs are going to step up, and our cost reductions are likely to remain modest. However, we are encouraged by recent market trends and expect that FQ2 will be the bottom of our gross margins, as pricing, increasing mix of high-value solutions, and cost reductions drive better gross margins throughout the rest of fiscal and calendar 2020. We expect a gradual recovery to start in FQ3, and to continue into the seasonally stronger second half of calendar year. With that in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for fiscal Q2 is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion, gross margin to be in the range of 27% plus or minus 150 basis points, and operating expenses to be approximately $825 million, plus or minus $25 million. Interest and other income is expected to be approximately zero. Based on a share count of approximately 1.14 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $0.35, plus or minus $0.06. As we approach the trough in this cycle, at the midpoint of our guidance, fiscal Q2 revenue will be 60% higher and gross margins 9 percentage points higher than in the prior trough, which occurred in the fiscal third quarter of 2016. Micron's solid financial performance and investment-grade balance sheet demonstrate that the New Micron is indeed structurally stronger, with higher lows and better cross-cycle revenue growth and profitability. I'll now turn the call over to Sanjay for closing remarks.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Dave. Micron is entering 2020 as a fundamentally stronger company, in an industry that is structurally transformed. Supply growth is moderating due to rising capital intensity and the slowing of Moore's Law. Demand drivers are more diversified than ever before, both in end markets and in the variety of memory and storage solutions. This change in industry dynamics creates new opportunities for Micron to innovate and provide differentiated value to customers. Nascent applications promise to further accelerate this diversification. Cloud growth continues at a brisk pace, driven by new use cases, and 5G networks are just beginning to proliferate and will usher in an age of true machine-to-machine communication with billions of connected devices. And just a little further over the horizon, AI, machine learning, and autonomous technologies will expand this potential even more. These trends are transforming every aspect of human life and driving secular growth in memory and storage. Micron's enhanced product portfolio, improved cost structure, and talented team put us in an outstanding position to capitalize on the wealth of opportunities ahead and create long-term shareholder value. We will now open for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri of SMBC Nikko. Your line is open.
Srini Pajjuri: Sanjay, just a couple of questions. I guess first on the supply shortages that you talked about, could you please elaborate because on one hand, you were talking about some shortages, on the other hand, the inventories are going up as we head into the next quarter. I'm going to have a follow-up.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So as we said last time as well as in this earnings call that we have certain shortages in DRAM on the leading-edge nodes. And you we have brought down our inventory here, overall inventory down fairly fast as Dave pointed out. And we have seen strong growth in demand in DRAM on high-quality, high-density modules for servers, as well as demand trends have continued to be pretty solid. So shortages on the leading-edge nodes on DRAM and on the NAND side, we have SSD demand growing up substantially. And our 96-layer products, as we expand the portfolio are being qualified by customers. We are seeing strong demand on our 64-layer node, where we are actually seeing some shortages and of course, as we mentioned, we experienced some back-end constraints as well. We have invested in back-end capacity, assembly and test capacity expansion. And that's - we'll - assembly and test issues impacting some of our multi-die stack on the Mobile solutions as well as SSD solutions. The assembly and test constraints will be eliminated, largely by the end of fiscal second quarter. So these are some of the things that are impacting, some of the shortages, both in DRAM and on the NAND side. And again the demand trends continue to be solid. Of course in CQ1, we see seasonality. And yes, some of our inventory may go up at the end of fiscal Q2. But overall our normal inventory days is around, - as we look ahead is around 110 days, and you know that's really a function of increasing complexity coming from the technology nodes, as well as, as we shift toward high value solutions, more SSDs, more multi-chip packages, they take longer assembly and test times as well. So those are the ones that are contributing to some of the aspects of days of inventory that when we foresee in the future, we look at it as approximately 110 days. So industry environment in terms of demand continues to be solid, pockets of shortage is building all across the industry, certainly we are experiencing that. And pricing trends overall in the industry, as you look ahead at 2020, we are optimistic about the improving pricing trends in the industry as well.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Pitzer: Congratulations on the solid results. So, Sanjay, I wanted to talk a little bit about the CapEx guidance for this fiscal year. I think I understand the strategy around NAND to kind of constrained spending on the first generation of replacement gate, where cost downs are de minimis and kind of weight to Version 2.0. But I'm kind of curious as you think about the DRAM strategy, especially given that demand came in much stronger than expected, this year, 20%, and there were some of us that thought at the beginning the year, we'd be lucky to get to low double-digit growth. How do we think about DRAM CapEx from here and your ability to kind of keep up with industry bit growth? And I guess specifically my question is, how much, leeway do you have in moving more of your mix of DRAM toward the leading-edge node as a way to grow bits rather than just shrinking?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Certainly as we move our DRAM production to leading-edge nodes, for example, through 1Z, where we mentioned that we did very well with ramping 1Z DRAM node in our mobile products during the quarter. So of course those give us a bit growth. It comes with the shrink capability and technology transitions are the best way to achieve ROI as well. What's important is, that we are being extremely disciplined and prudent in terms of managing our supply of bit growth and we want to make sure that it's aligned with our bit demand growth as well as our long-term objective is to have our supply bit growth CAGR to be aligned with the industry demand growth CAGR. We mentioned that in 2019, our DRAM supply growth somewhat below the industry supply growth and in fiscal year 2020, we - in calendar year 2020, we see our supply growth to be somewhat above the industry supply growth. But all in all, our strategy is to have our supply growth CAGR to be aligned with the industry demand growth CAGR. We feel very good about, - when we look ahead at 2020, our supply, overall position, and yes, I mean we are experiencing certain shortages on leading-nodes, and we believe that some of these shortages in the industry, as well as for us will continue in calendar year 2020 timeframe. And frankly that's a good place to be at in terms of running the business, because it helps you manage the best mix of the business as well in terms of revenue and profitability.
Operator: Our next question comes from C.J. Muse of Evercore. Your line is open.
C.J. Muse: I guess a question on the DRAM demand side. You're outlining an outlook for 15 - sorry, mid-teens growth in 2020. I am curious as you think about that number, how much of that, I guess, relates to potential pulling of China demand, potential conservatism on your part? And within that, what kind of assumptions are you making around 5G handsets and continued cloud spending through 2020? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So certainly 5G will be a growth driver. We expect 5G handset smartphones to be more weighted toward the second half of the calendar year. Cloud CapEx as you have seen the reports from various major cloud providers, cloud CapEx continues to be healthy, a meaningful portion of the cloud CapEx goes into memory and storage, and that continues to drive above average industry - above average demand as a percentage, which is the average of the total DRAM industry. And 5G phones, I think it's important to note that you content continues to grow as we mentioned in our script. I mean of course, 4G phones content continues to grow, but 5G phones are driving a step-level function increase in the average content of both DRAM as well as NAND. And our estimation is that in calendar year 2020, approximately 200 million of 5G smartphones to be sold on a global basis. So overall, when we look at the demand - industry demand of mid-teens that we have projected for calendar year 2020, keep in mind that is building upon calendar year 2019, where industry demand in the second half came in quite strong and in fact we upped our estimate of industry demand growth to approximately 20% for 2019. So you are working off a large demand, larger than previously expected total bit shipments in 2019, and obviously that has an impact on the percentage that we look at for 2020. But in terms of aggregate of bit demand, that continues to be pretty solid in 2020 as well. And as we said, 2019 was a headwind in terms of demand and supply for the industry and 2020, we look at demand and supply balance as a tailwind for the industry.
Operator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
Aaron Rakers: I guess just on the capital expenditure front, obviously you guys have talked about, reiterated to CapEx, but you're also - on the Taiwan fab, you're noting that fab is capable of EUV. I know you've talked about that you don't need that through the 1 gamma node, but it kind of suggests that you are looking at EUV as potentially something that you're evaluating. Have you pulled it, all your thoughts on EUV? And how do we think about that in the context of CapEx, not necessarily this year but looking out into the subsequent years? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So at this point we're not providing guidance for any time frame beyond our fiscal year 2020 in terms of CapEx. But as we have always said, we have been evaluating EUV technology. We have carefully evaluated EUV technology in terms of determining our roadmap for DRAM. And as you noted, through - we have said that through 1 gamma node, today we are in production with now 1Z node, starting production with 1Z and of course volume production also of 1Y node. So from 1Y to 1Z, as we look ahead at the next few generations through 1 alpha, 1 beta and 1 gamma generations, we see that of multi-patterning techniques along with immersion technology will serve us well in terms of achieving our cost objectives and having a highly cost competitive roadmap for us. So we have also said that we continue to evaluate EUV, and then we see it appropriate for deployment in our DRAM production. In terms of cost and efficiency of production, we will certainly be deploying it at a future time in that, but at this point, we see our technology roadmap through 1 gamma node to be in strong position, while we remain encouraged seeing the improvement in EUV productivity tool as well. But regarding CapEx for future years, we'll obviously always manage it as a function of our supply growth expectations as well as a function of technology and cost competitiveness and keeping our supply growth, as I said previously, aligned with demand CAGR, that's how we will manage it. And we'll share those details with you at appropriate time in the future.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Mark Delaney: So to better understand the company's commentary on its own inventory, which - nice to see that come down in dollars and days in the just completed quarter. You - as you think about your inventory, as you move through the year, I understood some of the aggregate commentary, but can you, a bit more specific, because I think, the company has been carrying extra inventory of some of these older DRAM nodes, when do you think that gets used up? And when you talk about 110 days, Sanjay, is that being a more normal level of inventory? Just given because the company is going to be carrying the extra NAND inventory for the replacement gate node. Should we be thinking about inventory running above 110 to allow for that this year, or is the 110, really a this year comment as you carry some of that extra replacement gate inventory, and is longer term it's something lower than that? Thanks.
David Zinsner: Yes, that's a good question. So, I'll try and take a crack at that first. So yeah, the comment around 110 days is kind of an optimal level of inventory when we have worked off all of the excess inventory associated with the replacement gate transition and as inventories normalize. Obviously, in the 121 days of inventory that we have today, DRAM is a bit below that, really what pulls it up to a 121 is that, NAND is quite a bit higher than that by virtue of the fact that we are executing on this strategy to hold a lot of inventory as we go into our replacement gate transition to augment what will be a robust bit growth from that first node. As Sanjay mentioned, we do expect days of inventory to go up a bit based on mix and so forth in the second quarter, because of seasonality. But we would expect it then to start trending down over the next few quarters, partly as we start to utilize this success - of NAND inventory for the replacement gate transition and also as we start to digest and administer this - the mix challenges that have created a little bit of excess spill on the DRAM front. So, we should be in pretty healthy place on DRAM within a couple of quarters.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Ambrish Srivastava: Good to see you power through this downturn with positive free cash flow. I just wanted to get back to the comment that Sanjay, you're making about the fiscal second quarter marking the bottom for fundamentals. And CapEx seems to be a little bit front-end loaded, so is free cash flow going to be positive in the fiscal second quarter as well?
David Zinsner: So I'll take a crack at that one too. I would say, maybe to start with, that the first priority of the company is to make the appropriate level investments, both in terms of R&D and which is why we have had a little bit of an increase in operating expenses, because we do want to put the right level of investment in new products, particularly high value solution products that will ultimately be the big factor in terms of our performance over the coming years. And in addition, we obviously want to make the appropriate level in terms of CapEx investments to make sure that we are, as Sanjay mentioned, investing the right level to manage supply growth and to make these node transitions. Secondarily, of course, our goal is to generate good free cash flow and ideally it was - it would be to generate pretty consistent free cash flow over multiple - or over every quarter. I would say in the second quarter what we feel really confident about is that, cash flow from operations is going to be very strong. And we will again make appropriate level of CapEx investment that could drive the free cash flow to be slightly negative or roughly around zero or potentially even a little bit more positive, but we're going to make the capital investment be what's appropriate and let free cash flow go where it goes. I would say, though, just to put this in perspective, the trough quarter of 2016, in terms of free cash flow was negative $1.3 billion, I believe. And so, if you compare that to whatever we end up doing for the second quarter, this will be massively better in terms of cash flow generation and of course that's an indication of, or an example of how we have structurally improved the business from a cost competitive perspective and from a cash flow perspective. And indeed, if this does turn out to be the bottom, as Sanjay indicated is our expectation barring any sort of macro event or trade event, we would expect free cash flow to track more positively through the remainder of the fiscal year and into the - and into the next fiscal year. So this year will be actually a pretty good year in terms of free cash flow. That'll be four consecutive years of positive, significantly positive free cash flow for the company, which of course has never been done in Micron's history. So again, ideally, we'd like to have, every quarter to be positive, that may or may not happen this quarter, but clearly, we're on the right track in terms of generating positive free cash flow for the company.
Operator: Our next question comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Harlan Sur: We've seen a strong reacceleration in cloud and hyperscale spending, also seeing some near-term strong server builds by the Asia OEMs. And it appears that the excess DRAM channel inventories in this segment have been worked on, but wanted to get your views here. And typically the cloud spending up cycle duration is about three to four quarters. So, even in a seasonally weaker period for PCs and smartphones in the first part of next year, do you see the server and data center demand remaining fairly strong?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Yes. As we look ahead, we do see server and data center demand particularly within cloud to be strong. We have had, as we mentioned in our FQ1, strong growth from cloud and we certainly see that happening through 2020 as well as. As we mentioned, high-densities are actually in shortage in the industry. And it really is about all the trend of more AI workloads, more need for memory and storage as CPUs get introduced that can work with higher density memory as well as have more channels, which is increasing the attach rate of DRAM content for server and increasing it. So these are all the trend that actually point to continuing higher than industry average level of growth for DRAMs in the cloud and server. And same thing on the NAND, on the SSD front, average density as well as the average usage of flash in clouds and data center applications continues to increase. And we have always said, that this is the long-term demand driver for memory and storage industry. And memory and storage is critical in terms of driving greater value in these cloud applications and in these enterprise applications, and hence you are seeing continuing strong growth in these end-market segments. And I'd just like to point out, that even in 2019, while the demand to the suppliers was weaker in the first half of the year, because the customers, particularly in this space were using up the inventory that they had to meet end consumption, but it's important to understand that the end consumption of DRAM and NAND even in challenging 2019 periods continued to be healthy. And as we look ahead, this will be a strong driver of growth in the industry, but I just want to point out that, as we previously discussed, smartphones, content growth there, automotive applications, continuing to drive greater content, graphics, gaming consoles, new gaming consoles are also driving HDD replacement with SSDs as well as greater DRAM content in those applications. So, I think the demand drivers and our pieces that has always been there, that the industry has strong demand drivers has very much been intact. And we look forward to good environment for our industry in 2020.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Wong of Instinet. Your line is open.
David Wong: Could you tell us what proportion of DRAM bits are currently on 1Z technology? And what do you expect will be on 1Z technology by the end of calendar 2020? And what's the differences between cost per bit on 1Z compared to 1Y?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So we don't provide cost details with respect to 1Z versus 1Y or from one node to the other node. But as we have said before, that we expect our 1Y plus 1Z combined bit production to cross over our total bit production by summer of 2020. That means, bit crossover with 1Y and 1Z combined by summer of 2020. And as we mentioned, we are doing well with our 1Z, and in fact in mobile products, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we saw the fastest ramp of 1Z node in the history of our mobile presence.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.
Joe Moore: I wanted to ask a bit more about the China inventory build that you talked about. Can you kind of talk about the reasons, is it concern about ability to procure? Is it tariff related? What's the reason for the pull-in? And anyway you can help us kind of understand the magnitude would be helpful. Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: As we have mentioned before, we saw some China buying pattern that was above normal compared to the past that we have seen. And we attribute that to some of the U.S./China trade tensions, and perhaps some of the customers in China procuring and shifting to, perhaps a longer-term strategy of carrying more inventory, because in terms of the U.S./China trade aspects, while Phase 1 deal is definitely encouraging to see, that is happening. But there is still ongoing for longer-term lack of clarity. So perhaps, some of the China customers have shifted their strategy toward carrying higher levels of inventory. I would say that, that perhaps is an important reason. There is of course Chinese New Year as well, that can play a role in the China demand, Chinese New Year is earlier this year compared to the typical years, but there is no question that, most important thing is that the underlying demand drivers are strong. And when you look at smartphone content growth, that's happening in all smartphones across the globe, including the ones sold by the China manufacturers, the contents both on DRAM and NAND side continues to increase, and certainly as we have talked about, 5G is - a significant driver and certainly 5G phones are planned to be sold, perhaps in largest quantities in China first. So all of these underlying demand trends, I think are the most important thing here as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Your question, please.
Blayne Curtis: Maybe Sanjay, just a follow on Joe's question, I'm just kind of curious, you said it'll take couple of quarters for Huawei to get back to the numbers. Are you embedding anything in the calendar '20 outlook you have? And I'm just kind of curious, following on that point, in terms of you're expecting some moderation from China, have you seen any signs of that yet?
Sanjay Mehrotra: I'm sorry, I didn't quite get the last part of the question, expecting...
Blayne Curtis: Following on Joe's question, you're expecting some moderation after an inventory build, have you seen it yet? Or is that just something you expect will happen at some point?
Sanjay Mehrotra: What we said is that in terms of our estimation of the industry demand growth in calendar year 2020, we have baked in that some of the inventory that we may have seen in China customers build, we have baked in that some of that will be consumed and inventory levels will be lower than what we may be thinking at this point with those customers over the course of calendar year 2020. And with respect to your first piece of the question on Huawei, we mentioned that, now that we have received the licenses, we are able to work with them on new product qualifications. And as you know well, new product qualifications do take you know a few months, couple of quarters before they get qualified into new platforms and then we can potentially look at additional opportunities, but at this point, I mean, our focus is to resume that product qualification work both for server, as well as mobile applications.
Operator: Our next question comes from Raji Gill of Needham & Company. Please go ahead.
Raji Gill: Yes, thanks and congrats as well as you added to this cycle. A question on mix shift for NAND, specifically, Sanjay, you had mentioned that next year, you will be ramping at a higher rate NVMe SSDs, as well as UFS controllers in the China handset market. Could you talk a little bit about the trajectory of those products and how that positive mix shift in NAND will potentially affect overall margins? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: I'll have Dave comment on the margin piece of it. But you know, certainly as we expand our portfolio of NVMe solutions for from clients to data center and of course certainly on the consumer side as well, we have done well as we reported for FQ1 in terms of expanding the portfolio and capitalizing on increased sales of SSDs. And we certainly look at gaining share throughout calendar 2020 as we expand our portfolio there. I think what's important to note is that our share there is today under-represented. So as we shift toward these higher value solutions with expanded portfolio, I mean we are basically trying to bring our share in line with what it should be given our share of the total NAND bits. And this is the part of the strategy that we talked about in terms of shifting the mix of our high value solutions, which now are at about 50% in terms of bits toward higher number in the future. And of course, part of that, ongoing shift is toward multi-chip packages as well as discrete managed NAND solutions for mobile applications, there we pointed out that on a year-over-year basis, we have increased our share by 50%. Yet we remain underrepresented and therein lies further opportunity for us to be increasing our share in these markets. So, high value solutions is a very important part of our strategy. It enables us to gain greater stability, greater margin opportunity through the cycles, as well as brings us closer to understanding the application landscape with the customer. And I'm very pleased that Micron is executing quite well with respect to achieving our objective in this area.
David Zinsner: So obviously, high value solutions, the reason one - one of the major reasons for shifting the strategy to high value solutions is because they carry higher margins. I'll just give you a data point, if you look back at fiscal '19 and look at these high value solutions relative to consumer components, you'll find the margins were about 30 points - 30 percentage points higher. So significantly higher - opportunity to get higher margins and, of course, that obviously helps the overall margins of the company.
Operator: Last question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is open.
Hans Mosesmann: Congratulations to the team for the execution. Sanjay, on the server and data center module dynamic where you're seeing a higher mix of quality or higher density, what was the density on average a year ago, just to get a reference and how that has improved? And what exactly is driving this move? Is it a new processor architecture? Or is it market share gains? That would be helpful. Thanks.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Yes, in cloud servers as well as enterprise server, the average density is around 300 gigabyte per server average consumption of DRAM. And this trend is expected when you look at the CAGR over the next few years, expected to continue to grow in double digit range anywhere when you look at '19 to '22 kind of CAGR, around 20% CAGR for average content growth in servers, in cloud and enterprise applications. So this is definitely a high growth area for the market. And when you look at the new CPUs, like Cascade Lake and other new CPUs starting in 2019, as I mentioned earlier they support the usage of higher density chips, that means the support usage of 16 gigabyte chips, as well as more channels in the new CPUs and that is definitely driving greater ability to use more content per server for DRAM. And of course, at the end of the day, it's about the workloads that applications are running, and those workloads are requiring - increasing requirement for speed and that's translating into increasing requirement for memory as more and more real-time data analytics kind of applications and AI applications are being - applications are being done in enterprise and data center and cloud applications.
Hans Mosesmann: And as a quick follow-up. Can you give us a commentary regarding 3D XPoint used in main memory, if there is a roadmap for that this year - this coming year?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So 3D XPoint, certainly as we said, exciting opportunity for us longer term. It definitely gives us differentiated opportunity with - as the only company in the world having NAND, DRAM and 3D XPoint. We have just introduced our first storage product with 3D XPoint, the world's fastest SSD. And as you noted, I mean 3D XPoint certainly has opportunities on the memory side of the business as well. And as we look at engaging with the ecosystem, as we look at developing our products, these are the kind of opportunities both on the memory semantic applications as well as storage side of the applications, we'll be addressing over the course of next few years as we expand our product portfolio in this area. But certainly, 3D XPoint, - again these kind of things, breakthrough technologies take multiple years and require lot of ecosystem work to get the full use of the technology. And we are well on our way as we discussed at Micron Insight, and let me put a plug here again, that if you have not watched it, please do watch Sumit's presentation, I think it gives you a pretty good perspective on the capabilities of 3D XPoint technology and our vision of the future with it.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2019-09-26 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Sherry, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Micron’s Fourth Quarter 2019 Financial Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.

Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Farhan. Good afternoon. Fiscal 2019 was another solid year of execution as we continue to transform the new Micron. Despite the challenging industry environment, we achieved the second-best year in our history for revenue, free cash flow and earnings, which underscores the strength of the new Micron. We improved structural profitability by further reducing the technology gap with competitors and by strengthening our product portfolio. We also made progress on our $10 billion share repurchase program by returning $2.7 billion to our shareholders. In the fiscal fourth quarter, the Micron team’s strong execution resulted in financial performance exceeding our guidance ranges. Market trends were broadly consistent with our expectations discussed on the last earnings call. DRAM demand bounced back as the factors that impacted calendar first half demand largely dissipated. NAND elasticity is driving robust demand growth, causing industry inventories to improve rapidly. While the demand recovery in DRAM and NAND is encouraging, we remain mindful of ongoing macroeconomic and trade uncertainties. I will provide more color on our view of the market after a review of progress on our key strategic objectives. Since 2016, the actions we have taken to reduce our cost structure, increase our mix of high-value solutions, and enhance our customer engagement and go-to-market strategy have significantly improved our profitability relative to our peers. In fiscal 2019, our DRAM cost per bit declines led the industry and exceeded our internal plans, despite the headwinds from our announced reduction in wafer starts. In the fiscal fourth quarter, we began mass production and volume shipments of the industry’s first 1Z products, giving Micron feature size leadership for DRAM. We are also making good progress migrating more of our production to leading-edge nodes. While we entered fiscal 2019 with more than half of our bit production on 20 nanometer or older nodes, we ended the fiscal year with approximately three-quarters on 1X and beyond, with a meaningful portion on 1Y. As previously announced, we are expanding cleanroom space in our Taichung, Taiwan, site to support future node transitions of our existing wafer capacity, and we expect output from this facility in calendar 2021. In NAND, we continued to outpace industry cost declines during fiscal 2019. 96-layer 3D NAND is continuing to increase as a portion of our mix. Meanwhile, we achieved our first yielding dies using replacement gate or RG for short. This milestone further reduces the risk for our RG transition. As a reminder, our first RG node will be 128 layers and will be used for a select set of products. We don’t expect RG to deliver meaningful cost reductions until fiscal 2021 when our second-generation RG node is broadly deployed. Consequently, we are expecting minimal cost reductions in NAND in fiscal 2020. Our RG production deployment approach will optimize the ROI of our NAND capital investments. In addition, we announced the grand opening of our Singapore cleanroom expansion in August, which will enable the transition of our existing NAND wafer capacity to future generations of 3D NAND technology. We are continuing to make solid progress with our 3D XPoint product development and remain on track to launch our initial products in calendar 2019. Now turning to highlights by markets. In SSDs, the industry transition from SATA to NVMe in fiscal 2019 continued at a rapid rate. While we have been late to the NVMe market, our progress positions us to gain share starting in fiscal 2020. For OEMs, building on strong growth last quarter, we more than tripled revenue shipments of our NVMe client SSD sequentially with sales penetration in multiple Tier 1 PC OEMs. Our QLC-based NVMe consumer SSD was a best-selling SSD on Amazon Prime Day in North America. Our consumer SSD segment achieved record revenue and unit shipments with bits posting triple-digit percentage growth year-over-year, driven by our strategy to pursue channel expansion that extends our geographical and customer reach. Price elasticity is driving an increase in attach rates and capacities, leading to solid demand growth across client and consumer SSDs. We are also making solid progress on advancing our roadmap of NVMe SSDs for the enterprise and cloud markets. In fiscal 2019, we introduced the high-performance 9300 line of NVMe products, targeting high-end data center applications, and are looking forward to increasing adoption of this product. In mobile, our portfolio featuring the industry’s lowest-power and highest-density products is enabling our customers to bring differentiated capabilities to the market and helping us deliver outstanding financial performance in a challenging industry environment. In fiscal 2019, we delivered mobile revenue that was down only 3% from 2018’s record performance, despite a significant drop in market pricing and the impact from the addition of Huawei to the Entity List. Our mobile margins were resilient, and our managed NAND bit shipments in fiscal 2019 more than tripled year-on-year, driven by growth of MCP and discrete NAND eMMC and UFS products. In the fiscal fourth quarter, we started volume shipments of a new leading-edge UFS-based MCP that uses our 1Z LPDRAM. This new UFS MCP will bring flagship-like performance and densities to mid and high-end smartphones. We are also leading the industry in power-efficient, high-bandwidth LP5 DRAM, which positions us well as 5G begins to accelerate in 2020. In data center, customer inventories for DRAM have reduced significantly, driving solid sequential demand growth for server solutions in both cloud and enterprise markets. New processor platforms are also creating an uptick in demand for higher-density and higher-performance DRAM modules. In graphics, we saw strong sequential bit growth, with increases for graphics cards and gaming consoles, as normal buying resumed following inventory reductions in DRAM. In the PC market, DRAM module and SSD shipments continued the growth trend from last quarter, as CPU shortages further subsided. In automotive, we continued to increase revenue year-over-year, despite weak auto industry unit sales and a challenging DRAM industry environment. Our growth was supported by secular content increases, our superior quality, and well-established customer relationships. LP4 shipments in the fiscal fourth quarter were over 5x higher year-over-year, as lower-power DRAM becomes increasingly important for new Infotainment and ADAS systems. We continue to have leading industry share in automotive. Before talking about the market outlook, I want to provide an update on our business with Huawei and the ongoing impact of trade uncertainties. As we noted last quarter, we started shipping some products to Huawei that are not subject to Export Administration Regulations and Entity List restrictions. In the fiscal fourth quarter, sales to Huawei declined sequentially and were down meaningfully from the levels we anticipated prior to the addition of Huawei to the Entity List. We have applied for licenses with the Department of Commerce that would allow us to ship additional products, but there have been no decisions on licenses to date. We see ongoing uncertainty surrounding U.S. China trade negotiations. If the Entity List restrictions against Huawei continue and we are unable to get licenses, we could see a worsening decline in our sales to Huawei over the coming quarters. Now, turning to our market outlook, which assumes that the macroeconomic environment doesn’t materially deteriorate from current levels. I’ll begin with our industry outlook, and then turn to Micron’s outlook for DRAM and NAND. The DRAM and NAND industry demand growth in the second half of calendar 2019, compared to the first half, is primarily being driven by a normalization of inventories at most customers, and secular growth trends in various end markets. In recent months, we have seen increased demand from customers headquartered in mainland China, some of whom could be making strategic decisions to build higher levels of inventory in the face of increased trade tensions between the U.S. and China, as well as Japan and Korea. Our view of calendar 2019 DRAM industry bit demand growth remains unchanged at mid-teens, with supply exceeding demand due to previously discussed factors that impacted first half calendar 2019 demand. Based on our early view of calendar 2020, we expect the industry to see bit demand growth of high-teens to 20%, above supply growth of only mid-teens, which should help normalize supplier inventories and enable a healthy industry environment. We expect the long-term DRAM bit demand growth CAGR to be mid to high-teens. Turning to NAND industry outlook, demand elasticity and industry supply reductions are resulting in improving market conditions and declining industry inventory. On the supply side, CapEx and wafer start cuts across the industry are leading to supply reductions. A power outage at a competitor’s fab also reduced industry supply and inventory. We now expect calendar 2019 industry bit demand growth in the low to mid-40% range, which will exceed industry bit supply growth of approximately 30%. Based on our view of calendar 2020, we estimate industry bit demand growth of high 20s to low-30% range, with supply growing somewhat below demand. We believe that NAND industry margins, which are at the lowest levels in the last 10 years, should start increasing for the rest of the year. We expect the long-term NAND bit demand growth CAGR to be in the low-30% range. Specific to Micron’s DRAM outlook, we are seeing solid demand from customers across multiple segments. This is improving our inventory, and we have started to see pockets of tight supply, particularly in leading-edge nodes. However, we still have elevated inventory levels on older nodes. As a result, we are continuing with the previously disclosed DRAM wafer start reductions of 5%. We expect Micron’s calendar 2019 bit supply growth to be slightly below industry demand growth of mid-teens, and expect our calendar 2020 DRAM bit supply growth to be close to the market demand growth. We also expect our DRAM cost reductions to moderate in fiscal 2020 to high-single digits. As we have said before, the increasing complexity of more advanced DRAM nodes is resulting in a slower pace of cost declines for the industry. As our DRAM inventory improves, we are committed to maintaining price discipline. While we are having to respond to some aggressive market pricing, we have started walking away from some transactions, as we look to optimize our profitability. Turning to Micron’s NAND outlook, we expect our calendar 2019 bit growth to be slightly above industry supply growth, and in calendar 2020, we expect Micron’s bit supply growth to be significantly below the industry demand growth as we transition a limited portion of our wafer starts to our first-generation replacement gate node and use inventory to support customer demand. Supply growth will also be impacted by our previously announced wafer start reductions of approximately 10%. We are seeing some capacity tightness in our back-end manufacturing operations due to significant increases in demand for high-capacity NAND products. This is another data point of elasticity kicking in on high-value NAND solutions. While NAND and DRAM market conditions are showing some promising signs, in order to bring our supply in line with the market demand, we are targeting our fiscal 2020 front-end equipment CapEx to be reduced by more than 30% from fiscal 2019. Our CapEx decision is also influenced by macroeconomic uncertainty and low industry profitability. Our front-end CapEx outlook reflects our strategy for limited ramp of our first RG node. While we are reducing front-end equipment CapEx, we are spending significantly more on shell space to enable future node transition, and also investing in a new SSD packaging facility in Penang, Malaysia. As always, we will maintain flexibility and discipline while investing appropriately for Micron’s long-term success. I want to emphasize that our goal is to manage our DRAM and NAND bit supply growth CAGR in line with industry demand. As we catch up on the technology and cost gaps to best-in-class competitors in DRAM and transition to RG technology in NAND, our supply growth may fluctuate, but we expect the medium-to-long-term growth rate of our supply to approximately equal the rate of demand growth across both NAND and DRAM markets. We are also focused on maximizing the ROI of our CapEx investments. And for this reason, we are not emphasizing wafer capacity growth, but instead focusing on bit growth driven by technology transitions. In addition, some of our CapEx is dedicated to increasing our internal capacity for assembly, packaging and test, which help us drive cost reductions without adding any bit growth and has good ROI. I’ll now turn it over to Dave to provide our financial results and guidance.
David Zinsner: Thanks Sanjay. As Sanjay mentioned, Micron delivered resilient performance throughout a challenging year for the industry, highlighted by fiscal Q4 results that exceeded our guided ranges for revenue and earnings. As market conditions evolved during the year, we curtailed our planned operating expenses and capital expenditures, allowing us to preserve margins and generate healthy free cash flow. We achieved our first corporate investment grade rating, strengthened our balance sheet, and meaningfully reduced our share count. All-in-all, fiscal 2019 was a year of stellar progress that sets Micron up for attractive growth as industry conditions recover. Turning to our recent financial results. Total fiscal Q4 revenue was approximately $4.9 billion. Revenue was up 2% sequentially and down 42% year-over-year. Revenue exceeded our guidance range largely due to better-than-expected demand. Full fiscal 2019 revenue totaled $23.4 billion, down 23% year-over-year. Fiscal Q4 DRAM revenue was $3.1 billion, representing 63% of total revenue. DRAM revenue increased 1% sequentially and declined 48% year-on-year. Bit shipments grew approximately 30% sequentially and in the mid-teens percent range year-on-year, as customer inventories improved significantly. ASP declined approximately 20% sequentially. For full fiscal 2019, DRAM revenue was $15.2 billion, down 28% from fiscal 2018 as bits grew in the low single-digit percent range and ASP declined approximately 30%. Fiscal Q4 NAND revenue was approximately $1.5 billion, or 31% of total revenue. Revenue was up 5% sequentially, but declined 32% year-on-year. Bit shipments grew in the low-to-mid-teens percent range sequentially. ASP declined in the upper single-digit percent range. We are starting to see supply tightness in portions of the NAND market, and prices are beginning to increase. Full fiscal 2019 NAND revenue was $6.9 billion, down 12% from fiscal 2018, as ASP declines of mid-40% range more than offset strong bit shipment growth. Now turning to our revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the Compute and Networking Business Unit was $1.9 billion in fiscal Q4, a decline of 8% sequentially and down 56% year-over-year. ASP declines across most segments continued to be the leading cause of lower revenue. For the fiscal year, revenue was $10 billion, down 35% year-over-year. Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit in fiscal Q4 was $1.4 billion, up 20% sequentially and down 26% year-over-year. Both DRAM and NAND bits had strong growth driven by seasonality and continued content growth in smartphones. Our mobile business gained share in the year, driven by a stronger product portfolio. For the full fiscal year, MBU revenue was $6.4 billion, down only 3% from fiscal 2018. Revenue for the Storage Business Unit in fiscal Q4 was $848 million, an increase of 4% from fiscal Q3 and down 32% year-over-year. For the fiscal year, SBU revenue was $3.8 billion, down 24% from fiscal 2018. And finally, revenue for the Embedded Business Unit was $705 million in fiscal Q4, up 1% from fiscal Q3 and down 24% from the prior year. For the fiscal year, EBU revenue was $3.1 billion, down 10% from fiscal 2018. The consolidated gross margin for fiscal Q4 was 30.6%, above our guidance range due to our strong execution, improving demand and slightly better pricing. Q4 gross margins included approximately 200 basis point negative impact or approximately $100 million due to the underutilization charges at IMFT. Starting in fiscal Q1 and continuing for the foreseeable future, we expect to incur an underutilization impact of approximately $150 million per quarter, with about half of the impact consisting of non-cash items. Over time, as our 3D XPoint business ramps, this underutilization impact will be mitigated, but as you can expect, it takes time to commercialize a new breakthrough technology. Meanwhile, we will continue to look for ways to optimize our costs and will provide updates on material progress over time. With respect to U.S. tariffs on imports from China, with continued mitigation, we were able to contain their impact on our consolidated gross margin in fiscal Q4 to less than 20 basis points. Operating expenses were $797 million, and included some one-time expenses. We continue to control our expenses tightly, and our SG&A as a percent of revenue is meaningfully lower than our competitors. Fiscal Q4 operating income was $694 million, representing 14% of revenue. Operating margin was down 38 percentage points year-over-year and down 9 percentage points from fiscal Q3. Our full fiscal 2019 operating income was $7.8 billion or 33% of our fiscal year revenue. Our fiscal Q4 effective tax rate was 8.8%. For the fiscal year, our effective tax rate was approximately 7.3%, which included the tax benefit we recorded in fiscal Q3. Going forward, we expect our tax rate to be mid-to-high single digits. Non-GAAP earnings per share in fiscal Q4 were $0.56, down from $1.05 in fiscal Q3 and $3.53 in the year-ago quarter. For full fiscal 2019, our non-GAAP earnings per share was $6.35, down from $11.95 in fiscal 2018. Turning to cash flows and capital spending, we generated $2.2 billion in cash from operations in fiscal Q4, representing 46% of revenue. For full fiscal 2019, cash from operations was $13.2 billion, representing 56% of revenue, down from $17.4 billion or 57% of revenue in fiscal 2018. Cash flow margins remained almost flat due to effective working capital management. During the quarter, net capital spending, was approximately $2 billion, down from $2.2 billion in the prior quarter. For full fiscal 2019, our net CapEx was $9.1 billion, up from $8.2 billion in fiscal 2018, but down meaningfully from the $10 billion to $11 billion plan we originally had entering fiscal 2019. We expect our fiscal 2020 net CapEx to be in the range of $7 billion to $8 billion, down meaningfully from fiscal 2019. We expect that CapEx for buildings and back-end manufacturing will increase significantly from last year, while the front-end equipment CapEx will decline more than 30% year-on-year. Looking at cash generation, we generated adjusted free cash flow of approximately $260 million in fiscal Q4 compared to $500 million in fiscal Q3 and $3.1 billion in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted free cash flow for fiscal 2019 was $4.1 billion, down from $9.2 billion in fiscal 2018. We received notice for approximately $180 million of convertible note redemptions in the quarter, which will remove approximately 4 million shares from our ongoing share count in fiscal Q1. For full fiscal 2019, we returned approximately $2.7 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks, representing 65% of free cash flow, at an average purchase price of $40. Including these share repurchases and our convertible note redemptions, we reduced our average diluted share count by 80 million shares in fiscal 2019, representing 7% of shares outstanding. We remain committed to returning at least 50% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders in the form of share repurchases in the future. Days of inventory was 131, down from 143 days in fiscal Q3. Inventory ended the quarter at $5.1 billion, increasing from $4.9 billion at the end of fiscal Q3. We will continue to focus on reducing our days of inventory and expect to see further reduction in fiscal Q1. As mentioned before, we are seeing pockets of tight supply in certain parts of our business. Our long-term normalized inventory target has increased over time to above 100 days as a result of greater process complexity and the broadening of our product portfolio to high-value solutions, such as SSDs that require longer assembly and test cycle time. Total cash ended the quarter at $9.2 billion, up quarter-over-quarter, largely as a result of our $1.75 billion investment grade debt issuance. Our total debt increased to $5.9 billion. Total liquidity ended fiscal Q4 at $13 billion. We are holding approximately $1.4 billion of liquidity for the acquisition of the IMFT joint venture, expected in fiscal Q1 2020. This acquisition will eliminate approximately $700 million of member debt financing and will be funded by drawing down $1.25 billion from our term loan facility secured in fiscal Q4. Before moving on to guidance, I want to share some expected changes to our upcoming reporting. We continue to evaluate planned technology node transitions, capital spending, and re-use rates for NAND equipment. Based on our preliminary assessment, we anticipate changing the depreciable life of our NAND equipment from five to seven years beginning in fiscal Q1 2020. This change will reduce our depreciation expense included in cost of goods sold for Q1 by approximately $80 million, and increasing to approximately $100 million to $150 million per quarter for the remainder of fiscal 2020. As a reminder, depreciable life for DRAM equipment is already seven years. Also starting in Q1, we expect to change how we report MCP revenue, which we currently include within NAND revenue. We will begin disaggregating MCP revenue into DRAM and NAND, which will reduce our reported NAND revenue and margins in FQ1 while increasing our DRAM revenue. We believe that this change will help improve the transparency of our DRAM and NAND businesses. Now turning to our financial outlook. As our portfolio strengthens and we improve our share in high-value segments, we are seeing growing demand for both DRAM and NAND and this is creating pockets of supply shortage, particularly in some leading-edge nodes and in back-end manufacturing. However, the market remains competitive and industry inventories continue to adjust to economic and geopolitical uncertainties. Notwithstanding these challenges, we expect bit shipments for both DRAM and NAND to grow in fiscal Q1, with NAND increasing more than DRAM. With that in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for fiscal Q1 is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $5 billion, plus or minus $200 million, gross margin to be in the range of 26.5%, plus or minus 150 basis points, and operating expenses to be approximately $780 million, plus or minus $25 million. Based on a share count of approximately 1.13 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $0.46, plus or minus $0.07. Despite a variety of industry and trade-related challenges in fiscal 2019, Micron delivered strong financial results. At our 2018 Analyst Day, we laid out how we believed Micron was structurally improved and able to weather the storm in even challenging periods for the industry. While we are not out of the woods, we are proud of our execution as we have moved through the current cycle. We are exiting the fiscal year with a stronger product portfolio, deeper customer relationships, and our highest liquidity and net cash position to date, and we have also made good progress on our share buyback program. We are well-positioned to emerge from the current cycle ready to capitalize on the secular growth trends driving our business. I will now turn the call over to Sanjay for concluding remarks.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Dave. Fiscal 2019 has been a solid year of accomplishments for the New Micron, as we continue to focus on structural improvements across a range of functions in the Company, to take our performance to new heights. While we have made dramatic progress over the last couple of years, there is significant opportunity ahead of us to further improve our operations, drive product cost reductions, further improve engineering execution, build on our go-to-market strategy and initiatives, deepen customer engagements, and enhance the core competitiveness of the Company to best-in-class levels. As we look ahead, the long-term opportunities are exciting, and we are extremely enthusiastic about the momentum we have established at the New Micron. On October 24th, we’ll be hosting our Second Annual Micron Insight event, which will bring together leaders from across the industry to discuss how a world activated by data can transform the way we use information to enrich life and how memory and storage are vital to these efforts. We will be webcasting Micron Insight live from San Francisco, and I encourage you all to tune in. We will now open for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the questions. So I'm going to talk a little bit about your customers' inventory levels. And one of the big concerns or debates in the financial community at the moment is whether the pickup in memory volumes that I think Micron seeing, is that mostly being driven by fundamentals? Or is it just potential inventory stocking because of some of the trade concerns? And Sanjay, I think you maybe talked about a bit of both factors in your prepared comments and some potential inventory stock, but also inventory coming down in some important markets like data center. So maybe you can just kind of level set and put those things together and do you think the pickup in your business is it primarily been driven by fundamentals or how much of this is maybe some of that inventory stocking because of trade concerns? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: I think certainly the pickup in business is being driven by the industry fundamentals. I would just like to remind you that in the first half of calendar 2019 because of the inventory that the customers had built up the demand to the producers was low, yet the end market demand for all applications continue to be robust. And now as the customers have worked down their inventory to normal levels, the demand is coming back to the producers and as a result, you saw in our calendar – I mean fiscal Q4 results a strong growth in DRAM bit as well as NAND. And second half is the demand is back – the customer demand is back. And yes, there maybe some level of inventory build in China, due to the reasons that I mentioned by certain customers. But I'll tell you that we do not think that that inventory build is anywhere close to the kind of inventory build that had gone on in the second half of last year, so no where materially close to that level. So overall, the industry environment in terms of demand return is certainly solid. Certainly in DRAM, there is still some excess supply with the producers. But the inventory is improving fast; we talked about our inventory actually improving faster than would we perhaps anticipated some time ago and overall we even see some shortages in some leading-edge products particularly on the DRAM side. So overall we think that industry, inventory at the producers is being consumed at a rapid clip. The demand trends are back to normal levels. And especially when you look at the trends of through next year 5G, you look at smartphone average capacity is continuing to increase both for NAND and DRAM, and cloud demand drivers continuing to be solid, new platforms, new CP architectures being used that allow greater use and higher use of DRAM capacities as well as AI applications driving more DRAM and NAND. So the demand trends, when I look at 2020 I believe that the industry demand/supply environment will be in a lot healthier place. Yes, maybe calendar Q1 may have some cyclicality, but the industry fundamentals overall from demand/supply point of view, I think in 2020 will be in a much healthier place.
David Zinsner: Another way to look at this and kind of back it up mathematically is if you look at the year-over-year bit growth in the fourth quarter it's only in the kind of 14% kind of range. So that kind of backs up the idea that this is really about industry fundamentals, more so than it is about stocking inventory.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer: Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the solid results given the macro uncertainty. I guess I have several questions, just around the guidance gross margins for the fiscal first quarter. If you look at the incremental, you think you're getting from IMFT that's more than offset by kind of the change in depreciation and yet you still kind of getting sort of a 400 basis point drop sequentially in gross margin on kind of flattish to up revenue. And I know you guys don't comment about future pricing, but can you talk about other puts and takes around mix that might be negatively impacting kind of the gross margin and I guess given that the incremental cost of IMFT is probably driven by you taking receipt of the whole joint venture in the month of November why wouldn't that hit get higher as you go into the fiscal second quarter and have it for the full quarter.
David Zinsner: Okay. So yes, let me kind of walk through a little bit of the puts and takes. Obviously pricing is a factor in the expectations around gross margins for the first fiscal quarter. And of course, we don't talk necessarily about forward pricing. But the second piece is cost. And as Sanjay mentioned, our cost declines for fiscal 2020 in total will be kind of high-single digits that's lower than the cost declines we got in fiscal 2019 versus fiscal 2018. And so we are seeing a slower rate of cost declines for DRAM, and that's of course something we've indicated was coming given the complexities that we face in as we migrate nodes. And as we talked about obviously on the NAND side, we're going to have very minimal cost declines as we kind of transition to replacement gate. So those are certainly factors in that, and I would tell you that the first quarter cost declines are very minimal. The third piece is mix. If you look at the mix from just a move to high value solutions, that of course is positive, but what is overshadowing that is the mix of NAND and DRAM. And of course, NAND has a lower gross margin than DRAM. And we will see likely a higher mix of NAND next quarter which will affect gross margins negatively. And then as you pointed out, there's two kind of unusual items I guess in the quarter. One is the change in the useful life of NAND equipment that will be positive, but more than half of that will be offset by underutilization expenses associated with IMFT. So those are kind of all the puts and takes of gross margins. I think it's likely that it will be a little higher from Q1 to Q2 in terms of underutilization expenses, but it was somewhat in the noise. We might be a little bit lower than $150 million of underutilization expense in fiscal Q1, and we might be a little higher than that in fiscal Q2.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC.
Mitchell Steves: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to kind of poke again on the gross margin question that’s asked. But one of the bigger question I have is just with your commentary about pricing getting better, but then you're talking about gross margin is going down on a higher revenue base. So if you offset that with depreciation as well, I mean does that imply that November quarter should be the bottom for gross margins? Or are you guys implying that February could also be down sequentially?
David Zinsner: Well, I think clearly we're talking about NAND getting better. And we are seeing the early signs in DRAM of kind of the fundamentals getting better, demand is coming back, inventories on our balance sheet and the industry's balance sheets are coming down. Of course that hasn't gotten completely to where it needs to be. And also as Sanjay mentioned in his prepared remarks, the market continues to be a bit competitive and so we'll have to see when that all those things come together and supply kind of aligns with demand to drive more healthy market or healthier market for DRAM.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPM.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. On your fiscal 2020 DRAM outlook for high-single digits cost reductions versus fiscal 2019, is that how we should think about your longer-term annualized cost down profile given the higher complexity capital intensity that you are aligned? Or are there some impacts from the pullback in utilizations, drawdown of your own inventories and/or maybe a slower 1Z transition that's impacting the cost down profile as well?
David Zinsner: We definitely have some underutilization expenses in DRAM. Certainly we have that built into our expectations for the first fiscal quarter. It may last into the second fiscal quarter. And so that certainly is an impact, but I would tell you that over time as complexity of these nodes goes up and as capital intensity goes up, the cost declines are going to become more challenging. So the high single-digit will probably not be something we can routinely do year-to-year.
Sanjay Mehrotra: And I’ll just add that we are certainly narrowing the cost gap in terms of DRAM production cost overall. 1Z node is a good example of Micron’s leadership being the first one to introduce the 1Z node with the smallest feature size in the industry. And the result of cost improvements that we are making on DRAM as well as of course the high value solutions that are driving higher mix on the NAND side is a major improvement. 2,500 plus basis point improvement in our EBITDA margins versus the competition compared to the past 2016 timeframe.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Newman with Bernstein.
Mark Newman: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. You talked about inventory down quite a bit Q-on-Q. You gave some numbers on that. Do you have a bit more breakdown on how that compares DRAM versus NAND? And then looking forward to next-gen technology, you've obviously got – it's quite difficult to transition to the replacement gate to NAND. Can you give an update on the timing for that where you are on the 96 layers or where are your current generation [indiscernible] and where – can you give little bit details in the timing to the demand replacement there. Thanks very much. 
Sanjay Mehrotra: So Dave will comment on your inventory part of the question, but let me just address your question on the 96-layers. As we had said before, 96-layer execution has gone very well with the Company in terms of yield ramp. 96-layer technology has given us the fastest yield ramp of any other NAND technologies in the past. So we are very proud of that accomplishment and 96-layer is continuing to ramp during the course of our fiscal year 2020. In fact, 96-layer will be the major driver of our NAND bit growth in fiscal year 2020. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, with respect to replacement gate, we have seen now functionality and yielding dies. We are certainly quite encouraged by that and continue to work on technology and product development. In fiscal year 2020, 64-layer and 96-layer will continue to be the workhorse technologies and our replacement gate technology of course will have a small mix in fiscal year 2020 for us as well. Keep in mind, our first replacement gate node, which will have small production in fiscal year 2020 will be a rather limited node because we'll be deploying it across select set of products. It's our second generation node, which will of course come in the subsequent fiscal year that will give us – position us well and resume the year-over-year strong cost reductions for us. But basically the 96-layer will continue to ramp during fiscal year 2020 for us.
David Zinsner: Okay. So on the inventory question, if you – so we had 143 days of inventory in the third quarter that came down to 131 days in the fourth fiscal quarter. If you kind of break that out between DRAM and NAND, DRAM was meaningfully below that and NAND was meaningfully above that. I would say in terms of days, obviously in absolute dollars, DRAM has more inventory than NAND. I would say that was – you got to remember there are two reasons why inventory was building for NAND. It was building as we kind of slowed down our supply, but customers were working down their inventory. Now the adjustments we've made to our supply both in terms of capital spending reductions and in terms of utilization adjustments, we have brought our inventory down pretty meaningfully this quarter. We expect to bring it down again meaningfully next quarter. On the NAND side, we have elevated levels of inventory, but that's more strategic. What we're trying to do is, have some built up inventory in fiscal 2019 that we can use in fiscal 2020 to support the RG transition because the replacement gate transition will not drive a lot of bit growth. And so in order to support the increased demand next year, we will have to utilize this inventory for that purpose.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore.
C.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to hit on your commentary around DRAM and on the ongoing industry in calendar 2019. Within that, is that largely driven by Huawei, perhaps more aggressive competitors in certain markets, change in mix? I love to hear your thoughts on that. And then as we move into calendar 2020, what are your expectations vis-à-vis the market – for your market share? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So in terms of overall bits, with respect to DRAM growth in terms of revenue, I mean it has primarily been impacted by the customer inventories that were built up last year for the first half. And our overall DRAM shipments are in line with overall, the industry, in this regard. And I think what we said is that the industry demand mid-teens and our overall supply growth during the calendar 2019 to be slightly below the industry of course as a result of some of the underutilization actions that we have taken. And of course, there is an impact of Huawei in terms of our overall business. We had said before that compared to the levels that we anticipated before Huawei's placement on the Entity Listing, our revenue is lower. And of course, we are very much focused on continuing to diversify our revenue base. But yes, I mean, the Huawei Entity Listing does have an effect on some of our shipments to the customer. I mean, some of our overall shipments in the market.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Raji Gill with Needham & Co.
Rajvindra Gill: Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. You had mentioned that you did see some elevated inventory levels in the lower process nodes. I was wondering if you could kind of elaborate on that particular comment.
Sanjay Mehrotra: This is really related to some of our overall production and mix and if some of the older nodes have lower demand compared to our total supply available, and therefore that's where we are primarily running underutilization on the DRAM side. So it really is about the overall demand and this is good inventory that overall will get consumed over time.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. I was wondering if you could help me parse out the CapEx guidance a little bit more in detail. I know last quarter relative to the $9.1 billion you did for the full-year, you talked about roughly $2 billion for kind of cleanroom and facility kind of CapEx. Was that the case? And I think on the basis of that, what is that kind of CapEx spend specifically embedded into your fiscal 2020 guidance?
David Zinsner: Yes. It was a little bit lower than the $2 billion number, but certainly a meaningful part of our spend. And you could probably parse out from what Sanjay said. We expect that number to increase in fiscal 2020, and the opposite is we expect the front-end equipment spend to decrease in fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2019. We also – we'll obviously make another investment in the back-end and we're expecting that to be roughly similar to what we're spending and what would be spent in fiscal 2019.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho.
Vijay Rakesh: Yes. Hi, guys. Just wondering on the same CapEx line, I know you guys talked about equipment CapEx being down 30%, so it looks like close to $5 billion for fiscal 2020. Just wondering what the spit could be on NAND and DRAM? Thanks.
David Zinsner: We don't tend to break that out. But I guess I would just tell you that our plan is to reduce front-end equipment spend in both DRAM and NAND next year.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thank you for taking my question. Two follow-ups. We talked about the demand trends are positive, but I want to get a better assessment of how do you see data centers. There has been some conversation in industry that data center demand is seasonal. Some argue that it is better than seasonal. And Sanjay, I want to get your view, how do you see the data center demand for both SSDs and DRAM is tracking. And in that context, I'm surprised with your NAND bit demand projection for next year. This is well below a historical trend of near 40%. What do you attribute this NAND demand trend into 2020, which in my opinion is well below a trend line?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So with respect to the NAND demand trend in calendar year 2020, I mean, just keep in mind that in calendar 2018 the industry grew by approximately 45%, in calendar year 2019, again, by about 45% or so, low 40s to 45%. And that, then definitely, I mean, when you look at a multiyear CAGR, I think, it does lead to calendar year 2020 to be approximately in low-30s or in that range, high-20s to low-30s kind of range in terms of calendar year 2020. And I think what you have to realize is that with such aggressive pricing decline that had occurred in NAND over 2018 and 2019 timeframe, elasticity definitely has kicked in substantially, and as we said, pricing environment actually has started improving in NAND. And some of the average capacity growth that you perhaps would have seen, next year actually has been pulled in faster into this year as a result of some of these aggressive price declines that have occurred and have driven the usage of higher capacities in terms of increasing average capacities of SSDs, increasing the attach rate of SSDs, as well as continuing to drive higher average capacities in the smartphone market as well. So these are some of the factors that are absolutely playing an important role in terms of our assessment that for calendar year 2020 the year-over-year bit growth will be high-20s to low-30s range. Again, keep in mind that we still are few months away from next calendar year and we, of course, will continue to assess the overall industry demand trend, but this is our latest projection on that. Your first question was around cloud, and let me just point out that, cloud definitely demand grew nicely for us on the DRAM side in FQ4. Strong demand increases. And yes, the cloud demand from time-to-time can be somewhat lumpy. However, overall demand growth trends on the cloud side continue to be solid. In fact, we see cloud demand consumption both for DRAM as well as for SSDs continue to be higher than the average of the respective DRAM and the NAND industries. So overall, cloud again, new architectures, new CPU platforms that are really enabling more channels, as well as usage of higher density of DRAMs, as well as again, as I spoke earlier, the trend of AI applications all of this is driving greater usage of memory and storage in cloud. So cloud, we see as absolutely strong. Cloud customers inventories have normalized and it's back to normal levels. Other than any aspects perhaps in China, as I talked about, of maybe some element of strategic inventory build by certain customers. But overall the cloud demand trends are solid.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.
Ambrish Srivastava: Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to get back to NAND for fiscal 2020, and I just wanted to reconcile the comments you've made, and wanted to make sure I'm walking away with the right takeaway, is that you have limited cost down. And then you also talked about very low gross margin and then you're also selling from already built inventory. So what's the tradeoff between all these factors as I compare your profitability in NAND versus competition in fiscal 2020?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So I think in fiscal 2020 the main focus for us on NAND will be to continue to increase the mix of high value solutions. I think in mobile, you have seen us increase managed NAND solutions in terms of share gains substantially. And I’ve reported in my prepared remarks on the tremendous progress that we have made with our mobile business, and most of it is driven by the progress on the managed NAND side and we plan to continue to increase that part of the business in fiscal year 2020. I also spoke about SSDs, SSD was certainly a headwind in terms of share opportunities for us in fiscal year 2019. And as we now have expanded our portfolio of NVMe solutions actually have introduced our first NVMe solutions during fiscal year 2019. Now we can leverage those solutions to expand our opportunities in fiscal year 2020 and we certainly look forward to gaining share and assuming gaining share in SSD on fiscal year 2020. So I think those are important pieces of our strategy of continuing to drive healthier revenue mix of NAND in fiscal year 2020. And of course, we are extremely focused on cost reductions on assembly, test and non-memory [bound] as well which are important factors particularly when it comes to products like SSDs or Multichip Packages, et cetera. And we’re making good progress on cost reductions on non-memory part of the [bound] as well. So these are all opportunities for us in fiscal year 2020. But no questions that at the die levels, our cost reduction capabilities will be overall limited in terms of the cost reductions due to the RG transition that we talked about earlier.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Mr. Moore, your line is open.
Joseph Moore: Yes. Hi, can you hear me?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Yes.
Joseph Moore: Yes. I wonder if you could talk about your forecasted demand will accelerate next year on the DRAM side, can you kind of break that down between units and content and just generally, what's your expectation for DRAM content per smartphones and service next year?
Sanjay Mehrotra: I think on the smartphone side, the average DRAM content if you look at it this year, it increased by nearly 25%, slightly above three was the average – 3 gigabyte was the average capacity last year, expected to be in calendar year 2019 around 4. And pretty similar double-digit gains continuing. 5G, if you look at Mobile World Congress, phones that were introduced there were 8 gigabyte and 12 gigabyte DRAM density in those phones. So as 5G phones start selling in the marketplace, some of those phones are already introduced in the market today in some parts of the world and this will continue to build momentum during calendar year 2020 and years beyond. Those phones will also require more DRAM. And again the phones are becoming more and more feature-rich, more AI applications are being built into the smartphones today and rich video and imaging capability and lot more intelligence behind all those applications, they require more DRAM as well. So looking at next year, we will certainly be seeing continuing average capacity increases next year as well. In fact, in calendar year 2020, if you look at industry projections, average capacity is expected to increase another 20% next year going to something closer to 5 gigabyte per smartphone. But as I said before, the DRAM is not only about smartphone, its other applications related to server as well where the average content continues to increase, as well as the average content continues to increase in PCs as well with the applications such as gaming, driving higher need for more DRAM.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now all disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-06-25 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and thank you for your patience. You've joined the Third Fiscal Quarter 2019 Financial Call for Micron Technology. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference may be recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Head of Investor Relations, Farhan Ahmad. Sir, you may begin.
Farhan Ahmad: Thank you, and welcome to Micron Technology's third fiscal quarter 2019 financial conference call.

Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after today’s date to conform these statements to actual results. I will now turn the call over to Sanjay.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Farhan. Good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered solid fiscal third quarter results despite headwinds from industry oversupply and steeper-than-expected price declines. This financial performance reflects our continued strong execution on technology advancement, product cost reduction, and pricing discipline. Our healthy balance sheet, structurally improved profitability, and winning team set the foundation for us to emerge even stronger when the industry environment recovers. We are confident that the long-term demand outlook for memory and storage is compelling, driven by broad secular trends such as AI, autonomous vehicles, 5G, and IoT. The new Micron is well positioned to take advantage of these trends, with innovative products, a responsive supply chain, and well-established relationships with customers worldwide.  Over the last few months, customer inventory improvements have progressed largely in line with our expectations in most end markets. This reinforces our confidence that bit demand for DRAM will return to healthy year-over-year growth in the second half of calendar 2019. NAND bit demand is also increasing in most markets as elasticity kicks in, in response to price declines over the last year. Even as customer inventory levels of DRAM and NAND improve across most end markets, producer inventory levels are elevated. Although previously announced CapEx cuts will start to impact industry supply in the second half of the calendar year, our assessment is that further cuts in CapEx and bit supply will be required to return the industry to a healthy supply-demand balance. I will discuss our actions on this front shortly, but first, let me provide an overview of our FQ3 results. At our 2018 Analyst Day, we discussed our priorities related to technology, cost competitiveness, and high-value solutions. Solid execution on these strategies has now yielded over 2,000 basis points of EBITDA margin improvement relative to our peers since 2016. Unlike the last downturn during which Micron’s relative profitability declined, in this downturn our relative profitability has continued to improve. In DRAM, we are on track to deliver good cost declines in fiscal 2019. We continue to increase the mix of 1Y nanometer and are making excellent progress toward ramping 1Z next fiscal year. In April, we broke ground on our new cleanroom in Taichung, Taiwan, and earlier this month we announced the opening of a new cleanroom in Hiroshima, Japan. These cleanroom expansions will enable future DRAM node transitions of our existing wafer capacity. In NAND, we continue to ramp our 96-layer 3D NAND and are on track to achieve healthy cost declines in fiscal 2019. We continue to make progress on our 128-layer 3D NAND, which uses replacement gate technology. As we discussed on the last call, we expect a partial transition to this node, with the full portfolio transition occurring on the second-generation replacement gate node. In addition to these node transitions in DRAM and NAND, we are also improving our cost structure by increasing the percentage of products produced through captive back-end packaging facilities. These facilities now account for more than half of our total assembly requirements. Our captive back-end operations are tightly integrated with our front-end systems, enabling greater product customization, tighter quality control, improved responsiveness to shifts in demand, and lower costs. High-value solutions now account for over two-thirds of NAND revenues. We made further progress in strengthening our SSD portfolio with the launch of our 9,300 data center NVMe SSDs for cloud and enterprise markets. We more than doubled revenue shipments of our new NVMe client SSD to large PC OEMs, and more customer qualifications are in progress. As a reminder, this new NVME drive is built with our own controller technology. QLC SSD bit shipments increased approximately 75% sequentially, driven by growth of our consumer NVMe SSDs. Overall, the Micron team continues to execute well on cost reductions and on high-value solutions. While we are operating in a difficult industry environment today, our progress is visible in our reported profitability and increases our confidence in our ability to drive long-term shareholder value. Now turning to highlights by end markets. Our mobile business was impacted by U.S. trade restrictions, which Dave and I will discuss later in the call. Looking ahead, innovations such as 5G, foldable phones, and advanced cameras will drive growth for our products. Our portfolio of Mobile DRAM products features best-in-class power consumption. On low-power DDR5, we are leading the industry and recently started sampling the highest-density die in the market. We continue to make good progress on our managed NAND products as well, and recently launched our second-generation UFS product with best-in-class endurance. Within the data center market, cloud customers are turning the corner on inventories, and most are approaching normal inventory levels. Our cloud DRAM bit shipments grew sequentially in the fiscal third quarter, exceeding our expectations, and early trends suggest strong sequential growth for the FQ4. Enterprise customer inventories are taking somewhat longer to normalize than we had previously expected. We continue to sample and secure qualifications on 64 gigabyte DDR4 server modules built with our 1Y nanometer DRAM. In graphics, we saw robust sequential growth as customer inventories normalized. We expanded our customer base for our high-performance GDDR6, which positions us well for strong growth in the second half of calendar 2019. In the PC market, DRAM bit shipments returned to growth as CPU shortages started to improve. Looking ahead, we expect strong sequential DRAM bit growth in our fiscal fourth quarter as laptop sales improve. In automotive, while global auto sales are slow, content growth remains strong, driven by innovations in ADAS and infotainment systems. Micron is well-positioned to benefit from the growth opportunity in this market given our leading market share, deep customer relationships, and high-quality products. We recently began ramping shipments with an industry-leading OEM for their most advanced autonomous system, which uses 16 gigabytes of our low-power DRAM. Before talking about the market outlook, I want to provide some comments related to Huawei. As you know, effective May 16, the US Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, or “BIS,” added Huawei and 68 of its non-US affiliates to the BIS Entity List. To ensure compliance, Micron immediately suspended shipments to Huawei and began a review of Micron products sold to Huawei to determine whether they are subject to the imposed restrictions. Through this review, we determined that we could lawfully resume shipping a subset of current products because they are not subject to Export Administration Regulations and Entity List restrictions. We have started shipping some orders of those products to Huawei in the last two weeks. However, there is considerable ongoing uncertainty surrounding the Huawei situation, and we are unable to predict the volumes or time periods over which we’ll be able to ship products to Huawei. Micron will continue to comply with all government and legal requirements, just as we do in all our operations globally. Of course, we cannot predict whether additional government actions may further impact our ability to ship to Huawei. Now turning to the market outlook for DRAM. As I mentioned earlier, we have seen early signs of bit demand recovery in most DRAM end markets. Based on our assessment of customer inventory improvement, we anticipate robust bit demand growth for the industry in the second half of the calendar year, compared to the weak demand in the first half.  Our view of calendar 2019 industry DRAM bit demand growth is in the mid-teens, with industry supply growing mid-to-high teens. Despite the early signs of recovery in DRAM bit demand, the excess supply and resulting higher producer inventory levels have created a challenging pricing environment. We expect that the strengthening demand growth will begin to contribute to an improving trend in producer inventory later in calendar 2019. Turning to our supply, at Micron our focus continues to be on taking prudent steps to help bring the DRAM market back to stabilization. We are continuing the previously announced wafer start reductions of approximately 5%, which we expect will bring our DRAM bit supply growth for calendar 2019 close to market demand growth. The overall NAND market remains oversupplied from the accelerated supply growth driven by the industry transition from 2D NAND production to 3D NAND. Our NAND industry bit demand growth expectations for calendar 2019 are unchanged at the mid-30% range. We continue to target our bit shipments to be close to the industry demand growth rate. Since our last earnings call, we have taken actions to further adjust wafer starts from the previously announced 5% reduction to now approximately 10%, which will result in lower supply growth in the second half of the calendar year. These reductions are the result of both capital optimizations to reuse more existing equipment for our 96-layer conversion, as well as lowering some of our legacy NAND capacity, which we announced previously. While we still believe the NAND industry supply is growing above demand this year, the market is showing signs of increased elasticity stemming from recent price declines.  We are optimistic that the overall NAND market will start to stabilize in the second half of calendar 2019. With the higher levels of macro uncertainty and the relatively high levels of inventory on our balance sheet, we are taking decisive action to manage our DRAM and NAND bit production. In addition to the wafer start reductions that we discussed we are also taking action on  CapEx. Earlier this year, we announced a reduction in fiscal 2019 CapEx forecast from $10.5 billion plus or minus 5% at the start of the year, to approximately $9 billion now. For fiscal 2020, we plan for CapEx to be meaningfully lower than fiscal 2019. While our CapEx plans are still being finalized, we seek to balance our manufacturing investments with our free cash flow objectives. I’ll now turn it over to Dave to provide financial results of our fiscal third quarter and guidance for the fourth quarter.
Dave Zinsner: Thanks, Sanjay. Micron’s fiscal third quarter results were within the guided revenue range and above the guided EPS range that we provided on our last call. We also generated healthy levels of free cash flow and made further progress on our share repurchase program. Total fiscal third quarter revenue of approximately $4.8 billion was at the midpoint of our guidance range and was down 39% on a year-over-year basis and down 18% sequentially from FQ2.  Both DRAM and NAND revenue were negatively impacted by restriction on sales to Huawei, without which we would have reached the high end of our revenue guidance. DRAM revenue was approximately $3 billion, representing 64% of total revenue. DRAM revenue declined 45% year-over-year and 19% sequentially from fiscal second quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, the DRAM ASP decline approached 20%, while bit shipments were roughly flat. If not for the impact of Huawei, bit shipments in DRAM would have increased sequentially as we had guided on our last quarter’s earnings call. NAND revenue was approximately $1.5 billion, representing 31% of total revenue. NAND revenue declined 25% relative to fiscal third quarter 2018 and declined 18% sequentially from the fiscal second quarter. Overall NAND ASPs declined in the mid-teen’s percent range, while shipment quantities declined in the mid-single-digit percent range compared to the prior quarter. Adjusting for the Huawei impact, bit shipments came in better than our expectation due to stronger component sales. Now turning to our revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the Compute and Networking Business Unit was $2.1 billion, down 48% year-over-year and 13% from the prior quarter. Lower pricing across major market segments continued to be the leading cause of lower revenue. However, normalized customer inventory levels led to shipment volume growth in fiscal third quarter, particularly in graphics and client. Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $1.2 billion, down 33% year-over-year and down 27% from fiscal second quarter due in part to lower shipments to Huawei. Lower pricing and DRAM volume drove the quarter-over-quarter decline. Our managed NAND portfolio continued to show strength in fiscal third quarter with bit shipments increasing by over 200% year-over-year. The Embedded Business Unit revenue of $700 million was down 22% from the prior year and down 12% from fiscal second quarter. Revenue was adversely impacted by broad macroeconomic weakness, weaker pricing, and inventory adjustments in the consumer segment. Automotive and industrial, which represented almost 75% of EBU revenue showed strong margin resilience, with gross margins down only 300 basis points from the last fiscal quarter. Finally, the Storage Business Unit third quarter revenue was $813 million, down 29% year-over-year and down 20% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential decline was driven by competitive pricing and an unfavorable comparison on component volumes coming off a large one-time sale we completed in the prior fiscal quarter. The consolidated gross margin for fiscal third quarter was 39%, compared to 61% in the prior year and 50% in fiscal second quarter. Lower pricing in both DRAM and NAND was the primary driver of the lower margin in the fiscal quarter. Gross margins were also negatively impacted by approximately 200 basis points, due to underutilization charges related to IMFT.  U.S. tariffs on imports from China were less than 30 basis point impact to gross margins, as we have successfully mitigated approximately 90% of the impact from tariffs. Fiscal third quarter NAND gross margins remained above 25%. Operating expenses of $774 million were well within our guided range. As we’ve said on prior calls, our goal with OpEx is to remain disciplined with respect to expense control, while continuing to invest in future products and technologies throughout the market cycle. Operating expenses also benefited from the strong execution on qualification of our 1Z nanometer mobile-DRAM product ahead of our internal schedule. We delivered solid profitability in the fiscal third quarter with operating income of $1.1 billion, representing 23% of revenue. This margin is down 28 percentage points year-over-year and down 13 percentage points from FQ2. Non-GAAP taxes included $162 million of benefits in FQ3, due to a favorable state tax law change and a change in our annual tax rate from 10.5% to 9%.  Non-GAAP earnings per share in the fiscal third quarter was $1.05, down from $3.15 in the year-ago quarter and down from $1.71 in the prior quarter. Fiscal third quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.15 higher due to the $162 million of tax benefits. Turning to cash flows and capital spending, we generated $2.7 billion in cash from operations in the fiscal third quarter, representing 57% of revenues. Capital spending, net of third-party contributions, was approximately $2.2 billion, down from $2.4 billion in the prior quarter. We still expect fiscal 2019 CapEx at approximately $9 billion, however we expect meaningfully lower CapEx in fiscal 2020. In the fiscal third quarter, our adjusted free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less net CapEx, was approximately $500 million, compared to $2.2 billion in the year-ago quarter and $1 billion in the fiscal second quarter. We bought back approximately $157 million of stock in the fiscal third quarter, representing 3.8 million shares.  For the fiscal year-to-date, we’ve returned $2.7 billion to shareholders in the form of share buybacks, which represents approximately 70% of our year-to-date free cash flow. Combined with the redemptions of outstanding converts, we have reduced outstanding share count by over 8% since fiscal third quarter 2018. We will continue to prudently manage capital according to our philosophy of maintaining liquidity throughout the cycle, investing in capital assets to enable cost-effective node transitions and back-end cost competitiveness, and returning over 50% of free cash flow to shareholders. Inventory ended the quarter at $4.9 billion, increasing from $4.4 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter. The fiscal third quarter ended with 151 days of inventory outstanding, or 143 days using our average inventory balance for the fiscal third quarter. As we mentioned on the last call, calendar 2020 NAND bit supply will be constrained as we make the transition to replacement gate. To meet expected bit demand growth, we are carrying higher levels of NAND inventory in calendar 2019 and 2020. We also project to carry higher-than-normal levels of DRAM inventory in calendar 2019 as industry supply and demand work toward getting into balance. Total cash ended the quarter at $7.9 billion, down quarter-over-quarter, largely as a result of our $1.4 billion redemption of our Series G convertible notes announced last quarter and completed in FQ3. Total liquidity exceeded $10 billion at quarter-end, while we maintained a healthy balance sheet. In the quarter, we announced that the close of the IMFT joint venture acquisition will be October 31, which is during our fiscal first quarter of 2020. We expect to pay approximately $1.4 billion for Intel’s share of IMFT. A portion of the payment will also be used to repay member debt financing, which at the end of the fiscal third quarter was approximately $860 million. Now, turning to our financial outlook. Both the DRAM and NAND markets remain over-supplied. Having said that, we are starting to see some signs of bit demand improvement. As Sanjay mentioned, we expect strong growth in our DRAM bit shipments for the cloud, graphics, and PC markets in fiscal fourth quarter, followed by more normal bit growth in the fiscal first quarter. In NAND, while the industry is benefitting from elasticity kicking in, our bit shipment growth in FQ4 will be limited, due to the ongoing transition of our SSD portfolio. With that in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.5 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in the range of 29% plus or minus 150 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $785 million, plus or minus $25 million. Based on a share count of approximately 1.13 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $0.45, plus or minus $0.07. In closing, despite the industry and geopolitical challenges, Micron continues to execute on our key initiatives and remains on strong financial footing. We will continue to draw on our strong relationships with our customers and manage through this cycle with a focus on gross margins and free cash flow. I’ll now turn the call over to Sanjay for some concluding remarks.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Dave. Clearly, fiscal 2019 has been challenging for both Micron and the industry. While we continue to believe that the industry is structurally stronger, the confluence of events that impacted this year was unprecedented. Still, we have fared better due to the tremendous progress we have made on improving our product costs, advancing our technology, and increasing the mix of high value solutions. Recent industry financial results show that Micron’s profitability and balance sheet are best-in-class. Having said that, we are not resting on our recent accomplishments and are continuing to raise the bar for ourselves. Our CapEx and expense controls reflect our focus on profitability and free cash flow. With the economic and trade challenges facing the industry, the near term continues to be uncertain. But looking beyond these challenges, I’m excited about Micron’s future. We are in the early innings of growth in cloud computing, and the value of data in the new economy is going to drive secular growth in numerous memory and storage-intensive applications. AI, autonomous vehicles, 5G, and IoT will drive significant improvements in our lives, and we look forward to bringing the value of our innovative, market-leading solutions to our customers. In April, we issued our fourth annual sustainability report, which details Micron’s commitment to enhancing the world we live in through our products and our business practices. We achieved perfect scores on industry-standard environmental and social audits of our facilities in 2018 and 2019. Our ongoing focus and improvements in sustainable practices is a competitive differentiator for both our customers and our employees, and an important part of the transformation we are driving at Micron. I’m energized by the potential ahead of us and proud of the culture of innovation and execution that we are building. We will now open for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Evercore. Your line is open.
C.J. Muse: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, I was hoping you could provide a little more granularity on Huawei. You talked about the ability to sell subset of products, can you walk through, I guess, where you are allowed, where you are not? They are, I believe a [13%] customer at least quarter fiscal year. What kind of impact do you expect as we proceed in the coming quarters across both DRAM and NAND?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, as I said in the prepared remarks, after the Huawei was placed on entity list, we began review of our products against the export administration required regulations and through that analysis we determined that certain of our products, a subset of our products that we were previously shipping to Huawei could continue to ship because it is lawful it is compliant to those export regulations. And you know of course, it had impact as Dave noted. In our FQ3, it had an impact because we could not ship at that time any product to them of nearly $200 million. And for FQ4, there would be impact to our revenue. What I would say is, that our revenue with Huawei in FQ4 would be less than what it otherwise would have been if Huawei was not on the entity listing. And of course, as we look ahead beyond FQ4, if Huawei continues to be on the entity list then in fiscal year 2020 as well, we would have an impact compared to what our revenue with Huawei would have been if they were not on the entity listing. Of course, we are a supplier to all customers in all end markets across the globe and we will – and our presence with several of those other customers is growing in terms of our penetration there, in terms of our share there. And we will continue to work on adjusting those, but we would not be able to make up in fiscal year 2020 if this were to continue the full shortfall and all though we plan to make a part of it through other parts of the business.
C.J. Muse: That's very helpful. And if I could …
Sanjay Mehrotra: And it affects both our DRAM, as well as the NAND side of the business.
C.J. Muse: Okay, great. Thank you. And if I could follow up on CapEx, you talked about a meaningful cut. I guess, is meaningful meaning [indiscernible] territory? And as part of that, is it more focused on DRAM, NAND, both, how should we think about the implications there? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, with respect to CapEx, we have said meaningful reduction in CapEx from the fiscal year 2019 levels. And we will provide more details in the next call as we finalize our plans. Of course, our goal is to have our long-term considerations in mind with respect to technology and product cost capability, but most importantly to have our supply bit growth aligned with our expectations of demand bit growth. And when we look at supply bit growth, of course, we keep in mind the inventory that we are carrying from fiscal year 2019 into fiscal year 2020 for both DRAM, as well as NAND, which will help us supply some of the demand requirement in fiscal year 2020 and enable us to reduce our CapEx requirements in fiscal year 2020 and our CapEx management, of course, applies to both NAND, as well as DRAM.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Newman of Bernstein. Your question please.
Mark Newman: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my call, taking my question. And the first question really following on Huawei, can you give a little bit more quantification on how much the 13% or so revenue you expect you will be able to continue to export to Huawei? And can you give us some guidance also for your bit growth for this next quarter? I don't think you have mentioned that yet on the earnings – on the guidance, if you can mention about your expectation for bit growth for the following quarter? And I have a follow-up question. Thanks.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, with respect to Huawei, as I've said before, our revenue expectation in fiscal Q4 is less than what it would have been without Huawei being on the entity list. Beyond that we don't really get into specifics in terms of revenue etcetera on a customer by customer basis. Of course, our revenue expectation with Huawei is baked into the guidance, revenue guidance that Dave provided for FQ4 of $4.5 billion plus or minus $200 million. And your second question, with respect to …
Dave Zinsner: So, on DRAM bit growth, we said it would be up meaningfully in the fourth quarter, NAND will be more modest given the environment.
Mark Newman: Okay. Thanks, thanks very much Dave and Sanjay. My final question is really taking a step back and looking at the industry, you know clearly it has been the quite challenging year, this year with the oversupply, but just looking forward to 2020 with the pretty severe cuts, you guys are making on utilization and CapEx and with similar cuts from some of your competitors in Asia, I'm just curious what you think for next year, I guess it very much depends on the economic outlook, which is a little bit unpredictable at the moment, but looking forward to 2020, do you not think that there could be a danger of potential under supply at some point next year? I'm just curious how you're thinking about that because to me, this level of utilization and CapEx, it seems like inevitably there will be a period of under supply coming, just a matter of time.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, as we have said, the industry is in oversupply right now, both in DRAM, as well as in NAND. And while demand is increasing in the second half both for NAND and DRAM, the oversupply situation does persist and we have talked about in DRAM, challenging pricing environment and therefore it's important that CapEx cuts are made, as well as supply bit growth has managed to bring the supply bit growth in line with the demand growth, as well as over time to bring inventories in line with expectations as well. So, we are not providing a fiscal year 2020 guidance at this point, but all of the actions that we are taking here are really targeted to restore the industry demand and supply balance over the course of next few quarters.
Mark Newman: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Pitzer: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions. Sanjay, congratulations on the solid execution given the industry conditions. Just going back to the CapEx questions, I would argue Sanjay that one of the biggest strategic initiatives you’ve had has been to try to close the cost gap with your peers. And clearly CapEx is a pretty important tool in which to do that, you guys are sort of bucking the trend this fiscal year with CapEx actually up slightly versus peers that have actually taken it down. I'm just kind of curious, help us get some comfort level that despite the cuts you're talking about for the fiscal year 2020 you're still very much on plan relative to closing those cost gaps with your peers?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, certainly as you noted, we have made tremendous improvement in our cost position and with respect to our peers and that reflects in our financial performance. As was noted in the prepared remarks, our margin improvement, relative margin improvement from previous times has really improved by 2,000 basis points and that's because of our execution on the cost front, as well as on the execution on the high value solutions front. And of course, we have more room to go with respect to cost competitiveness, as well as strengthening our high value solutions portfolio. So, we are extremely focused on this and you know as we look at driving our future opportunities, we of course when we make our CapEx decisions, we make them based on cost competitiveness off our supply in the future and of course, keeping in mind our free cash flow considerations and most important is that our total supply available to us coming from our inventory and coming from our supply bit growth should be matching with our demand expectations going forward over the course of next few quarters and to continue to improve our inventory position. But on the cost side, we feel very good about the 1Y and 1Z progress on DRAM, as well as we feel good about our 96-layer. And overall, even with the CapEx reductions that we’re talking about, we'll be in a good position with respect to cost both in DRAM and NAND next year. Of course we have talked about in NAND, our first generation replacement gate node will be a small node, in the sense that it will be deployed across a small set of products and we will not have any significant cost benefit from that first generation replacement gate node, but the second generation replacement gate node will give us meaningful cost benefit, compared to the last generations of floating gate node. So, we absolutely are on top of the game in terms of managing to our cost objectives.
Dave Zinsner: I'd just add that, you know, Sanjay already mentioned this drive to high value solutions. In other way we can improve our gross margins, but also the node transitions isn't the only way we affect the cost of the product and so one example is, for example, the back-end we're very acutely focused on the back-end we are bringing some of that activity that we were doing that was being outsourced internally. We think we can improve our cost structure in that regard to. So, there are many ways we can drive the cost to improve it.
Sanjay Mehrotra: And one thing I would add is, in terms of our overall CapEx that you mentioned, of course, as you know that in fiscal year 2019, we had meaningful part of our CapEx around $2 billion that was actually tied to facilities, cleanroom expansions to enable technology transitions. And this facility spend, may not be the same from one manufacturer to the other manufacturers, but for us that was a meaningful part. Again, as noted in our remarks before, to prepare us for technology transitions and not targeting any of that cleanroom space for any meaningful capacity, but really for technology transition.
John Pitzer: Thanks Sanjay. And then David, just on inventory, it's clearly a key metric that investors are looking at. I'm kind of curious is how we should think about inventory levels exiting the fiscal fourth quarter? And as you answer the question, clearly the inventory is somewhat a reflection of where we are in the cycle, but you've got sort of the added burden of wanting to build some NAND inventory as you make this transition to replacement gate. So, how would inventories look if you sort of normalize for that? And then lastly as part of the question, I apologize, utilization coming down, CapEx coming down is a good way of controlling inventory, so was the potential for write-downs, can you just talk about how you're thinking about the value of the inventory in this sort of environment?
Dave Zinsner: A three-part question, John. Okay, so the inventories obviously are elevated right now. As you point out, one of the big drivers of our increased inventory level is in NAND. And that is kind of by design for us. We are trying to build up some inventory going into 2020, fiscal 2020 for us because we are going to make this transition to replacement gate. Replacement gate doesn't drive very much bit growth for us in the first node in replacement gate. And so, we'll need to draw on our inventory in order to meet demand, and that's – I don't know the exact number, but that's a decent chunk of the [overage] in terms of days. The other aspect of the elevated level of inventory is in DRAM. That was a little bit more a function of pretty good bit growth in the first couple of quarters of the calendar year of 2019 and of course we had had customers working down their inventories and so inventory was building up in our balance sheet. We do expect now that we're in a place, Sanjay mentioned that we're seeing inventories get to be in a good place in the cloud space, in the graphic space, in the PC space. And so, we would expect to start to see inventories start to come down now.  We think we'll be in a relatively good spot by the end of the calendar year, may not be at quote unquote optimal levels, but certainly in a healthier place and then quick quickly after that I would expect DRAM to be in a good place. From a write down perspective, we did write down about $40 million of inventory this quarter specific to Huawei. We finished goods inventory with Huawei that does not look like that's going to get sold, so we did reserve that. Outside of that, from a kind of an obsolescence perspective, we don't see really any risk with the inventory we're carrying. We think it's very good inventory, it got a good cost position, very good demand with that inventory. So, unlikely to have any issue as it relates to obsolescence. The other of course area, you have to concern yourself with is the, any sort of lower cost to market issue with the inventory. I think you can kind of guess by the quality of our gross margins that we are not really in danger of having any write-down associated with lower cost to market. So, outside of these kind of one-off issues that we deal with from time to time, like we did with Huawei this quarter I don't really see a big issue with inventory in terms of write-downs or reserves.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So before going to the next question, I just wanted to make a small correction. In the prepared comments, I mentioned that QLC shipments were up approximately 75%, I meant to say that QLC bit shipments were up 75% quarter-over-quarter. So, just wanted to make that correction. And now I think we can move on to the next question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava of BMO Capital. Your question please.
Ambrish Srivastava: Hi, thank you very much. Sanjay, good to see the discipline here on the CapEx and also with Dave’s focus on free cash flow. I was just a little confused, I want to make sure I understood this. If we go – and I appreciate that you don't want to talk about any specific customer, but if you go back to the reported last two quarters and if you triangulate that if you exclude Huawei that will mean that bit shipments would be at best up single-digit. So, the question is in your CapEx thinking for fiscal 2020, how are you handicapping the Huawei impact? Are you expecting this to continue to be on that list and hence your CapEx, lower CapEx includes a certain amount of capacity being taken offline because of that, what's the right way to think about it? And then I had a quick follow-up.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, I think we will be able to provide you more details related to fiscal year 2020 CapEx etcetera in our next earnings call. I would just point out that there is obviously considerable uncertainty here. As you can all see from the rather fluid situation with respect to Huawei, as well as with respect to U.S., China trade matters and of course we are just staying focused on optimizing what we can control, and really remaining nimble in our actions.  You have seen that how over the course of last one year we have for fiscal year 2019 managed our CapEx down from $10.5 billion plus, minus 5% to $9 billion now. So, we continue to stay vigilant and we are making decisive actions with respect to meaningful CapEx reductions in fiscal year 2020. But with respect to the further details, we will be in a better position to provide you information at the next earnings call.
Ambrish Srivastava: Okay, I appreciate that Sanjay. And then as a quick follow-up, and it's not a multi-part day for you, what's the AR or DSO target that we should be thinking about as we go through the next couple of quarters? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Yes. So, it got up there and we did kind of work it down this quarter. I think we got it down to about 62 days. I would say ideally, it should be in the 50s, it was a little bit of a mix challenge this quarter that kind of drove it up a bit. And there is a couple of customers that have extended terms and they kind of hit us at that point, but ideally, we'd like to be somewhere in the mid-50s.
Ambrish Srivastava: Okay, thank you. Good luck.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Danely of Citi. Your question please.
Chris Danely: Thanks guys. You said you've mitigated I think 90% of the tariff so far. Now we're looking at another $300 billion in tariffs. Can you estimate the approximate impact to your business if that goes through?
Sanjay Mehrotra: I would say that as we of course, we don't know for sure what the list looks like. We have a general sense based on what we've seen there is minimal impact from the incremental list. Most of what affects us was contemplated in the first two 1A, 1B, and then the second list.
Chris Danely: Got it. And then for my follow-up. Sanjay talked about 5G and the big driver with the Huawei issue is that impacting the development of 5G, have you seen any change in like the ongoing development of the standards out there?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, I think it is too soon to tell. And keep in mind that in certain countries 5G has already started to be deployed, such as Korea and there are of course leading suppliers, other than Huawei as well for 5G. So, will remain to be seen how this deployment occurs over the course of next few quarters, in particular here. But there is no doubt that you know 5G will bring about greater applications for memory and storage, not only in smartphones, but also in machine-to-machine on the IoT front. And all of this will drive greater demand for memory and storage and we remain absolutely well prepared, of course, in a flexible fashion to meet the growing demand requirements for the business. That 5G, we think will provide over the course of next many years. But near term, in terms of exactly what happens with respect to Huawei aspects, I think really it is too soon to tell.
Chris Danely: Okay, thanks a lot, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. In DRAM, given the transition to 1Y and early 1Z move, can you guys just help us understand qualitatively your cost reduction profile as you move to the second half of this calendar year? Maybe compare that versus the cost downs in the first half of this year.
Sanjay Mehrotra: With respect to the cost declines, of course, we are continuing to execute well with respect to our nodes transitions, as well as continuing to drive cost declines the 1Y and 1Z nodes that you talked about, and we are on plan in terms of ramping up these nodes as well. And as I said before, we don't break out the cost reductions on first half versus second half. Of course, our expectations of cost reductions are baked into for FQ4, the gross margin guidance, as well as of course that takes into account our price decline assumptions as well for FQ4. So, all of that is really baked into it, we don't break it down, but keep in mind that as the new technology nodes advance, the cost reduction coming from new technology nodes is less and less compared to the prior nodes just because as we have explained several times before they naturally give you – given the challenges of scaling less per wafer bit growth capability and less cost reduction capability.
Harlan Sur: Yes, thanks for the insights there. And then back in April, the team announced its 9300 series NVMe, this is their new cloud in enterprise, the SSD family. I think you guys have had solid momentum in cloud and enterprise with your SATA family and that's helped to sustain a better margin profile for the NAND business. So, what's the design win momentum been like on the 9300 series and when do you anticipate your cloud customers to start ramping these new NVMe products? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: As we have discussed in the past that we would be introducing over the course of our fiscal year 2019, actually during calendar year 2019, our NVMe products and we started that first with consumer NVMe and later with our OEM NVMe that we talked about today. And now also for cloud and enterprise applications NVMe drive and these will take some period of time over the course of next few months in terms of getting qualified by customers, in terms of gaining traction with customers and that's why we had mentioned that 2019 will basically be a year of transition for us from SATA to NVMe. I just want to remind you that couple of years ago, Micron did not actually have investments in NVMe product development. We did very well and are continuing to do very well in SATA as you noted, and we began to significantly increase our investments in NVMe product development couple of years ago, and it takes a while to have these products in the marketplace. So, in 2020, as our NVMe solutions get adopted by our customers and as we ramp those into production, we do expect to be gaining share with NVMe all throughout the 2020 timeframe.
Harlan Sur: Thanks Sanjay.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri of UBS. Your question please.
Timothy Arcuri: And that's been asked a couple of times. And I'm just trying to figure out how lower CapEx, you're going to cut CapEx by a couple of billion and you're certainly cutting wafer starts quite a bit, how that does ultimately have some negative impact on your costs? I think you've been costing down in DRAM, maybe low to mid-teens and the expectation was that you'd be down somewhere that 2020 would be kind of another good year for DRAM cost downs and you've been down kind of like mid-20s in NAND. So, yet it sounds like you're saying that it does not having much of an effect on your costs, so I'm just trying to fit those two things? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: No, I'm not saying that it will not have effect on cost. What I'm saying is that we will be in good position with cost because our technologies – underlying technologies, give us good cost reduction capabilities from one node to the next node. Overall, from our cost point of view, we'll be in good position and for NAND I'll just remind you that you know our CMOS under the array technology gives us the smallest die size in the industry and that has meaningful implications with respect to the cost competitiveness that we have. So, overall, we feel good about the technology and the production mix that we will be driving through the remainder of fiscal year 2019, as well as through fiscal year 2020 in terms of meeting our demand expectations, as well as remaining cost competitive.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks for that. And then I guess just related to that maybe Dave, can you maybe break down CapEx sort of how much is building versus equipment, it sounds like there is roughly 2 billion that was buildings this year in fiscal 2019. Is the cut next year going to be almost all in infrastructure so that WFE is kind of flat to down smidge, year-over-year? Is that kind of how to think about it? Thanks.
Dave Zinsner: So, getting back to the FY 2019 just to be clear, what Sanjay said was about $2 billion was kind of construction related spend, the rest is front-end and back-end. So, there is some – and some miscellaneous capital spend for R&D group and so forth. So, there is more to it than even that. I'll be honest with you, we have not, you kind of completely finalized CapEx budget for next year. We have a pretty good sense of directionally where it is going, but all the pieces specifically were not quite there yet. And so, what we'd like to do is wait and give you more granularity around that in the next quarter's call. But I would anticipate that both areas would have some reduction to them.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay, awesome. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Your line is open.
Blayne Curtis: Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. Sort of follow up on the Huawei point. Just want to make sure I understood what you're saying. Are you able to ship because the IP resides in another country? Just trying to understand how exactly are you able to continue to ship? And then just kind of curious as you look out, I'm sure there's going to be some components that go into these phones from other vendors that don't have an ability to ship, so I'm kind of just curious your thoughts on kind of downstream impacts and whether you've encapsulated all that?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, with respect to what we are able to ship to Huawei, as I said before that what we are able to ship is what is not under the export administration regulations. And that's what we are able to ship and actually export administration regulations have various complex aspects and considerations several criteria that you have to go through, if you're interested in that, you can certainly go to the BIS site and look for those and we assess our products versus those and you know these considerations are not just limited to any one or two aspects such as what you mentioned, I mean they have several aspects and we assess our products that we can ship to Huawei versus those and have made determination or shipments and we, as we said, we began those shipments in last two weeks. With respect to your question around other components etcetera, of course this is a company by company decision and each company has to evaluate its own situation and obviously Huawei has to look at its own supply chain. So, with respect to the products that we can ship to them, we work closely with them to understand what is their latest demand on those products, and that is what is baked into our FQ4 guidance. What I would like to point out here is that at the end of the day since you asked the question about mobile phones. The smartphone demand overall from consumers point of view is really going to be the same. I mean, consumers are going to be buying the phones that they're going to buy, based on the features, the new models, all of that will be bought there may be some share shift that maybe occurring between the various suppliers of smartphones and as you know, we are well engaged with customers across the smartphone ecosystem as a supplier to them. Of course, you know Huawei was our number one customer, we continue to engage with other customers as well. And we have had growing presence with those other customers and we'll continue to look for opportunities to best optimize our business while always of course continuing to comply with US laws and regulations and for that matter we always comply with laws and regulations in all countries that we operate in.
Blayne Curtis: Thanks. And then I just wanted to ask you on the cloud data center, obviously an important segment and you did have some encouraging comments, just kind of curious on that pace of recovery maybe versus what you had thought a quarter ago, just kind of the health of the channel and the pace of recovery there. Thanks.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Pace of recovery …
Dave Zinsner: In cloud and data center.
Sanjay Mehrotra: For cloud and data center. I mean, as we said I think cloud customers, as well as several other customers had operated with high levels of inventory in the – starting late last year and through the course of first half of this year those inventory levels have been largely worked to normal levels. Except for in enterprise, as we noted in our prepared remarks and we look forward to robust growth in fiscal fourth quarter in the area of cloud and you know we are, of course, continuing to broaden our product portfolio as well with solutions such as NVMe solutions and that will bring us bigger opportunities in the future as well.
Blayne Curtis: Okay.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-03-20 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Lateef, and I'll be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Micron’s Second Quarter 2019 Financial Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Farhan Ahmad, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.
Farhan Ahmad: Thank you. And welcome to Micron Technology's second fiscal quarter 2019 financial conference call. On the call with me today are Sanjay Mehrotra, President and CEO; and Dave Zinsner, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will be approximately 60 minutes in length. This call including the audio and slides, is also being webcast from our Investor Relations website at investors.micron.com. In addition, our website contains the earnings press release filed a short while ago. Today's discussion of financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures may be found on our website along with convertible debt and capped call dilution table. As a reminder, the prepared remarks from this call and webcast replay will be available on our website later today. We encourage you to monitor our website at micron.com throughout the quarter for the most current information on the Company, including information on various financial conferences that we will be attending.

Although, we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after today's date to conform these statements to actual results. I'll now turn the call over to Sanjay.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Farhan. Good afternoon, everyone. Micron executed well in the second quarter, delivering solid results and healthy levels of profitability and free cash flow, despite a challenging industry environment. We continued to strengthen our balance sheet in the quarter by increasing our cash position and total liquidity. Although we expect industry headwinds in the near-term, we continue to grow and diversify our product portfolio, improve our cost competitiveness and lay the foundation to emerge stronger, both financially and operationally, from this environment. I would like to start with a review of two important pillars of Micron’s strategy, improving cost competitiveness and increasing high-value solutions in our portfolio. Our strategy positions us for the tremendous opportunities ahead, while also enabling us to better navigate near-term headwinds. Strong execution against this strategy has improved our annualized profitability by over $6 billion from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2018. This has improved our EBITDA margin by more than 15 percentage points relative to our competitors over the same period. We expect further progress on cost reduction this fiscal year, including healthy year-over-year cost declines in both DRAM and NAND. In DRAM, our 1Y nanometer is yielding well, and we expect to increase conversion to 1Y nanometer in the second half of fiscal 2019. We are also making excellent progress on 1Z nanometer and have started sampling products utilizing this technology. As we have said in the past, future DRAM node transitions require additional process steps and more fab cleanroom space. Consequently, in addition to the previously announced expansion of our Hiroshima facility, we are starting site preparation for the cleanroom expansion at our Taichung facility to enable the transition of existing DRAM wafer capacity to future nodes. We are still finalizing the timing but expect production output sometime in calendar 2021. In NAND, we achieved meaningful production on 96-layer 3D NAND in fiscal Q2 with the fastest yield ramp of any NAND product in our history. We are also making good progress on development of our fourth-generation 3D NAND, which uses our replacement gate technology. Given the high initial capital requirements of floating gate to replacement gate conversion, we expect that our first replacement gate node will provide limited cost reduction, and hence we are planning to deploy this node across select NAND products, with the rest of the portfolio converting later to the second node of replacement gate. This approach will optimize the ROI of our NAND capital investments as we convert our capacity. As a reminder, our replacement gate architecture will allow us to deliver performance improvements and provide us an efficient path toward scaling multiple future generations of 3D NAND. Given the limited initial deployment at the first node of replacement gate, we expect that our NAND bit supply growth in calendar 2020 will be below industry demand levels, and we plan to utilize our cost-effective floating gate inventory position to meet customer requirements. Turning to high-value solutions, more than two-thirds of NAND revenues in the first half of fiscal 2019 were from high-value solutions, up from 55% in the first half of 2018. This increased mix of high-value solutions, combined with our competitive cost structure, enabled us to deliver fiscal Q2 NAND gross margin in the high 30s despite steep price declines in the industry. In SSDs, we are making progress on transitioning to NVMe while continuing to improve our cost profile in SATA. In fiscal Q2, we began revenue shipments to a large PC OEM for our first NVMe client SSD, which features our internally designed controller, and are in active qualifications with other customers. We intend to introduce cloud and enterprise NVMe SSDs later this calendar year. In SATA, we introduced consumer and client SSDs based on 96-layer 3D NAND in fiscal Q2. In the cloud market, our custom persistent memory solution, which combines DRAM and NAND, is now fully ramped and contributed meaningfully to our cloud revenues. 3D XPoint development remains on track with customer samples planned before calendar year-end. We believe 3D XPoint technology will be a key enabler for numerous new applications, particularly artificial intelligence and data analytics. As announced previously, in January of this year we exercised our option to acquire Intel’s interest in the IMFT facility in Lehi, Utah. This acquisition provides us with the manufacturing capability and highly skilled talent to drive 3D XPoint development and innovation. Now turning to end markets. I’ll start with mobile. During fiscal Q2 we grew revenues and expanded gross margins year-over-year despite adverse memory and storage pricing and weakness in high-end smartphone unit sales. Our performance in mobile was propelled by growth in our managed NAND portfolio, where NAND bit shipments grew more than 5x year-over-year. We are also seeing strong demand for our 1Y-nanometer LPDRAM due to its industry-leading capacity and best-in-class power consumption. Memory and storage content growth in smartphones continues, driven by features such as multiple cameras, machine learning, computational photography and 4K video. Last month, Samsung announced its premium Galaxy S10 Plus smartphone, featuring 12 gigabytes of DRAM and 1 terabyte of NAND. At Mobile World Congress, several companies announced exciting new phones featuring 5G connectivity and foldable screens. These next-generation premium smartphones will typically feature 8 to 12 gigabytes of DRAM and 256 to 512 gigabytes of NAND versus 4 to 6 gigabytes of DRAM and 64 to 128 gigabytes of NAND in current-generation premium smartphones. These trends will likely cascade to lower-tier phones as well. We believe that 5G, foldable phones and upcoming innovations in augmented and virtual reality will drive sustained content growth for years to come and should reignite smartphone unit sales beginning in calendar 2020. We are also excited by the opportunity that 5G is likely to create beyond mobile, as it will enable true machine-to-machine communication and accelerate data creation and analysis, which are fundamental drivers for our business. We expect 5G adoption to create increased demand for memory and storage in IoT devices, wireless infrastructure and data centers. Our embedded and networking businesses are already starting to see benefit from early 5G infrastructure investments. In the data center market, the demand for memory has moderated this year following exceptional growth in the last two years. The slowdown in demand is a result of ongoing customer inventory adjustments, as well as software optimizations at some cloud customers. We expect growth to resume in the second half of calendar 2019 as we see improvement in our customers’ inventory position. The new server processors that support higher memory densities are expected to be introduced in a few months, which should drive additional demand growth in the second half of calendar 2019. In fiscal Q2, we shipped high-density 1Y-nanometer DDR4 server module samples to customers ahead of plan, which will position us well to benefit from this new CPU platform ramp. In graphics, we grew sales of our high-performance GDDR6 DRAM and expanded our customer base, which positions us for stronger growth in the second half of calendar 2019. We are seeing steep customer inventory adjustments in GDDR5 and expect them to be largely completed by the middle of this calendar year. We had another strong quarter in automotive with year-over-year revenue growth driven by increasing demand for ADAS and advanced in-vehicle infotainment systems. In fiscal Q2, we announced several new automotive products, including a collaboration with Qualcomm for next-gen in-vehicle infotainment and 5G communications modules. We also announced a new strategic collaboration with a leading supplier of ADAS platforms using our full portfolio of memory and storage products. Lackluster automobile unit sales are a short-term challenge, however, we see the auto market generating robust growth for Micron over the next decade, as memory and storage content continues to increase in autos, driven by advanced infotainment systems and the adoption of autonomous vehicles. In the industrial and consumer markets, we saw a decline in sales due to seasonal, macroeconomic and pricing weaknesses, as well as inventory adjustments. We had important design wins in video surveillance, point of sales and factory automation applications. At Mobile World Congress, we announced the industry’s first 1 terabyte microSD card using QLC NAND. In the PC market, sales declined more than 25% sequentially driven by weaker pricing and the inventory drawdown seen in other segments, as well as client CPU shortages. We remain focused on our cost competitiveness in this market, and over two-thirds of our PC DRAM bit shipments are now coming from our advanced 1X and 1Y-nanometer technology nodes. Now turning to our DRAM industry outlook. Since our last earnings call, DRAM pricing weakened more than expected. Our demand outlook for calendar 2019 has moderated, led by somewhat greater levels of customer inventory, weakening server demand at several enterprise OEM customers and worse-than-expected CPU shortages. We believe macroeconomic uncertainty is also contributing to hesitation in buying behavior at some customers. However, as we discussed on our last earnings call, we still expect DRAM bit shipments to begin increasing in our fiscal Q3, with demand growth strengthening in the second half of calendar 2019 as most customer inventories are likely to normalize by mid-year. Based on our current view, we now estimate calendar 2019 DRAM bit demand growth from our customers to be in the low-to-mid teens, with their end demand a few points above that. Further, we estimate industry supply bit growth is tracking to mid-to-high teens. Given the lower DRAM demand outlook from our customers, we have decided to idle approximately 5% of our DRAM wafer starts. This action will bring our production levels close to our view of DRAM industry bit demand growth for calendar 2019. We will continue to monitor the market and take appropriate actions to ensure that our bit supply growth in calendar 2019 remains closely aligned with demand. Looking beyond our fiscal 2019, we expect bit demand growth to accelerate as mobile and server demand improves. In particular, we expect robust DRAM bit demand growth in fiscal 2020, bouncing back from a weak fiscal 2019. NAND markets remain oversupplied from the acceleration in bit growth driven by the industry transition to 64-layer 3D NAND. Although fiscal Q2 pricing came in below our expectations, we are optimistic that demand elasticity and seasonal trends will support improving demand growth in the second half of the calendar year. We expect that calendar 2019 NAND bit demand growth is likely to be in the mid-30s% range, with industry supply growing in the high-30s, and we are targeting our bit shipments to grow close to the growth rate of industry bit demand. We have been managing our NAND bit supply growth prudently, including adjusting our capital planning and wafer volumes. We are reducing our total NAND wafer starts by approximately 5%, mostly through reductions on our legacy nodes. Given these changes in DRAM and NAND industry conditions, we have reduced our CapEx for fiscal 2019 and are evaluating our CapEx for fiscal 2020. We are taking prudent actions to address the current market conditions, while executing well on our long-term strategic objectives. I will now turn it over to Dave to provide financial results of our fiscal second quarter and guidance for the third quarter. 
Dave Zinsner: Thanks, Sanjay. Micron’s fiscal second quarter results were within our guidance as we executed well in a period of somewhat weaker-than-expected market conditions. In the quarter, we returned capital to shareholders, continued to improve our cost structure and strengthened our balance sheet through our first issuance of investment-grade debt. Most of the proceeds from this offering were used to redeem a large portion of our outstanding convertible notes, reducing our fully diluted share count. Total fiscal second quarter revenue was $5.8 billion, down 21% from the prior year and down 26% from the fiscal first quarter. Revenue reflected worse-than-expected pricing trends in DRAM and NAND. DRAM revenue was down 28% year-over-year and 30% sequentially from the fiscal first quarter and represented 64% of total Company revenue in the fiscal Q2. DRAM ASPs declined in the low 20% range compared to the prior quarter, while shipment quantities were down in the low double-digits. Year-over-year, DRAM bit shipments were down mid-single digits. NAND revenue declined 2% year-over-year and 18% from the prior quarter. NAND revenue represented 30% of total Company revenue in the fiscal Q2. Our overall NAND ASP declined in the mid-20% range, while shipment quantities increased in the upper single-digit percent range compared to the prior quarter. NAND bit shipments came in stronger than our expectation due to timing of demand from a large customer. Now turning to our revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the Compute And Networking Business Unit was $2.4 billion, down 35% year-over-year and 34% from the prior quarter. The sequential decline was driven by pricing across major market segments, as well as volume reductions, particularly in graphics, cloud and PCs. Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit or MBU was $1.6 billion, up 3% year-over-year and down 27% from the record fiscal first quarter. Lower volume due to weak seasonality and pricing contributed to the quarter-over-quarter revenue decline. Despite the current market conditions, MBU revenue grew year-over-year due to strong growth in our managed NAND products. The Embedded Business Unit revenue of $800 million was down 4% compared to the prior year and down 14% from the record fiscal first quarter. The automotive business was only down slightly from record fiscal first quarter, despite weakness in automobile sales. Other embedded revenue declined quarter-over-quarter due to weaker pricing and lower DRAM volumes. Finally, the Storage Business Unit fiscal second quarter revenue was $1 billion, down 19% year-over-year and down 11% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential decline was driven by lower SSD revenue, partially offset by increased component revenue. The consolidated gross margin for the fiscal second quarter was 50% compared to 58% in the prior year and 59% in the fiscal first quarter. Fiscal second quarter results included ongoing impact from 3D XPoint underutilization costs, which approximated 160 basis points. Pricing came in weaker than expected in both DRAM and NAND, but strong execution on cost reductions resulted in gross margins within our guidance range. Fiscal second quarter operating expenses of $818 million came in at the high end of our guided range. OpEx included $37 million in one-time tool impairment costs that were not anticipated in our guidance. Excluding this impairment, OpEx would have come in at the low end of our guidance. We remain focused on controlling our expenses, while investing in future products and technologies. We delivered solid profitability in the fiscal second quarter with operating income of $2.1 billion, representing 36% of revenue. This margin is down 13 percentage points year-over-year and also down 13 percentage points from the fiscal first quarter. The tax rate for the fiscal second quarter was approximately 8.3%. And we now expect our fiscal 2019 tax rate to be approximately 10.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share in the fiscal Q2 were $1.71, down from $2.82 in the year-ago quarter and down from $2.97 in the prior quarter. Turning to cash flows and capital spending. In the fiscal second quarter, we generated $3.4 billion in cash from operations, representing 59% of revenue. Capital spending, net of third-party contributions, was approximately $2.4 billion, relatively flat compared with the prior quarter. We have lowered our CapEx target for fiscal 2019 to approximately $9 billion from our prior guidance range of $9 billion to $9.5 billion, as we manage through the current environment while maintaining investment in our strategic priorities. As we mentioned before, a significant portion of our CapEx this year is going towards cleanroom construction and assembly and test operations, which do not contribute to our bit supply growth. Fab equipment spend in fiscal 2019 is down from last year and is mostly targeted towards migrating 20-nanometer DRAM and 32-layer 3D NAND to more advanced nodes, with no new wafer capacity additions. The investment in these technology transitions provides compelling cost reduction and a very attractive ROI. As we have demonstrated over the past two quarters, we remain nimble on CapEx based on business conditions. In the fiscal second quarter, our adjusted free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less net CapEx was approximately $1 billion, compared to $2.2 billion in the year-ago quarter and $2.3 billion in the fiscal first quarter. We deployed approximately 70% of the quarter’s free cash flow towards our share repurchase program. We bought back approximately $700 million of stock in fiscal Q2, representing 21 million shares. Through the first half of fiscal 2019, we repurchased 63 million shares for $2.5 billion, utilizing 76% of our free cash flow in fiscal first half. We continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of capital and remain committed to deploying at least 50% of our free cash flow on an annual basis towards repurchases under our current $10 billion authorization. In addition to the buybacks, we also eliminated our 2043 converts subsequent to the quarter close, which at current share prices effectively lowered our fully diluted share count by approximately 9 million shares. Note that the underlying share count for these converts was 35 million shares, which could have resulted in greater dilution with increases in our share price. Inventory ended the quarter at $4.4 billion, increasing from $3.9 billion at the end of the fiscal first quarter. Our fiscal second quarter days of inventory were 134 days compared to 107 days in the fiscal first quarter. The actions that we have announced today regarding supply reductions, combined with improving customer demand, will begin to address our higher inventory levels. We ended the fiscal Q2 in a strong liquidity position with net cash of $3 billion and total liquidity of nearly $12 billion. Total cash increased to $9.2 billion, largely as a result of our $1.8 billion debt issuance. Our debt position increased by $2.1 billion to $6.2 billion in the quarter, primarily due to the debt offering and recognition of premium associated with the Series G convertible note redemption. Subsequent to quarter-end, we used $1.4 billion of cash to complete the convertible note redemption, which reduced our outstanding GAAP debt balance by approximately $1.1 billion. On January 14th, we exercised our call option to acquire IMFT, our joint venture with Intel. We expect to close the transaction in either late fiscal 2019 or in the first half of fiscal 2020. This near $1.5 billion transaction will also retire the $1 billion of joint-venture-related debt on Micron’s balance sheet. Since we already consolidate IMFT’s results in our financial statements, we do not expect a material impact to our near-term results. Now, turning to our market outlook. DRAM and NAND markets are working through supply and demand imbalances. Our visibility remains low and the near-term environment remains challenging. While there have been CapEx reductions across the industry, they haven’t yet impacted output growth due to lead times. We expect our DRAM bit shipments to grow sequentially during the fiscal third quarter and at much higher rates in the fiscal fourth quarter. In NAND, we expect a modest sequential decline in our bit shipments in the fiscal third quarter due to timing of shipments and expect growth to resume in the fiscal fourth quarter. The output reductions that we announced today for DRAM and NAND, plus the $1.5 billion of CapEx reductions that we have announced year-to-date, will also help reduce our supply of DRAM and NAND in the second half of this calendar year. With that in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for the fiscal third quarter is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.80 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in the range of 37% to 40%; and operating expenses at approximately $785 million, plus or minus $25 million. Based on a share count of approximately 1.14 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $0.85, plus or minus $0.10. In closing, Micron continues to execute on our key initiatives, increasing our mix of high-value solutions, improving our cost profile and investing in new and innovative products. Our solid financial footing, strong liquidity and substantially reduced leverage means that we are well-positioned to invest in our future despite near-term market conditions. I’ll now turn the call over to Sanjay for some concluding remarks.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Dave. In response to near-term industry conditions, we are taking decisive action to reduce our supply growth to be consistent with industry demand. At the same time, we continue to invest and execute against our strategic priorities to reduce costs and increase the mix of high-value solutions in our portfolio. The long-term demand trends for Micron remain very healthy, with tremendous growth opportunities across multiple markets. We continue to believe that the memory industry is structurally stronger with more diversified demand drivers and moderating supply growth capability. With our strong balance sheet and improved product portfolio and operating model, Micron is better positioned than ever before to win and deliver long-term value for shareholders. We will now open for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava of BMO. Your line is open.
Ambrish Srivastava: Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to focus on the inventory situation. Sanjay, you talked about hyperscale inventory a couple of times, and then Dave tying up also trying to see what the balance sheet inventory would do. So, A, just update on where are we on the -- in terms of weeks of inventory? And then, for my quick follow-up, Dave, what's the flex CapEx now left that you could moderate down if the conditions were to get worse? Thank you.
Dave Zinsner: Okay. So, I'll take -- first, let me talk about our inventory. So, as we noted, our inventories are now at 134 days, a couple of dynamics going on. So, in DRAM, as we talked about last quarter, we expected to carry a higher level of inventory in the first half of the calendar year as our customers that have built up inventory and start to digest through that. And then, on top of that, what we did was we reduced our CapEx. And so, the outcome of that reduction in CapEx should start to have an effect in the back of our half of our calendar year in terms of bit growth, so that will start to help manage inventory as well. And then on top of that, this quarter, we talked about further reductions in CapEx down to the approximately $9 billion. And we talked about taking some underutilization, about 5% of underutilization to kind of further reduce the output. So, that should help bring DRAM inventories back more in line. So, we would expect that back half of the calendar year we start to see DRAM be in a better place. On the NAND front, obviously, we're at elevated levels of inventory as well. Now, that is somewhat by design, as Sanjay noted in his remarks, we do have the transition from floating gate to replacement gate in NAND going on in calendar 2020. And so, the bit output is not going to be very robust. And so, the idea was to carry higher levels of inventory into 2020 such that that would help support the end, the demand from our customers. Having said that, we also -- part of the CapEx reduction does impact NAND as well. And also, we did adjust our wafer output by 5% and NAND as well as also try to manage inventory. So, I think that, inventory you'll start to see improve in the back half of the calendar year, and then into 2020, as we start to work through the NAND portion of the inventory. As far as CapEx goes, really the way we're managing this is what we said, when we talked about it at the Analysts Day. We're committed to our model of low-30s as a percent of sales for CapEx. Obviously, there'll be years where that is above the average and there will be years that that will be below the average. I think, the last two years, fiscal 2017 and 2018, we were below that low-30s model. So, it's not surprising to be a bit above that low-30s level for these couple years. Plus, on top of that, we had a bit of pent-up demand to get some of the clean room space staged to be able to manage these node transitions. And so we have a number of different cleanroom buildout initiatives going on this year, which is maybe elevating a little bit from kind of our normal run rate. But, over the long term, you would see us be in this low-30s percent level. And as I think Sanjay mentioned in his remarks, I think I mentioned in my remarks, we're flexible on CapEx, we’ll modulate it based on the economic circumstances.
Ambrish Srivastava: And the hyperscale?
Sanjay Mehrotra: With respect to hyperscale, as I said in my remarks that we do expect that inventory will work through the system at our customers during the first half of the year. And we certainly are seeing evidence of inventory consumption by our customers. And we do expect that that will largely be completed by mid this year. And we do expect in DRAM that growth will accelerate, both sequentially and year-over-year for the rest of the calendar year. And second half of the calendar year, with respect to demand improvement, there will be -- the demand will improve in the second half of the calendar year compared to the first half of the calendar year. And, of course, effect of CPU shortages, those will continue to improve in situation over the course of the year. And we expect that also to contribute toward improvement in demand in the second half of the calendar year compared to first year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Pitzer: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Sanjay, I guess, I just wanted a little bit more detail behind the decision to actually shutter some DRAM capacity in the current quarter. Last quarter, you talked about how a flattening cost curve actually increased the useful life of holding inventory, which seemed to make sense to me. This seems to be a little bit of a reversion from that. And just given that you're not a big enough piece of the DRAM market to I think impact overall supply-demand, it really kind of depends upon what the guys in Korea are doing. I'm just kind of curious as to why you came to this decision to shutter some capacity.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, I think, as Dave had previously mentioned in one of the earning calls, that about 150 days of inventory is something that we are comfortable with. And when we really look at our demand at this time and look at our production output, we think it is important for us to bring our supply to be in line with the expected demand for the year. And it provides us obvious benefits in terms of managing our inventories more effectively, managing our cash flow effectively as well and really managing our business in a healthy fashion. Of course, our inventory is at good cost, there is no obsolescence issue with this inventory at all. But, we really consider it prudent management of our business to bring our supply growth in line with our demand expectations.
Dave Zinsner: And I’d just add -- the underutilization costs that will incur are not going to help layer into our cost per unit. So, they will be taken as period costs within the quarter and it's implied in our 37% to 40% gross margin guidance for the third fiscal quarter. Sorry to interrupt, John.
John Pitzer: So, Sanjay, you explained why in fiscal 2020 you’ll under grow the industry in NAND bits as you move to fourth generation. I'm wondering if you could help us understand what the cost implication of that is. Will your cost curve in NAND be negatively impacted or should you be able to benefit in 2020 from continued mix towards 96-layer on the technology side and just product mix to more managed NAND? How do we think about cost in fiscal year 2020?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Our cost position will be good in fiscal year 2020 because today with our both 64-layer as well as 96-layer technologies, we absolutely have been outperforming the industry in terms of our at the die level the costs on a per gigabyte basis. And that -- and obviously, as you know, we have discussed this many times in the past, those benefits come from CMOS under array architecture which Micron has pioneered and we currently are in our third generation using that. So that gives us a very significant cost advantage and that will carry over well, giving us competitive mix of NAND production in 2020 in our fiscal year 2020 to meet the market demands. And keep in mind, the fourth generation of our 3D NAND which will be the first node in replacement gate technology, even with greater number of layers will actually have greater capital intensity associated with it because of transition from floating gate to replacement gate that requires more tools, more specific unique tools to implement replacement gate. And that's why we are really converting portion of our portfolio to that first generation replacement gate technology. And remainder of the portfolio will convert from the third generation floating gate to the second node of replacement gate later on. And obviously that will provide us a bigger benefit when we do that. The second node of replacement gate with yet higher layers later compared to the first node. So, that will give us a benefit of cost as well as ROI and it will really be the best way to manage this transition for us. So, in summary, even with increasing the number of layers in the third -- first generation of replacement gate, we feel very good about the cost competitiveness with the mix of floating gate and replacement gate technologies that we will be achieving next year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Evercore. Your question please?
C.J. Muse: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, a two-part question. You used the word idling regarding 5% for DRAM and then reducing your NAND, wafer starts by 5%. I guess, two questions to that. Are you trying to send us a different signal in terms of what you're doing for both? And then, could you provide a little clarity on how we should think about the impact to your cost structure, as you slow down wafers? And then, when you start to turn back on, how we should think about the impact? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, bottom-line is we are reducing our output of DRAM and NAND. In DRAM, the reduction in supply growth, as a result of this idling capacity, idling wafer starts, is bigger impact. And in NAND, as we reduce our wafer starts, particularly related to the legacy nodes, the impact on the supply bit growth is smaller because that wafer start reduction that you mentioned is primarily targeted toward legacy nodes. So, again, the objective of these is to bring down our supply growth toward our estimations of demand, both in DRAM and NAND from the point of view of 2019 as well as 2020 timeframe. And with respect to cost, as I said before, we have continued to outperform in terms of cost reduction -- year-over-year cost reduction capability in DRAM. And we feel very good about our ability to manage with this slowdown in DRAM, managing a competitive fashion with our cost over the course of next few quarters. And in NAND, I just commented on our cost position there. And I'll just add to the previous comments on the cost position that of course next year, we will also continue to get the benefit of our 96-layer transition from 64-layer to 96-layer, the ongoing transition during the course of next year, which will also be helping us with cost. So, I believe our cost in DRAM as well as NAND will be competitive. And I just want to point out that the benefits of deduction, output deduction go beyond just aspects of cost. They of course -- those benefits include inventory management and cash flow management.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Harlan Sur: Great. Thank you for letting me ask the question here. So, back to a question on inventory. So, when you first started seeing your customer demand inventory related weakness, it always takes time for the actual supply growth output of your manufacturing infrastructure to kind of trend towards your target. So, initially, you augment that manufacturing ramp down with some inventory accumulation. It appears that you executed to that in fiscal Q2. But, now that you're moderating output lower again, again, that's going to appear that it's going to take some more time. So, do you anticipate inventories actually moving higher here in the May quarter, before it starts to down shift in the back half of the calendar year?
Dave Zinsner: Yes. I think, inventory might be a little bit elevated in the May quarter relative to where we are today. Obviously, as you point out, it does take some time, most of the CapEx reductions we took him took in the first fiscal quarter. So, those take a couple of quarters, but we should start experiencing that in the back half of the calendar year. And the underutilization, you get probably a quarter before it starts impacting you. So, I think, we’ll be in pretty good shape on DRAM, as I said, as we kind of exit the calendar year. NAND will take a little bit longer because of the reasons we cited about keeping elevated levels of inventory into 2020.
Harlan Sur: Great. And then, my follow-up question, much of -- Sanjay, much of your industry outlook is based off of a view of second half improvements in virtually all of your target markets, PC, client cloud, mobile, et cetera. Given the value chain and lead time, should we anticipate that your customer second half recovery should start to drive an inflection in your NAND and DRAM business in fiscal Q4?
Sanjay Mehrotra: We are not providing fiscal Q4 guidance here. But, as we have said that second half of this calendar year, we do expect that bit growth in DRAM to continue on a quarter-over-quarter basis, both sequentially as well as on a year-over-year basis. And that is already, we are guiding to bit growth in DRAM for our FQ3, and that should continue in FQ4 and for the rest of the year as well. And in NAND, there is of course the seasonality in the second half of the calendar year. And of course, we expect effect of elasticity also to help improve the demand. And the trend of increasing average capacities in smartphones both for DRAM and NAND continues to be intact. When you look at the results that some of the cloud service providers have reported, those results continue to be solid, pointing to the demand and the growth in cloud services. And of course, memory and storage is an essential part of all the computing paradigms of the future that are increasingly being based on AI and ML as well. All of that bodes well for the long-term demand trends as well. But, yes, I mean, we do -- in all of our end markets, we do see a generally improvement in demand in the second half versus the first half. And of course, all of this is barring macroeconomic uncertainty. In case that there is any further determination in microeconomic climate, then we can have different impact in this outlook. But, that's what -- based on what we know today, that's our assessment of demand expectations.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri of UBS. Your line is open. 
Timothy Arcuri: Sanjay, I wanted to go back just to question that got asked before. So, in DRAM, you are still well above cash costs, yet you're idling capacity. So, obviously demand is a lot worse than you expected. But, you sound pretty optimistic that it's going to come back in the back half of the year. So, why would you reduce starts now if you’re so optimistic about demand coming back in the back half of the year? I get that it has to do with inventory. But, I'm just trying to reconcile those two comments, because it seems like you're leaving money on the table. Thanks.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, demand has been weak so far this year and we expect demand environment to be weak in the first half as well. So, when we talk about our total DRAM demand growth expectations, we are talking about the full year basis, right? So, we need to be -- and when you look at our supply growth, of course, we are looking at that too, on a full year basis. So, we want to bring our supply in line with our demands expectations, and we believe that this improving demand environment second half versus first half that I referred to earlier, we will be able to capture the benefit of that with our supply cutback that we have mentioned and also help bring our all time continue to drive improvement in our inventory position as well.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay. And then, just a quick follow-up, Dave. I just wanted to go back to the question on costs. You've been bringing DRAM costs down kind of like low to mid-teens year-over-year and NAND has been kind of in the mid-20s year-over-year. So, it seems like some of these actions have to ultimately impact your abilities of cost down vis-à-vis that level? Is -- am I missing something there, because it sounds like you're saying that there's no impact? So, can you just again reconcile those for me? Thanks.
Dave Zinsner: We do expect healthy cost declines in both DRAM and NAND this year. We are still making technology transitions next year. And so, we would obviously expect, particularly in DRAN the cost will be good. As we said, replacement gate might not be where we want it to be in the very first generation. But one of the advantages of carrying the inventory we're carrying, 64-layer and 96-layer inventory in the next year is that has a very good cost structure. And so, we should have a good cost structure in 2020 on NAND as well. The other thing on utilization, I just want to make sure it's clear. What period cost means is, we'll take that expense kind of as it comes in the in the quarters in which we take the underutilization. It won't roll up in the inventory; it won't be counted as part of the cost. So, obviously, we'll have an impact on margins. And as I said, it's implied in the guidance of the margins we gave for the fiscal third quarter.
Sanjay Mehrotra: And on NAND, I just wanted to point out again that, 96-layer is still early in our production ramp, and it will continue to ramp during the course of next year as we bring out our first node of replacement gate. So, 96-layer will also continue to be a strong driver of our cost reduction capability in 2020.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
Karl Ackerman: Hi. Good afternoon. I wanted to just kind of go back to bit growth. I understand that idling your wafer starts slows your bit supply. But, do you expect any shifts in your portfolio mix toward certain end markets or shifts toward new technology nodes that should impact your second half bit supply?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, obviously, we pay a lot of attention to this in terms of managing the mix of our production. We do that on an ongoing basis anyhow in production. And, when we implement this output cut, both in NAND as well as DRAM, obviously we make sure that we are not impacting any aspect of our ability to fulfill our demand. So, as we said, I mean, we have high levels of inventory currently, both in NAND and DRAM. And it gives us an opportunity to bring our production to be in line with demand. And when we say that we mean that we will be able to address the demand in all of our end markets. We are not going to compromise our production cuts so that we run low in terms of meeting our customers' requirements in any of the end market segments. So, we believe this is a very prudent way for us to manage our business.
Karl Ackerman: I appreciate that. I guess, perhaps a clarification on that question, then. The [indiscernible] would say that NAND demand elasticity has not yet kicked in. So, could you just perhaps shed some light on design wins, maybe not just in NAND but also in DRAM that you've seen across your product portfolio that would anchor your view of a second half recovery? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: With respect to NAND elasticity, I mean, certainly the average capacities in notebook, PCs, as well as the attach rates of SSDs to notebooks, does continue to go up. So, that is of course a price elastic market as well. And the price -- attractive price points of NAND, of course provide benefits of greater HDD replacement both in the data center market as well as in the client market. Mobile definitely continues to be pointing to elasticity with respect to NAND. At Mobile World Congress, you saw smartphones, foldable phones and 5G phones being announced with 512-gigabyte and terabyte of storage capacities in them. And again, applications are also advancing toward features that require more and more storage, for example, 5G with greater connectivity as well as low latency will of course, these driving applications that you need more, DRAM as well as more NAND. So applications -- end market applications continue to do very well, And Micron itself with respect to our product portfolio, we are very much focused on continuing to expand our product offerings and we have also -- on the SSD side, we are expanding our portfolio with NVMe solutions. We have just brought our first NVMe client drive into the market; and later this year, we will have NVMe for enterprise and cloud applications as well. So, this is -- and we announced that we got a qualification win and just begun shipment to a customer with our NVMe -- first generation NVMe client side as well. So, these are all the things that we are absolutely focused on in terms of our roadmap to expanding our opportunities. And of course, we have made lot of improvement with respect to some of these solutions over the course of last couple of years. And there is a lot of execution that is remaining ahead of us with respect to expanding our SSD opportunities, for example, as well as growing our mobile opportunities on the NAND side where we have gained meaningful share over the course of last few quarters. But, there is a lot more opportunity and a lot more roadmap execution that is required for us here.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Your line is open.
Blayne Curtis: Hey, guys. Thanks for my taking question. I was curious on the customer timing if you can elaborate. Was that just the timing between quarters or was that more of a strategic by that was multi-quarters in nature? And then, I was just curious if you can elaborate on the data center you set back in the second half, but it seems like you're not seeing a pickup in orders yet, and kind of what gives you confidence that you're going to see that start in Q3?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, with respect to timing of demand in the second quarter that was -- as you mentioned, it was a large customers timing of specific fulfillment of their demand. And that's what -- and that was related to NAND. And with respect to the second part of your question, as I said before, that we do see evidence of inventory consumption by our customers and that gives us confidence that this inventory will largely work itself through the system in the first half with improvements in demand in the second half. And, we have also certainly in recent weeks seen some new orders from certain customers that previously had high inventories. Of course, too soon to use this as any kind of a slope in terms of demand buildup from here on. But, bottom-line is that ultimately the end market demand drivers continue to be strong. If the consumption of DRAM by our customers in the end markets, particularly cloud market continues to be healthy, it’s just that those customers are using up their inventory to meet that demand. And over the course of next few months, by mid this year, that inventory will be returning to normalized levels to a large extent, and then that will provide for opportunities for a greater demand in the second half of the year compared to the first half.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your question, please?
Joe Moore: Great, thank you. I'm just curious on the inventory side for the May quarter [technical difficulty]. To the extent that you built 27 days of inventory this last quarter, a fair amount of your introduction went on to the balance sheet. [Technical difficulty]. Thanks. 
Dave Zinsner: We’ve got a little -- most of that, but okay, let take a crack at that, Joe. There was some background noise. So, yes, as you cite, inventories were up. We do expect DRAM to grow sequentially in the third fiscal quarter. That combined with -- are starting to see some benefit. [Technical difficulty] Those should be a combination of the reduction in utilization and the CapEx activities, or CapEx reductions that we've already put in place, will start to adjust a bit output grow. So, we’d start to see some benefit from that in the fiscal third quarter. As I said, we do expect inventories to be up again next quarter. But then, as Sanjay cited, a lot of the customers that have built up inventory will start to be back to normal. And they'll start to place heavier orders on us again, in the third and fourth calendar year, we'll start to see these reductions in a DRAM inventory levels.
Operator: And that does conclude the Q&A session and this call. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for your participation. Have a wonderful day. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Farhan. Good afternoon everyone. In the first quarter, we demonstrated solid execution, further improved our balance sheet, and began executing on our $10 billion share buyback program. We delivered strong profitability despite revenue headwinds from the inventory adjustments at several customers, and industry-wide CPU shortages. Our results also reflect our success in further diversifying our business as evidenced by record sales in our mobile, automotive, and industrial businesses in the quarter. As we enter calendar 2019, we are seeing weakening demand from our customers. As a result, we are taking decisive actions, including a meaningful reduction in our fiscal 2019 CapEx plan, in both DRAM and NAND that will materially reduce our supply bit growth. I'll provide more details on these items later in the call after first reviewing the highlights of the quarter. I'll start with our execution progress. We are focused on improving our cost structure and increasing the mix of high-value solutions in our portfolio, both of which provide immediate benefits and strengthen Micron's ability to drive long term profitable growth. Our cost reductions in DRAM and NAND have meaningfully outpaced the industry over the last three years. Our progress on advanced technology gives us confidence that we will deliver healthy year-over-year cost declines in DRAM and NAND in fiscal 2019, even after taking into account the supply and CapEx changes, which I referenced earlier. In the first quarter, we achieved crossover of 1X nanometer DRAM shipments, and started revenue shipments of 1Y nanometer products. Our 1Y year ramp is ahead of schedule, and we remain on track for meaningful production by the fiscal third quarter. We're also making excellent progress on our 1Z technology, which leverages our leadership in advanced materials and cost effective lithography techniques. In NAND, we continue to lead with our QLC product offerings, and have introduced both consumer QLC and VME SSDs and enterprise QLC SATA SSDs. In the first quarter, we started shipping 96-layer NAND products. Yields on 96-layer are ahead of plan. We remain focused on increasing the mix of high-value solutions in our portfolio and investing in differentiated products for our customers. In DRAM, we introduced our 1Y nanometer 12-gigabit low power DRAM which offers the highest density available for the mobile market. We are seeing strong demand for this product as the market continues to move toward higher densities. In NAND, high-value solutions now represent over 50% of our NAND bits, which is an important milestone for us. The improving mix of high-value solutions increases our gross profit opportunity and provides better margin stability. The strength of our high-value solutions this quarter, which was driven by managed NAND products, helped us maintain overall NAND gross margins above 45%, despite industry oversupply. We strengthened our number one share position in SATA enterprise SSDs, gaining about three percentage points of market share sequentially according to industry reports. In addition to the QLC consumer and VME SSD, mentioned earlier, we also introduced the industry's first one terabyte TLC NVMe automotive SSD in the first quarter. We are working to further expand our NVMe product portfolio and plan to introduce SSDs targeting client, enterprise, and cloud markets through the course of calendar 2019. Looking ahead, we expect the SSD market opportunity will continue to shift from SATA to NVMe. Fiscal 2019 will be a year of transition for our SSD portfolio and we expect our SSD share gains to resume in fiscal 2020. In the meantime, the growth of our high-value NAND solutions in fiscal 2019 will be driven by our mobile managed NAND products, where we believe we have significant opportunity to increase share. In the first quarter, we shipped multiple high-capacity, high-performance UFS solutions, nearly tripling our bit shipments quarter-over-quarter. We continue to make good progress in developing high-value solutions using our 3D XPoint technology and plan to introduce differentiated products towards the end of calendar 2019 as previously discussed. Our conviction in the opportunities ahead is reflected in our October announcement that we intend to exercise our option to acquire Intel's interest in the IMFT Facility in Lehi, Utah, early in calendar 2019. Now, turning to end markets, I will start first with mobile, where we set records for revenue, gross margins, and operating margins in the first fiscal quarter. In addition to strong seasonal sales, we benefited from major product wins with several customers, which is driving our managed NAND share gains. We are seeing strong demand elasticity in this market and within our MCP portfolio, our average NAND density was up over 25% sequentially and over 150% year-on-year. Content growth also continues to do well in mobile DRAM with more than 25% growth in density per unit shipped on a year-on-year basis. We expect content growth to continue in mobile devices, driven by broader use of artificial intelligence, and the increasing number of cameras in the average smartphone. These elements will become pervasive, while the industry readies for 5G implementation. In data center markets, we saw reduced revenue coming off a record-setting fiscal fourth quarter, due primarily to inventory adjustments at our customers. We expect this headwind will persist for a couple of quarters. We are seeing some cloud customers go through a digestion period following very strong growth over the last two years. We believe we are still in the early innings of cloud growth and long-term end customer demand trends remain strong in this market. Our engagement with our customers continues to be deep and now includes collaboration on our 3D XPoint product roadmap. Higher density DRAM products are seeing stronger demand across the data center market. Revenue from our high-density 64-gigabyte DRAM modules grew more than 50% quarter-over-quarter. We are focused on the upcoming industry transition from eight to 16-gigabit DRAM, and expect to start sampling our new 16-gigabit DRAM by our fiscal third quarter. In graphics, we started volume ramp of our high-performance GDDR6 memory and are working closely with our key customers in this segment. Higher than normal inventories in gaming cards and the fall-off in crypto-related demand, created revenue headwinds, which we expect to continue for a couple more quarters. Looking ahead, we see broadening interest in high performance graphics memory for AI enablement in segments like data center and automotive. Our product leadership in GDDR6 is already creating new opportunities in these segments. Turning to markets requiring our long life cycle products, in the fiscal first quarter, we had record revenue in auto and industrial markets with a sequential expansion in gross margins. Strength in automotive continues to be driven by increasing demand for in-vehicle infotainment and advanced driver assistance systems. As a result, we see strong demand for our latest generation of automotive products. In November, we announced a collaboration with BMW to define and validate next-generation automotive solutions. This is another proof point of Micron's leadership in automotive and the growing criticality of memory and storage to leading-edge automotive applications. Turning to our DRAM industry outlook, as I've mentioned previously, DRAM demand weakened through the course of our fiscal first quarter. Since the start of this fiscal second quarter, the weakening demand trend has continued and our near-term visibility is limited. Due to a lengthy period of rising DRAM prices, we believe some of our customers had decided to carry higher than normal inventory levels and as DRAM supply caught up with demand, these customers are bringing down their inventory levels. Smartphone unit demand is also continuing to weaken, particularly at a high end in what is seasonally slow quarter for mobile. Lastly, we are continuing to see the impact of CPU shortages. While our customers and market demand in segments like industrial, cloud, enterprise, and client compute is healthy, this inventory adjustment period will contribute to weaker demand conditions in DRAM that will likely persist through the first half of calendar 2019. We now expect DRAM bit demand growth for the industry in calendar 2019 at approximately 16% compared with our prior expectation of approximately 20%. Even after factoring in the recent CapEx cuts publicly announced across the industry, DRAM supply growth is tracking above our view of demand growth in calendar 2019. Given this supply/demand dynamic, we are taking decisive actions to lower our DRAM bit output growth to approximately 15% for calendar 2019 versus our prior plan of around 20% bit growth. These actions include a significant reduction to our capital expenditures in fiscal year 2019. Based on our current demand estimates, our DRAM bit shipments for the fiscal second quarter will decline sequentially, but more importantly are likely to be flat to down on a year-over-year basis as well consistent with a weak quarter for the memory industry and significantly below the long-term demand growth rate. This shows that inventory adjustments by our customers are well underway. Barring weaker macroeconomic conditions, we expect our DRAM bit demand to grow sequentially in our fiscal third quarter. Looking beyond fiscal Q3, as we enter the second half of calendar 2019, we expect a healthier demand environment alongside an improved industry supply picture, which should contribute to improved financial performance. In NAND, while the inventory levels at customers are in better shape, NAND suppliers appear to have elevated levels of inventory. The transition from planar to 3D NAND in the industry and successful ramp of 64-layer across the NAND manufacturers has resulted in oversupply in the market over the last several quarters. We currently expect calendar 2019 NAND industry bit demand growth to be approximately 35% with ongoing impacts due to client compute CPU shortages and weaker high end smartphone unit demand. Even after taking into account recently publicly announced NAND CapEx reductions for calendar 2019, our assessment is that the NAND industry supply growth will exceed industry demand growth in the coming calendar year. We are, therefore, lowering our 2019 planned NAND bit growth and further reducing our fiscal 2019 NAND CapEx. We now expect our calendar 2019 NAND supply bit growth to be meaningfully reduced from prior expectations and expect our bit shipment growth to be in line with the industry demand at approximately 35%. We also expect NAND demand to accelerate in the second half of the calendar year as demand elasticity kicks in for the mobile, enterprise, and client markets. Given our attractive cost structure on leading-edge NAND and DRAM, in this market environment, we will manage pricing and carry inventory as necessary to optimize our profitability. We are taking decisive action on the supply side to manage our business in a prudent fashion with an eye towards delivering a robust return on our investments. Our actions will significantly reduce our fiscal 2019 CapEx and allow us to continue delivering strong profitability and healthy free cash flow while investing in our strategic priorities as we position Micron to capitalize on the exciting growth opportunities for the company. I'll now turn it over to Dave to provide financial details of our fiscal first quarter and guidance for the second quarter.
David Zinsner: Thanks Sanjay. Micron delivered strong results in our fiscal first quarter, including double-digit year-over-year growth in revenue, gross profits, and earnings per share. While our near-term outlook has become more challenging, the actions taken to improve our cost structure and increase our mix of high-value solutions will ensure that our profitability profile remains strong. Moreover, Micron's financial position remains healthy with an improved net cash position and with total liquidity reaching our target levels. Total fiscal first quarter revenue was $7.9 billion, up 16% from the prior year and down 6% from the record fiscal fourth quarter. Revenue was adversely impacted by inventory adjustments at key customers in the cloud, graphics, and enterprise markets. Offsetting these headwinds, we delivered record revenue in the mobile, industrial, and automotive markets. DRAM represented 68% of total company revenue in the fiscal first quarter. DRAM revenue increased 18% year-over-year and declined 9% from the prior quarter. On a blended basis, DRAM ASPs declines high single-digits percent compared to the prior quarter, while shipment quantities were relatively flat. Trade NAND revenue represented 28% of total company revenue in the fiscal first quarter. Trade NAND revenue increased 17% year-over-year and declined 2% quarter-over-quarter. Our overall NAND ASP declined in the low to mid-teens percent and shipment quantities increased in the low to mid-teens percent compared to the prior quarter. Now, turning to our revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the compute and networking business unit was $3.6 billion, up 12% year-on-year and down 17% quarter-on-quarter. The sequential decline was driven by the impact of inventory adjustments at some of our customers in the graphics, enterprise and cloud markets. The mobile business unit delivered a strong quarter with record revenue of $2.2 billion, revenue increased 62% year-over-year and 17% from the prior quarter. Revenue growth was driven by the continued strength of our low-power DRAM offerings and share gains in our mobile managed NAND business with several leading handset customers. Embedded business unit revenue of $933 million was up 12% year-on-year and up 1% quarter-on-quarter. The automotive and industrial business -- businesses had record revenue, driven by strong sales of our DRAM and NOR products. And finally, turning to the storage business unit, or SBU, fiscal first quarter revenue was $1.1 billion, down 17% year-on-year and 8% quarter-on-quarter. The sequential decline in revenue was driven by weaker pricing and the ongoing transition from SATA to NVMe SSDs. The impact of this transition will continue through calendar 2019. Our strategy to move bits from SBU components to high-value solutions in mobile is also contributing to a decline in revenue for SBU. The consolidated gross margin for the fiscal first quarter was 59%, up 360 basis points from the prior year and down approximately 230 basis points from the prior quarter. This includes a 120 basis point impact from 3D XPoint underutilization costs. During the last few months, we successfully leveraged our global supply chain to mitigate the impact of the China trade tariffs to less than 50 basis points to our consolidated fiscal first quarter gross margin. We expect to be able to mitigate approximately 90% of the impact from tariffs starting in January 2019. We believe that Micron will not be directly impacted by any expansion of trade tariffs to additional product categories. Operating expenses were $783 million, slightly above our guidance, mainly due to higher than expected prequalification expenses associated with new product introductions. Looking forward, as our joint development work with Intel comes to a conclusion around the end of this fiscal year; the R&D cost sharing between the companies will naturally reduce and come to an end. In the fiscal first quarter, Intel's share of joint R&D expenses was approximately $30 million. We expect that our R&D expenses will continue to increase in the coming quarters due to the combination of these declining R&D contributions from Intel as well as increased investments in future technologies and high-value solutions across our portfolio. We continue to drive strong profitability in the fiscal first quarter with operating income of $3.9 billion, representing 49% of revenue. This margin is up three percentage points year-over-year and down three percentage points from the fiscal fourth quarter. As previously mentioned, the improvements that Micron has made over the prior several years have resulted in structurally higher margins. The tax rate for the fiscal first quarter was 10% and we expect our fiscal year 2019 tax rate to be around 11%. Non-GAAP earnings per share in the fiscal first quarter totaled $2.97, up from $2.45 in the year ago quarter and down from $3.53 in the prior quarter. We commenced our capital return program in the fiscal first quarter with the repurchase of $1.8 billion of common stock, representing a reduction of approximately 42 million shares or about 3.5% of shares outstanding. We expect to remain active with our stock buybacks in the fiscal second quarter, as we continue to make progress on our $10 billion repurchase program by returning at least 50% of our ongoing free cash flows to shareholders. Turning to cash flows and capital spending, in the fiscal first quarter, we generated $4.8 billion in cash from operations, representing 61% of revenue. Capital spending, net of third-party contributions was $2.5 billion, up from $2.1 billion in the prior quarter. In the fiscal first quarter, our free cash flow was approximately $2.3 billion, up about $600 million from the year ago quarter and down approximately $750 million from the prior quarter. We deployed approximately 80% of the quarter's free cash flow towards our share repurchase program. Even with the substantial outlay for share repurchases, we ended the fiscal quarter in a record net cash position of $3.1 billion with approximately $7.2 billion in cash, marketable investments, and restricted cash and $4.1 billion in debt. While we largely completed our deleveraging activities in fiscal year 2018, we further reduced our debt balance in the quarter by approximately $500 million through the settlement of outstanding convertible note redemptions of $160 million and other scheduled payments. Overall, our solid balance sheet, strong cash flow, and robust liquidity put us in an excellent position to execute on our capital returns program. Prior to issuing our fiscal second quarter guidance, I'd like to provide some context for our outlook. Due to the weaker demand environment, we expect fiscal second quarter sequential bit shipments to be down meaningfully for both NAND and DRAM. Given the weaker near-term outlook, we are lowering our CapEx plans to a range of $9 billion to $9.5 billion for fiscal 2019. At the midpoint, this represents a $1.25 billion reduction from our prior guidance and our front end equipment CapEx is now down year-on-year. We'll continue to remain flexible with capital spending to respond to market conditions. With that in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for the fiscal second quarter is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $5.7 billion to $6.3 billion, and gross margins to be in the range of 50% to 53%. Operating expenses are expected to be $800 million, plus or minus $25 million. As we execute on longer term growth investments, we're actively managing OpEx by implementing expense controls across the company, including tighter controls on headcount, holiday work schedule slowdowns, and reductions in discretionary spending. Based on a share count of approximately 1.15 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $1.75, plus or minus $0.10. In closing, Micron continues to deliver solid financial results on a stronger performance foundation. We are making progress on all of our key initiatives including our high-value solutions product portfolio, our cost profile, capital return program, and financial structure with a record net cash position and $9.7 billion of liquidity at the end of the fiscal first quarter. While near-term market conditions are challenging, we are taking appropriate steps to manage production and spending in order to deliver healthy, profitability, and cash flows. There is no doubt Micron remains in the strongest financial position in the company's history as we transition to next-generation technologies and products. I'll now turn the call over to Sanjay for some concluding remarks.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Dave. While we end calendar 2018 on the heels of unprecedented profitability and revenue for both Micron and the industry, we do believe we are entering a period of weaker market conditions. We are taking prudent actions to adapt our manufacturing plans to the changing demand environment. While we are implementing expense controls, we are also continuing to invest in our technology and cost competitiveness as well as strengthening our portfolio of high-value solutions. Memory and storage have become essential ingredients to the value created by the data economy and it is this added value that is driving a virtual cycle of long-term growth and innovation. We continue to believe that the memory industry is structurally stronger with more diversified demand drivers and moderating supply growth capability. Micron is better positioned than ever before to win in this environment with our strong balance sheet and the structural improvements we have made to our operating model in the past several years. We believe 2019 will be a year of solid profitability and I look forward to sharing our results over the quarters ahead. We will now open for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open.
Tim Arcuri: Thank you. Sanjay, I was wondering if you could help quantify the inventory at your big hyper scale customers. It sounds like in aggregate its maybe two months. So, I'm wondering if you can help with that number. Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, inventory at our customers and this is -- customers in various segments of our market, some of those customers are carrying higher levels of inventory, and that inventory level varies from customer to customer we believe. And our assessment is that inventory adjustments will take couple of quarters for it to be corrected, for it to work through the system entirely and, of course, we continue to work with our customers in the meantime, in terms of understanding their longer term demand requirements. And certainly, our customers are indicating optimism towards the demand requirements in the second half of the year. And especially, as inventory adjustments work through the system and as supply cuts, the effect of those come through the industry, as well as second half of the calendar year tends to be seasonally stronger compared to the first half of the year, we do expect that by the second half of the year, we'll have an environment that will be improved stronger compared to the first half of the year. And just keep in mind that the long-term demand trends in our end markets of cloud, client, enterprise, graphics all of these end markets, the trends continue to be strong, needing more memory and more storage ultimately. We're just going through an air pocket here related to primarily inventory adjustments as well as some seasonal, weak mobile demand, including mobile demand on the high end smartphones that is impacting some of our near-term visibility as well as the near-term outlook.
Tim Arcuri: Thank you for that. And then I guess just as a quick follow-up, Dave. So, I think maybe the surprise in the guidance that the bit shipments are down, I think you said, meaningfully for both NAND and DRAM. I'm wondering, what that means for inventories? Are you going to ship out of inventory? Or are you cutting utilization? Can you sort of walk us through that? Thank you.
David Zinsner: So, we are reducing our production for both DRAM and NAND. As Sanjay indicated, from a DRAM perspective, we're bringing bit supply growth down to 15% approximately in calendar year 2019. For NAND, we're also bringing the production down meaningfully and we did indicate that we would ship close to demand for NAND and we think that demand is about 35%. So, obviously, there will be periods of time, where we do have inventory increasing for some period of time and then, of course, it will adjust down through the years as we -- as those demand and supply numbers get more aligned. In the first quarter, we had days of inventory up to 107 days, I'm very comfortable with 107 days. This is very low cost product that we're putting on the balance sheet. There is no risk around obsolescence, it's part -- it's very likely that we'll go up again next quarter; again, I'm very comfortable with that. But I think over the long-term, we'll have it more aligned with ultimately where we want it to be.
Tim Arcuri: Thank you, Dave.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John Pitzer: Yes, good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Dave, just relative to the guidance for OpEx in February quarter of $800 million, plus or minus $25 million, does that now reflect, what we should think about as a fully burdened OpEx as you kind of move away from the shared cost with Intel? And relative to the $6 billion of operational efficiency gains, you talked about at the Analyst Day, this past summer, how does that fit in with this OpEx guide? Because this is about $200 million more OpEx per quarter than we saw at similar revenue levels back in sort of 2016, 2017, and it's about $300 million above per quarter what we saw kind of in the 2015 sort of correction?
David Zinsner: Yes, good question. So, we did guide $800 million for OpEx in the second quarter, plus or minus $25 million. That's probably -- that's certainly not fully burdened. We had about $30 million of benefit in the first fiscal quarter related to Intel's contribution through R&D expenses. It will be a little bit less in the second quarter, but over the course of the rest of the year will kind of phase down. So, that certainly will elevate the OpEx in the third and fourth quarter relative to the second quarter. And also, we're not -- while we are certainly managing expenses prudently and we are taking steps in terms of reducing discretionary spending and just monitoring our headcount very closely, we still are making the necessary investments on the product side and the technology side. This is, as Sanjay mentioned, an air pocket, we don't want to in any way, impact our long-term strategy for some sort of near-term event. So, OpEx will likely go up a little bit. It's a fair point on the OpEx. I would say, if you look at the guidance for the second quarter or even with the revenue guidance we gave relative to what the first quarter was like, if you take the kind of midpoint of the earnings number, and the midpoint of the revenue guidance number, you'll get kind of 38% plus operating margin. So, that is a really good number obviously. It's a number of, in my previous company; we were kind of aspirationally trying to get to. So, it's a very good operation -- operating margin number. And I think it reflects the fact that we achieved the $6 billion of improvements that we said we would make at the Analyst Day. We still think we have more work to do in terms of driving the mix towards high-value solutions in terms of improving our cost competitiveness, both on the front-end and on the back-end side. So, there is more to come, there is another $3 billion that we committed and we feel very good about that.
John Pitzer: And then as my follow-up for Sanjay, can you just walk us through the strategic puts and takes of building inventory into the February quarter as opposed to trying to let those bits out into the marketplace and let elasticity sort of take over? Is this sort of intangible reflection of your view that this will be relatively short-lived a couple of quarters? And what would you need to see before you would think that inventory build was too risky?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, I think our inventory, our cost structure is very good, both on DRAM as well as on the NAND side. And so we are definitely prepared that in terms of managing our overall profitability, which is absolutely our primary focus, that we'll manage pricing and manage inventory accordingly as necessary. If inventory has to be carried over, we will carry it over because the demand in NAND will kick-in with elasticity. In DRAM, the inventory consumption with our customers will occur; supply cuts will be driving return to stronger demand environment compared to -- in the second half compared to first half. So, we will be using inventory as a lever to ultimately manage for the best profitability of the company. And certainly, be prepared, use that inventory as necessary to also capitalize on the second half opportunities. And our focus really will also remain that in terms of our CAGR, in terms of output growth to be aligned with demand CAGR, and we'll of course from time-to-time use inventory as a lever to manage the profitability of our business and, of course, manage our customers' requirements as well.
John Pitzer: Thank you.
David Zinsner: Thank you, John.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is now open.
C.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, can you talk about what you're thinking in terms of cost down efforts both for DRAM and NAND, particularly as you move to higher-value solutions changing mix, including 1Y, 1Z as well as 96 layers in the 2019 timeframe?
Sanjay Mehrotra: With respect to the cost structure, we continue to be in very good position, as we said that for our fiscal year 2019, we'll have healthy cost reductions, both for NAND as well as DRAM. And you're of course right to note that as we increase the mix of our high-value solutions, for example, over the longer term as we increase our SSD mix or increase our managed NAND solutions, those do tend to incur higher costs. But they also bring higher margins, higher profitability, higher pricing associated with them as well. So, cost wise, we are in good shape.
C.J. Muse: That's helpful. And I guess, as a follow-up, a question for you Dave. I think in the past you've talked about wanting to have liquidity including gross cash and revolver of roughly one year CapEx, which would basically put you on the screws here. So, the question is how to think about incremental free cash flow generation? And what percentage of that would be used for buybacks?
David Zinsner: Yes, good question C.J. So, we contribute -- let's start with the -- we're at about $9.7 billion of liquidity when you count the cash that we have on the balance sheet, plus the $2.5 billion revolver we have. So, we're in, as you point out, very good shape relative to where our target liquidity would be. You saw a pretty healthy return of cash to shareholders in the first quarter. About 80% of our free cash flow went to shareholders in the form of the buyback, and really, the rest went to further deleverage the balance sheet. There's not a ton of deleveraging that will go on through the rest of the year, quite honestly. And so I would expect us to be -- continue to be good buyers of the stock, so to speak, through the next three quarters and contribute a high portion of our free cash flow in the form of a buyback.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Mark Newman with Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Mark Newman: Yes, thanks for taking my question. First question really, I'd like to ask on the supply adjustments you're making, you're taking down the guidance for both DRAM and NAND reduction. You mentioned about some of that being inventory, but you also mentioned some of that being some reduction adjustments. It would be useful to understand a bit more about that. For example, is that reduction of utilization? Is that a no more capacity additions or what is that? Because some of your competitors have been pushing out some of their capacity additions and so it would be useful to understand what Micron is doing here, on the capacity adjustments to get this slightly lower bit growth that you are forecasting for calendar 2019?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, certainly, we are taking actions, a range of actions and we won't really get into any specifics here in terms of what actions we are taking to reduce our output. You earlier mentioned about inventory. I mean, of course, we will carry inventory as necessary to manage the profitability. But important thing to understand is that we are taking decisive actions in terms of reducing our production output both in NAND as well as in DRAM. And that's the contributor to the $1.25 billion reduction in CapEx compared to our prior guidance. And of course, our intention here is to align our supply output in line with the industry demand trends and we feel very good about the actions we have taken. In DRAM, we've pointed out that compared to our prior expectations of 20% supply bit growth in calendar 2019; we have taken actions now to reduce our output to provide a 15% supply output growth on a year-over-year basis. And in DRAM as well, we have taken actions to adjust our output so that our shipments will match with our demand that we expect to be around 35% in 2019. And just want to be very clear as we have always said, that we are not adding any new wafer capacity. We are -- the CapEx that we discussed today, the lowered CapEx that we discussed, which on a wafer equipment basis is a reduction from fiscal year 2018 CapEx is all going towards technology transitions only. And that of course is the best way to achieve the ROI on those investments.
Mark Newman: So, does that mean slower technology migration or does it perhaps mean slightly lower utilization for temporary period?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, Mark, I'm not going to get into the specifics. Most important thing is, we have managed our CapEx lower and we continue to take actions to manage our production output lower to align our supply with our demand expectations. And I think the effect of these actions will in fact -- some of these actions will start showing as early as this quarter.
David Zinsner: And if you look at--
Mark Newman: Thanks Sanjay and then--
David Zinsner: Go ahead. Sorry Mark.
Mark Newman: I'm sorry, you go ahead Dave.
David Zinsner: I was just going to say, if you look at our gross margin, it would reflect that we have a very good cost structure for our products.
Sanjay Mehrotra: And the reduction of these outputs that we are talking about, our cost structure will remain in very good shape even with that. And in fact, in terms of cost, on a year-over-year basis, we actually, our cost reductions we believe both in DRAM and NAND will be above the industry. Cost reductions remain above the industry, yes.
Mark Newman: My follow-up question is on the demand. You talked about this a little bit of inventory correction amongst customers; some of your competitors have talked a bit about that as well. But you seem to be reasonably confident that demand is going to come back second half of calendar 2019, which also suggests that the inventory should have been burnt up by then. The customer's inventory should have been used up mostly by then. It would just be helpful, do you have any data points to explain how you get that confidence that demand will come back? Is it perhaps on the NAND side more about demand elasticity? Is it on the DRAM side? Anything about the kind of magnitude of the inventory level the customers have to pay to give us some kind of sense that -- confidence that would've been used up within a couple of quarters for example that'll be great -- that would be very helpful. Thanks.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, first of all, I think we should realize that the end market demand trends, by and large, really remain quite healthy and our customers also are absolutely continuing to show to us the optimism around the long-term demand trends. And as we noted in my remarks, that in our fiscal second quarter, the bits for DRAM -- let me first talk about DRAM here, the bits for DRAM will be down on a year-over-year basis and this needs to be compared with the long-term DRAM demand CAGR of 20%, high teens to 20% range. So, then in FQ2, on a year-over-year basis, you reduction and you contrast it with the long-term demand trends of 20% kind of demand growth, then it tells you that during fiscal second quarter, a lot of the inventory adjustments will certainly be occurring. And that's why we say that it will take couple of quarters for inventory adjustments to occur. So, again, the point about year-over-year reduction in our DRAM shipments is an important point in understanding that the inventory adjustment by our customers is well underway. And all of this while the end market demand drivers of cloud, as you see from all the data, is absolutely continuing to be healthy. The end market demand driver in terms of average capacity increases of flash and smartphones as well as DRAM content and smartphones driven by AI and machine learning continues to be on the upward trend. And of course, applications like automotive and industrial IoT with more AI and more machine learning all of these are continuing to drive the demand trends towards need for more storage and more memory. And we laid out some of these opportunities at our Investor Day and all of those opportunities very much stay intact and at the end market level continue to be vibrant. So, I think these couple of points that the November quarter itself was in terms of overall shipment was below seasonal as well as the first quarter on a year-over-year basis really showing reduction points to inventory adjustments are well underway. And of course, you have to look at this in the backdrop that the output in the industry is coming down as well. We have announced our decisive actions here today and we have provided the outlook in terms of our output growth in calendar year 2019, both for NAND as well as DRAM. So, these -- and then, as I said before, that second half of the year tends to be a seasonally stronger part in terms of demand compared to the first half. So, these all are definitely pointing to our confidence, and built up on inputs from our customers in terms of second half of the year being stronger than the first half of the year in terms of -- in demand trends and the industry fundamentals as well. And let me just point out one more thing here that, when you look at industry, I mean, compared to the past cycles, really the CapEx cuts are happening at much, much earlier level in the cycle and really, in terms of happening even at much higher levels of profitability than ever in the past. So, all this, overall, I believe, bodes well for the long term fundamentals of the industry as well as certainly for Micron.
Mark Newman: All right. Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate that.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thank you for taking the questions. I was wondering if I could build on that last comment, you've talked a lot about your own plans in terms of curtailing your capacity expansion this year. But given that you are in off quarter, off calendar quarter, I'm just curious of how you will characterize maybe the competitive landscape? Maybe what you've seen change over the last month and a half or so relative to some of your competitors in the context of both DRAM and NAND? And I have a follow-up.
Sanjay Mehrotra: I think in that regard, you know as much as I do and over the course of last couple of months, there have been a reduction that have been discussed in the industry, the reductions that you have heard about that manufacturers have talked about, but also, several analysts have indicated those as well. And of course, the near-term outlook has also as we said, continued to weaken through the course of our FQ1 timeframe and even since our FQ2 has started, those demand weakening trends have continued as well. So, I think this is the information that is out there, is what we're using, but we can only talk about ourselves and we can -- we certainly have taken here decisive actions in terms of managing our output growth in line with our demand expectations.
Aaron Rakers: Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, just thinking about your product portfolio, particularly, around the enterprise SSD market, I'm curious, it sounds like possibly you're seeing maybe even a quicker ramp towards NVMe than what you previously have seen. I mean is there a way to kind of quantify how much of maybe the enterprise SSD market is kind of moving away from you? And so you get your products into the market in the latter part of this calendar year -- or calendar year 2019?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Certainly, as we have been speaking for a while, the transition from SATA to NVMe is taking place at a fast pace, in enterprise, as well as in cloud applications. And we have been focused on developing our own products. And that's why, we have said that in calendar year -- our fiscal year 2019, as we bring out our new NVMe products to the market, our 2019 calendar year ends up being more a year of transition for us. But there is no question that the market certainly is moving from SATA to NVMe applications across the Board. And we have just introduced some of our early NVMe products for consumer SSDs and I talked about how we have introduced NVMe product for automotive, applications as well. And during the course of calendar 2019, we'll first be bringing out client NVMe products to the market and then later in the year, we'll bring enterprise and cloud NVMe SSDs. And that's why, we look at calendar year 2020 will be the one timeframe, when we start gaining share again in our SSDs -- SSD market.
Aaron Rakers: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura. Your line is now open.
Romit Shah: Yes. Thank you. Sanjay, I heard you indicate that you expect above average cost declines, but I guess my question is, aren't the actions that you've announced today probably more of a hit to cost per bit in 2020 versus 2019? How do we think about that?
Sanjay Mehrotra: I think what we have shown you today is that we are able to take decisive actions and we are able to take them fast. I mean, just remember that FQ4 was a record year for the company and FQ1, is when we first saw signs of inventory adjustment. During the course of FQ1, we have been able to react in terms of cutting down our CapEx as well as manage our output growth. So, point is we can react fast to the changes that are needed in the marketplace and we remain -- this is something we review very, very closely on an ongoing basis, very focused on making sure that we are maximizing the long term profitability and long-term growth opportunity for Micron. So, this is something that in terms of cost, we feel very good about our position for 2019 and beyond -- going beyond that. We of course continue to make very good progress on our technology nodes. As I discussed with you, our technology on 1Z is progressing well. We feel good about that roadmap and continue to make good progress on our NAND roadmap as well. And that will all position us well for 2019 as well as for 2020 timeframe. And I just want to point out that our focus also is on shifting our portfolio to high-value solutions and those will also strengthen our profitability profile.
Romit Shah: I guess as my follow-up on CapEx, I mean, you are cutting your forecast for the year, but CapEx is still up on a year-on-year basis. I'm curious if this downturn ends up being longer than any of us sort of anticipate? Is there a leverage to reduce CapEx any further from its current levels?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, I will just touch on CapEx, on your previous question on your cost, I also wanted to point out that on the cost side, we are making tremendous progress on the back-end assembly and test cost reductions as well as managing, transforming our supply chain operations, which will give us significant cost benefits as well. So, all-in all, 2019 and beyond, feel very good about our technology roadmap, manufacturing roadmap, capability as well as overall cost capabilities. In terms of, on the CapEx side, just keep in mind, that we have said that with the adjustments that we just have made, over wafer equipment CapEx actually is coming down in fiscal year 2019 versus fiscal year 2018. And as we've discussed before, Micron over the last few years have significantly underinvested in clean room shell CapEx in the facilities and the buildings that are needed to really implement ongoing future technology transition and big part of our CapEx as we have shared with you the past, actually is going towards buildings and facilities, clean room that will be needed for future technology transitions as well. All of that CapEx does not contribute to bit growth. And similarly, we have significant increase in our CapEx in fiscal year 2019 over fiscal year 2018 on back-end test and assembly operations as well. And that is again intended to reduce costs, and not -- it doesn't go towards any bit growth. And we have flexibility, as we have shown already, in terms of managing CapEx. We will continue to look at this carefully and if any factors require us to change our CapEx outlook again, we will absolutely address it in a timely and prudent fashion. We always continue to evaluate market environment as well as our own status of technology, transitions, production requirements, and we are making real-time adjustments as needed.
Romit Shah: I mean it seems like the actions you guys are taking are very prudent, but I -- the part that's confusing for me is if you're slowing your process migration, then there should be some impact to cost per bit. And I'm just, I guess I'm just not quite -- I just don't quite understand what that impact is?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Again, in terms of cost per bit, there are a lot of details that have to be looked at. We're not going to get into all of those details here. Key message here is that we are bringing our production output in line with our demand expectations. Second, we feel very good about our technology position and our cost position, and will continue to do very well in this regard. Cost position, of course, includes wafer level, die cost position but also, includes the benefits of assembly and test cost improvements that we are making. And third, as we absolutely stay focused on our high-value solutions strategy, and we're executing well in the area, we talked about how in mobile, even in a market environment of significant NAND oversupply, we actually have delivered strong gains in our mobile high-value solutions portfolio as well.
Romit Shah: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session for today. Thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude the program and we may all disconnect. Everybody, have a wonderful day.

Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Farhan. Good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter results contributed to a year of unprecedented success for the Company. With record profitability and revenue over $30 billion, Micron ended fiscal 2018 as the second largest semiconductor company in the U.S. The new Micron is undergoing a fundamental transformation, driven by our 34,000-plus employees around the world whom I would like to thank for their intense focus on our key priorities. Our markets are propelled by diversified, secular growth trends, our industry is more rational and the Micron team is executing well against the Company’s strategy. Over the last 12 months, we have sharpened our focus on improving our cost structure and on increasing the mix of high-value solutions in our portfolio, all of which position as well for the future. Our technology roadmap and manufacturing execution is driving strong cost reductions for the Company. Over the last year, we have increased production DRAM bits per wafer at a higher rate than the industry, reducing the cost gap with competitors. We are on track to achieve total bit output crossover on 1X nanometer DRAM in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and have already achieved bit shipment crossover for 1X nanometer in the client and graphics markets in the fourth quarter. We expect 1Y nanometer sales to commence before the end of calendar 2019 with meaningful production increases beginning in the fiscal third quarter as previously announced new cleanroom space comes on line at our Hiroshima facility. We’re also making good progress on our 1Z nanometer technology development. In NAND, cost reductions and mix improvements have helped us deliver sequential gross margin expansion even as pricing declined in the industry. At this time last year, our bit output share was meaningfully below our wafer market share. Over the last 12 months through the strong execution of our 64-layer ramp and a higher mix of TLC, we have reversed this trend and now have our bit share ahead of our wafer share. We remain on track to move 96-layer NAND into production this calendar year and we’ll continue to ramp it next year, which should provide us with solid cost reductions in fiscal 2019. We have already commercialized CMOS under the array, QLC and array stacking on 3D NAND while most competitors still have these challenges ahead of them. Our technology leadership positions us well for the year ahead and we’re pleased with the headway we are making on our fourth generation 3D NAND technology, which uses a replacement gate architecture. We also made excellent progress increasing our mix of higher value added solutions, delivering record revenue in our SSD and multichip package products this quarter. Our enterprise and cloud SSD quarterly revenues more than doubled year-over-year, as we strengthened our position in SATA SSDs. A third-party research firm recently recognized Micron as the number one market share leader in enterprise SATA. We achieved well over $2 billion in annual SSD revenue in fiscal 2018. Our first generation NVMe SSD is in the final stages of product development. Looking ahead, we are focused on introducing new NVMe SSDs over the course of the next several quarters. Consumer and client NVMe SSDs will come first and then late in calendar 2019 cloud and enterprise NVMe drives. As the market rapidly shifts to NVMe, 2019 will be a year of transition for us following solid SSD share gains in 2018, and we expect to start growing SSD share again in 2020 with a fuller product portfolio. We also look forward to leveraging our market advantage with QLC SSDs in 2019 and beyond. Fiscal Q4 saw a continuation of our stellar performance in managed NAND growth with MCP revenues growing 21%, sequentially. MCPs are used in the vast majority of smartphones, and we have robust demand from customers for these products. We are focused on growing MCP revenues and are introducing new, differentiated products to enhance our portfolio. In the fourth quarter, our new 128 gigabyte NAND plus 4 gigabyte DRAM MCP ramped revenue faster than any other managed NAND product in our history, demonstrating our strong execution, as well as the market demand for high-capacity, high-value MCPs for flagship smartphones. We are pleased with our progress and believe we still have a lot of room to grow in this market over the coming year. Now, turning to highlights by market. More than one-third of our total revenues in fiscal 2018 were from data center and graphics. Our annual revenues in these markets have more than doubled year-over-year. We are confident about the long-term demand growth in this market as AI and big data analytics continue to create new value for end customers. Our collaboration with customers in these markets is deep and we work closely with them to bring new technologies to market. For example, in Q4, we started shipping a new custom persistent memory solution to a large hyperscale company. In graphics, NVIDIA chose us as the lead GDDR6 partner for their GeForce RTX products, and we expect to see strong growth in our GDDR6 shipments in fiscal 2019. We are also collaborating with customers on 3D XPoint solutions and expect to start sampling products in late calendar 2019. Markets requiring our long lifecycle products make-up more than 15% of our revenues. We win in these markets on high quality, deep partnerships, committed long-term support, and the best of our DRAM, NAND and NOR product portfolios. These businesses in our portfolio typically show higher stability in revenues, profitability and cash flows, and are supported by secular growth drivers such as autonomous driving, networking, IoT and industrial automation. Our automotive business had record revenues in the quarter. We have a strong design win pipeline for automotive products with a lifetime value of several billion dollars. To support our long-term growth in these markets, we recently announced a multi-year $3 billion investment to expand our fab in Manassas, Virginia, over the next decade. This site will be a world-class center of excellence for developing and manufacturing these long lifecycle solutions. Turning to mobile. The market continues to grow, driven by content increases for DRAM and NAND across all frontiers. We shipped our first high-performance UFS managed NAND products in the fourth quarter and expect this to be a growth area for us in fiscal 2019. We delivered record results in mobile with revenues up 8% sequentially, driven by strength in NAND as we grew NAND bits 80% quarter-on-quarter. DRAM and NAND content will continue to grow in mobile devices in fiscal 2019, driven by customer preferences and the need to support new camera and digital features, utilizing machine learning. Looking at the industry broadly. Calendar 2018 has been a phenomenal year so far with the total DRAM and NAND TAM on track to reach record highs, and total industry revenues forecasted to grow 29% year-over-year to $168 billion. As we discussed at our Investor Day event, we expect industry cyclicality to be more dampened than in the past as industry supply growth from node transitions slows structurally and supply growth requires higher levels of CapEx. In addition, we continue to see robust diversified demand drivers and are confident in the long-term outlook for our business. Turning to bit growth. In DRAM, we see the calendar 2018 industry bit output growth tracking slightly above 20% with Micron growing in line with the industry. NAND industry bit output growth is tracking close to 45% in calendar 2018, and we expect to grow, roughly in line with the industry. Looking ahead to calendar 2019, we plan to grow DRAM bits in line with estimated industry growth of approximately 20% and plan to grow NAND bits somewhat above our expectation of industry growth of 35% to 40%. In fiscal 2019, we expect that DRAM profitability will remain strong as the market continues to benefit from long-term structural growth drivers and from structurally slowing supply growth. Turning to NAND, we have seen an acceleration in supply growth in calendar 2018, driven by the ramp of highly efficient 64-layer 3D NAND across the industry. Looking ahead, we expect the moderation in supply growth, beginning in the first half of calendar 2019 as the industry transitions to more challenging, 96-layer designs, which provide less benefits node-over-node. We also expect higher demands due to elasticity, resulting in higher SSD adoption and increasing average capacities across multiple end markets. In our fiscal first quarter, we see some impact to our client compute customers, due to a shortage of CPUs. In addition, there is some limited inventory adjustments underway at a few customers but the end customer demand remains solid. Turning to CapEx. Dave will provide more details, but I want to emphasize that our fiscal 2019 CapEx plans are consistent with our strategy to focus on technology transitions while maintaining existing wafer capacity. As we have highlighted previously, future technology transitions in NAND and DRAM require substantially more cleanroom space than prior nodes. As a result, our fiscal 2019 CapEx related to manufacturing facility construction and facility upgrades is increasing by nearly $2 billion year-over-year, primarily due to our previously announced NAND and DRAM cleanroom expansions. This investment will provide us a flexibility to better manage our manufacturing operations and drive the manufacturing ramp of new technologies in a timely manner. As I reflect on the tremendous progress we have made improving our competitive position this year and amazing opportunities that drive our industry, I’m very excited about my Micron’s future. Against this backdrop, we certainly view our stock as being undervalued at current prices and are aggressively implementing our stock buyback program. We will continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet and use strong free cash flow to support our $10 billion buyback and assess opportunities to accelerate the timeline for its completion. With that I will pass this over to Dave.
Dave Zinsner: Thank you, Sanjay, and good afternoon, everyone. Micron continues to perform exceptionally well and delivered strong financial results in the fourth quarter. We set new records for revenue, gross margin, free cash flow, and earnings per share. In addition, we continued to strengthen our financial foundation, achieving our highest ever net cash position. Total fiscal fourth quarter revenue was $8.4 billion, up 8% from fiscal third quarter and 38% from the prior year. For fiscal 2018, total revenue was $30.4 billion, up 50% from fiscal 2017. Gross margins for the quarter expanded to a record 61%, up approximately 50 basis points from the prior quarter and up from 51% in the prior year. In the fiscal fourth quarter, we saw the benefit of strong execution on technology transitions for both DRAM and NAND. This strong execution resulted in a significant sequential cost decline, which drove expanded gross margins in both DRAM and NAND. For fiscal 2018, gross margins were 59%, up from 43% in fiscal 2017. Operating expenses came in at $740 million, approximately flat from fiscal third quarter 2018, as previously communicated. Moving forward, we expect to increase our investments in R&D for fiscal 2019 as we add resources to expand our portfolio of new, high-value solutions and phase out partner contributions for technology development. Our record revenue and gross margin performance drove strong profitability in the fiscal fourth quarter, and operating income grew to $4.4 billion, representing 53% of revenue. This compares with operating margins of 52% in fiscal third quarter and 41% in the year-ago period. Now, turning to our revenue trends by business unit. We achieved record revenue for the compute and networking business unit, up $4.4 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, up 9% from the prior quarter and 53% year-over-year. Growth trends were strong in cloud and graphics, which almost doubled year-on-year. Fiscal fourth quarter operating income in CNBU was up 11% sequentially to $2.9 billion or 67% of revenue. Revenues for the mobile business unit increased to a record $1.9 billion, up 8% quarter-over-quarter and 60% year-over-year. Sequential growth was primarily led by multichip packages and discreet managed NAND. Fiscal fourth quarter operating income increased 14% quarter-over-quarter to a record $979 million or 52% of revenue. The embedded business unit continues to deliver solid results with record revenue of $923 million, up 3% versus fiscal third quarter and up 12% year-over-year. Sequential growth was driven by the automotive and industrial markets. Fiscal fourth quarter operating income in EBU was $382 million or 41% of revenue. And finally, turning to the storage business unit, fourth quarter revenue was $1.2 billion, up 9% sequentially and down 4% year-over-year. We set a record for overall SSD revenues, driven by our continued success in the SATA SSD market. Fiscal fourth quarter operating income in SBU was $157 million or 13% of revenue, which included the impact from the underutilization charges related to 3D XPoint. And now, moving to performance by product line. DRAM represented 70% of total Company revenue in fiscal fourth quarter. DRAM revenue was up 7% from the prior quarter and 47% year-over-year as Micron executed well in a robust market environment. On a blended basis, ASPs were flat to the prior quarter, while shipment quantities were up mid to upper single digits percent. Gross margins for DRAM were 71%, up from 69% in the prior quarter as costs benefited from the ramp of our 1X nanometer technology. Trade NAND revenue represented 26% of total Company revenue in fiscal fourth quarter. Trade NAND revenue was up 15% quarter-over-quarter and 21% year-over-year, driven by strong sequential growth in managed NAND products. Our overall NAND ASP decreased in the mid-teens percentage range and shipment quantities increased in the mid-30 percentage range compared to the prior quarter. Trade NAND gross margins were 48%, up 50 basis points from the prior quarter and up 720 basis points from the year-ago quarter, driven by robust cost reductions and product mix improvements. Our solid execution and healthy industry environment led to a record non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.53, up 12% from the prior quarter and 75% from the prior year. For the full fiscal 2018, we achieved net income of $14.7 billion or $11.95 per share, compared with $5.6 billion or $4.96 per share for fiscal 2017. In the fiscal fourth quarter, we generated a record $5.2 billion in cash from operations, representing 61% of revenue. Micron has historically shown strong cash flows from operations, even in our most difficult years. And our current cash flow levels are now structurally higher as we have made significant improvements on our underlying cost competiveness and enhanced our product mix. Capital spending net of third-party contributions was $2.1 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter and $8.2 billion for the fiscal year. While our annual capital spending was well below our CapEx model of low-30s as a percent of revenue in fiscal 2018, we do plan to increase our CapEx as a percent of revenue in fiscal 2019. We currently expect our fiscal 2019 CapEx net of partner contributions to be in the range of $10.5 billion, plus or minus 5%. Our investments will continue to be focused on technology transitions for DRAM and NAND while maintaining flat wafer capacity. We expect that about 25% of our capital spending will be associated with facilities expansions and facilities upgrades needed for successful technology transitions. These expansion and upgrade projects are underway, and as a result, CapEx will be more weighted towards the first half of the fiscal year. Our strategy is to be flexible and disciplined regarding our CapEx, and we will be responsive to market conditions. As an example, we’ve cut back our fab equipment CapEx for NAND in fiscal 2019, compared to fiscal 2018 levels. In the fourth quarter, our free cash flow was $3.1 billion, up $900 million from the third quarter and up nearly $1.4 billion from the prior year period. Free cash flow for the full fiscal year was $9.2 billion compared to $3.3 billion last fiscal year. We ended the fiscal year in a record net cash position of $2.7 billion, with approximately $7.4 billion in cash, marketable investments, and restricted cash, and $4.6 billion in debt. During the fiscal year, we used $9.4 billion for the repurchase or prepayment of debt and redemptions of converts, and reduced our debt position by $6.5 billion. In the fiscal fourth quarter alone, we reduced our debt position by approximately $2.7 billion, including the repayment of $2 billion of Taiwan secured debt. Combining the debt and equity components, we spent about $1.3 billion for redeemed convertible notes during fiscal fourth quarter. Our convert redemptions in fiscal third and fourth quarter have lowered the share count in the first quarter by approximately 31 million or 2.5% from what it would have been had the converts not been redeemed. Prior to turning to our outlook, I wanted to provide some context for our fiscal first quarter guidance. As Sanjay indicated, our markets remain healthy and demand from our customers is strong, but we are seeing some impact of CPU shortages in the client compute market and limited inventory adjustments at select customers. We expect gross margins to remain very healthy in the fiscal first quarter, although lower than fourth quarter levels, and our gross margins will also be impacted in the near-term, by the announced 10% tariff on $200 billion of imports from China, which will go into effect on September 24th. We are working to gradually mitigate most of the impact from these tariffs over the next three to four quarters. Our fiscal 2019 tax rate should increase to approximately 12% versus 2.8% in fiscal 2018 with the new U.S. corporate tax rules enacted this year. With the revenue, gross margin, and tax factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for the first fiscal quarter is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $7.9 billion to $8.3 billion; gross margins to be in the range of 57% to 60%; operating expenses are expected to be $750 million, plus or minus $25 million; and based on a share count of approximately 1.2 billion fully diluted shares, we expect earnings per share to be $2.95, plus or minus $0.07. Now, let me take a moment to provide an update on our share repurchase program. I’m pleased to report that our buyback has been in effect since the beginning of September and for the fiscal first quarter, we are committed to spend at least $1.5 billion in programmatic repurchases, with an additional amount allocated for opportunistic repurchases. Beyond the first fiscal quarter, we expect to be active buyers of our stock by repurchasing Micron shares regularly. We are committed to deploying at least 50% of our ongoing free cash flow towards our $10 billion buyback program, and as Sanjay mentioned, we are assessing an accelerated rate of completion of this program. The total buyback program of $10 billion represents approximately 19% of the current equity value. Before I turn the call back over to Sanjay, I would like to discuss an update to our disclosures. As we typically do this time of year, we review the financial information we disclose to make sure that we are appropriately balancing the needs of investors to make an informed investment decision, with the desire to keep confidential, as much proprietary information as possible. In doing so, we also review information disclosed by competitors. As a result, beginning in the fiscal first quarter, we will no longer be disclosing gross margins by our DRAM and NAND product categories. We view this information as sensitive and proprietary. To help investors understand the drivers of our corporate gross margins, we will provide color on factors affecting gross margins. We will continue to provide revenue and operating margin information by segment in our quarterly and annual filings with the SEC. With that I’ll now turn the call back over to Sanjay for concluding remarks.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Dave. I am proud of the Micron team’s execution in fiscal 2018. In October, we will celebrate the 40th anniversary of Micron’s founding. Our proven track record in delivering technology and design innovation, and building close partnerships with a broad range of customers, has laid a solid foundation. We are now driving a culture of agility, efficiency, and speed, and executing on product-level innovations in high-value solutions. This transformation to the new Micron continues to build strong momentum. I am really excited about our future, and the best is yet to come. We’ll now open for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Pitzer: Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the solid execution for the fiscal fourth quarter. Dave, I’m wondering, if you could just help us understand the magnitude of the impact in the fiscal first quarter to the CPU shortages and just sort of the modest inventory correction you’re seeing with some of your customers? And specifically, on the CPU shortages, do you feel like that something that’s limited to the fiscal first quarter or are you -- should we think about that persisting into the fiscal second quarter?
Dave Zinsner: Okay. Yes, sure. So, let me take the first one to start with. So, on the magnitude side, we’re not going to go into necessarily the details, all the details in a granular fashion. Suffice it to say that they both had an impact in terms of the guidance of 7.9 and 8.3. They are a big driver of obviously, why we guided in that direction. I don’t know exactly how long the CPU shortage will last. I think on the inventory correction side, it will be a couple of quarters before inventory gets reduced.
Sanjay Mehrotra: And I would just add that the CPU shortages, we expect it to be short-term; it’s possible that it goes beyond Q1 as well.
John Pitzer: Sanjay, maybe as a follow-up, in your prepared comments, you talked about 2019 being a year of transition for your SSD business as you bring out NVMe products. I’m wondering if you could help us understand what that means from a financial perspective for your SSD business. Do you still expect growth in that business in fiscal year ‘19 and kind of how do we think about profitability as you transition from SATA to NVMe?
Sanjay Mehrotra: As we said, we have gained substantial share in SSCDs, primarily based on SATA SSDs over the course of 2018, our fiscal 2018. And we’re very pleased with the progress we have made there. And of course, market is shifting towards NVMe SSDs, and that’s where the future growth opportunity lies. And we have been working on our NVMe SSD solutions. We plan to introduce our first NVMe solutions later this year. And then, we will be advancing as we said in the client and consumer space, bringing new products into the market in calendar year 2019, and bringing later on enterprise and cloud NVMe SSDs later in the year, in the 2019 year. So, our NVMe SSDs will be ramping up gradually over the course of 2019. Of course, we will continue to maintain a solid share position with SATA SSDs. Overall, I expect that our total shares in SSDs will continue to be flattish in 2019 timeframe. And we expect to resume share growth from 2020 as we complete our NVMe SSDs portfolio. And by completing NVMe SSD portfolio, I mean complete the development of SSDs or get them qualified with our customers and ramp them into production. So, we are very confident about the long-term opportunity for us in SSDs, leveraging our low-cost 64-layer NAND as well as our 96 layered NAND solutions over the course of next few quarters.
Operator: Our next question comes from Romit Shah of Nomura. Your line is open.
Romit Shah: Just in your commentary, and certainly the CapEx paints a fairly positive view of the environment, and certainly more positive Sanjay than what we’ve heard from your largest competitor who appears to be reducing investment and preparing for protracted downturn. So, I guess my first question is, how confident are you that the adjustment you’re seeing is really just a one or two quarter issue?
Sanjay Mehrotra: I think, what’s important to understand is that end-market demand trends for DRAM as well as NAND continue to be strong. I mean, when you look at data center and cloud applications, AI is in the very, very early innings. And the whole cloud growth is in the very early innings as well. We see the DRAM requirements in enterprise and cloud data center application to be growing much faster than the total average DRAM industry demand growth, a CAGR over course of few years of about 30%. Similarly, in mobile applications, DRAM is growing nicely as well as machine learning kind of features, as facial recognition et cetera get implemented in these phones. We are already starting to see 6 to 8 gigabyte, even 10 gigabyte coming in high-end smartphones now. And days are not too far that you’ll even see 12 gigabyte in smartphones. And similarly, on the NAND front, when you look at average capacities increasing in smartphones, you’re seeing now 512 gigabyte smartphones being offered. And again, days of terabyte smartphones are not far away. And certainly with elasticity in NAND, average capacities in client computing applications as well as mobile devices will increase as well as attach rate of SSDs will increase. So, this is important. When you look at these demand trends, we feel very confident about the long-term trajectory. One or two quarters here or there, there can certainly be ebb and flow in terms of demand or supply in the industry. But, the long-term trend is positive. And specific to our CapEx, I’d just point out here that we are being very prudent, very disciplined in managing our CapEx, absolutely focused on profitability and ROI. We have mentioned that our CapEx on cleanroom construction and facility upgrades is increasing by $2 billion compared to last year. And Dave mentioned that it represents about 25% of our total CapEx guidance that we provided. And just as an example of our discipline on CapEx management in NAND. In terms of equipment, CapEx for 2019, our fiscal year 2019 versus 2018, we are actually reducing the CapEx fiscal year 2019 versus 2018. So, we are extremely focused on technology conversions, technology transitions because they are the best way for us to achieve cost competitiveness as well as ROI on our investments. We are not adding wafer starts [ph] where some other competitors may have talked about those in the industry.
Romit Shah: I think a lot of us certainly believe in the strong secular trends that are driving your business. What’s been a little surprising though is just the rate of change in pricing, both in NAND and it seems more recently DRAM. Can you talk a little bit about that? And you mentioned some customer inventory. I’m curious, which segments do you see that elevated? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, I think with respect to the inventory question that you asked, it’s very important to understand that we are not talking about that inventory adjustment in any particular segment. This is with few customers. It is a customer-specific inventory adjustment that we discuss here. And of course, we cannot call out those customers on this call. And with respect to pricing, of course, we do not forecast pricing, but you look at our FQ4 results, our DRAM pricing was flat and 71% gross margin, record gross margin, extremely healthy industry environment we see going forward as well for DRAM. As I talked about the demand drivers are vibrant for DRAM, they are diversified and they are secular in nature. And DRAM solutions are really bringing great value to the AI-driven kind of applications where they’re really central to that trend. And you have to keep in mind that the supply growth is slowing down as well, given the increased technology complexity than greater CapEx that is required to implement the technology transition. So, overall, we continue to see healthy DRAM industry fundamentals. On the NAND side, as I mentioned that this year, calendar 2018, we see NAND supply output growth at approximately 45%. And this, as you know, has been there because the industry over the course of last several months has gone through major transition from 2D NAND to 3D NAND with the 64-layer. And the industry at this point is already on 3D transition in terms of total bits, on a calendar year basis at about 75% level. So going forward on NAND as well, as you look at transition in the future to 96-layer, that will have the same kind of consideration that increased technology complexity and reduced bit gain per wafer from 64 to 96-layer transition. So, we see moderation in the industry supply aspect in the first half of 2019.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Amit Daryanani: Thanks a lot, and thanks for taking my question, guys. I guess, two things as well. First, could you just maybe help me understand, when I think about the gross margin guide for fiscal Q1 is down 300 basis points, I think sequentially. How much of that is due to the tariff issue versus what’s going on in memory broadly? And then, as you go through fiscal ‘19, do you think these margins that you can improve throughout the year, especially the results of the tariff issue challenges?
Dave Zinsner: Yes. So, first of all, the gross margin guidance was 57 to 60. So, of course, if we hit the higher end of that range, it would be 140 basis points down. Clearly, tariffs are impacting us, probably to the tune of 50 to 100 basis points. And as we talked about, we’re working on steps to mitigate that. That obviously takes some time. We have to do some things operationally to get ourselves in a place where it isn’t as impactful. And so, it’ll be a quarter or two probably before we start to see some benefit from the improvement there. So, that was certainly a factor on the gross margin side. I would say, in general, the market for DRAM is healthy. The market for NAND is well-supplied. So, here, we’ve built in various expectations, depending on kind of how things play out from a revenue perspective. And that certainly drives some of the gross margin adjustments as well. But suffice it to say, if we look at this from a year-over-year comparison, gross margins, I think, in the first quarter of 2018 were 55.4%, if I’m not mistaken. So, will be above on a year-over-year basis, if we hit within the range of what we expect, anywhere from 160 to 460 basis points.
Amit Daryanani: That’s really helpful, Dave. And I guess, if I could just follow up on NAND side, very specifically pricing has degraded for a couple of months in your data. Obviously, report shows that it has declined as well in the quarter. I think, I am somewhat surprised that you haven’t seen demand elasticity kick-in with output or demand, I guess, improving much more dramatically. So, I’m curious, what do you attribute perhaps to the fact that demand hasn’t stepped up more attractively as pricing has come down? And do you think there’s just a time lag for it to get there? Is it somewhat the reason why we aren’t seeing it?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, let me take that. In terms of demand elasticity, we are certainly seeing that. I think in smartphones you do see a move to higher capacities. I referred to that in my previous same comments [indiscernible] previous question. In SSDs particularly related to consumer and channels related to SSD with the benefit of lower priced NAND, certainly, you’re starting to see -- there is already some lag, average capacity increase in those channels as well. So, overall, NAND definitely continues to benefit from price elasticity.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri of UBS. Your line is open.
Tim Arcuri: Thank you. I had two. So, Sanjay, first, I wanted to see, if you can provide some color sort of in terms of your reduction in costs for DRAM in fiscal 2019, and whether you think it’d be similar to what you reduce cost in DRAM in fiscal 2018?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, we’re not going to provide full year guidance on the cost side for fiscal year ‘19. But, I will tell you that we believe we are in very good position with respect to continuing to execute on our technology and manufacturing roadmap and realizing cost reduction. Of course, as we have said before, when you go from one technology node to the other technology node you achieve less bits per wafer gain, and that impacts of course the cost reduction capability from one node to the next node. And again, the laws of physics are same everywhere, and this is common across the industry, as we discussed at our Investor Day. So 1Y technology, in mature yields will provide less cost reduction than 1X technology provided over the 20-nanometer. Nonetheless, our position will be good in terms of cost reductions. Same things we discussed at Investor Day. We feel very good about our ongoing march towards strengthening our costs competitiveness. And of course, in NAND, we’re in very good position. In NAND, we are in very good position with the lowest cost technology in the industry.
Tim Arcuri: Awesome. Thank you. And then, I had a question on the fiscal 2019 CapEx. So, Samsung is pretty significantly -- well, not just them but both of your peers are pretty significantly reducing DRAM CapEx next year. And it sounds like, if I strip out the infrastructure and the building portion that your equipment spending on DRAM is going to go up next year. So, I’m asking about the juxtaposition of you increasing your DRAM CapEx when your peers are pretty heavily cutting DRAM CapEx next year. So, I wanted you to talk about that dynamic. And specifically, what it would take for you to cut DRAM CapEx next year? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, let me just point out that in 2018, we were well below the industry in terms of overall CapEx. And overall, we definitely are absolutely focused on technology transitions with respect to our CapEx. And we believe we have really a prudent, disciplined focus, as I said before, in terms of adjusting our CapEx toward equipment, targeting it toward technology transitions and big growth coming from the technology transition. We have mentioned that calendar year ‘19, we see our supply and bit growth in line with the industry on DRAM side, which we expect to be approximately 20%. And in NAND, we have said that we expect our fiscal year 2019 supply output bit growth to be -- industry to be in the range of 35% to 40% and for us to be somewhat higher.
Dave Zinsner: And I would say, as we’ve talked about in prepared remarks, we do react to changes in our view and we did reduce our CapEx plans for NAND in fiscal 2019. So, we are able to make adjustments, as we see changes. 
Sanjay Mehrotra: Yes. And of course, we retain some flexibility in terms of managing this on an ongoing basis as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Your question, please?
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thank you for taking the questions. Two, if I can as well. Kind of building on that last question. As we think about what you said about 96-layer an less of an incremental capacity increase when compared to that of 64-layer. I’m wondering if you could provide us some framework of how we should think about the next phase of transitions in NAND in terms of bit output, increases on a per wafer perspective? And then, I have a quick follow-up.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, at this point, we are not providing specifics on 96-layer that how much you gain per wafer. But, I think some of it can be obvious as well. You are going from 64-layer to 96 layers. Future generations beyond 96-layer will tend to have, again reduce bit gain per wafer. All of that is obviously along with the assumptions of industry ramp of 96-layer is baked into our overall guidance of fiscal year -- calendar year ‘19 NAND bit growth of 35% to 40%. It’s slowing down because again 64-layer to 96-layer will give you less gain. So, in 2018, you saw a onetime increase in NAND bit growth that the industry went from 2D to 3D transition with 64-layer. Going forward, it will revert back to the same curve of less and less bit gain, and of course, more CapEx requirements with each successful technology transition.
Aaron Rakers: Okay, fair enough. As a quick follow-up, I’m curious, you talked a little bit earlier about your NVMe positioning and the portfolio expansion. You didn’t talk much about quad level cell or QLC. So, maybe if you can update us of where you see that positioned and when we should expect to see that kind of impacting the SSD business, as we look through 2019 or into 2020?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, in my prepared remarks, I did mention about our QLC. And we have -- we are the first ones to introduce QLC SSDs in the industry, very proud of Micron’s ability and execution in that area and very proud of our team to be able to do that. And we have just begun with certain set of limited customers, taking that QLC SATA SSD product to the market. This will be growing revenue for us within SSD next year. Although it will remain relatively small, it will initially be of course, in the SATA QLC solutions. As in the past, when you went through MLC transitions in the NAND industry or you went through the TLC transitions in the NAND industry, those transitions occurred over a course of a few years. And we similarly expect that QLC transition to be happening gradually over the course of next few years, although we will start realizing revenue from QLC SSDs starting now, but, then continuing to increase it modestly in calendar 2019 as well.
Aaron Rakers: Okay. Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: And of course focusing on it in the SSD space.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur of JP Morgan. Your question, please?
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon, guys. Great job on the quarterly execution. On the inventory adjustments, is this primarily client side or data center side? And is this a statement more about just kind of higher cumulated inventories in the first half or is this a statement around the overall demand environment coming in less than expected or a combination of both?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, as I said before, this is not limited to any particular segment. It is more specific customer consideration. And, given the kind of pricing that had existed in the DRAM market, certain customers had certain inventory levels that -- certain inventory strategies that they were pursuing, and those customers have decided to adjust their inventory levels. So, that’s what we refer to in our remarks. In terms of the end market demand for those customers and end market demand for DRAM applications, that continues to be solid. It’s just an inventory adjustment approach of some of our customers.
Harlan Sur: Great. Thanks for the insights there. And you guys have done a great job of improving the NAND mix. I mean, your margins actually went up in the quarter. Given the strong cloud spending trends, you obviously have a great mix of enterprise and cloud SATA products. The transition to NVMe is going to be slower than expected. So, I would anticipate your SATA products continue to do well. So, on a go forward basis and given your customer spending trends, do you guys anticipate continued mix base improvements in benefits in your NAND business from a gross margin perspective?
Sanjay Mehrotra: I mean, absolutely, we will continue to increase our high-value solutions mix, which means SSDs, as well as managed NAND solutions for mobile applications including discrete managed NAND solutions, as well as multichip packages where, of course, we have a significant benefit, because we have both, DRAM and NAND. So absolutely, this is part of our strategy. We will absolutely continue to increase our mix of SSD and managed NAND solutions, high-value solutions. Just want to remind you that we had shared at the Investor Day that in fiscal year ‘17 we had about 40% of NAND revenue coming from our high-value solutions; that means SSDs and managed NAND solutions. And in fiscal year ‘18, we increased that to little over 60%. In fact, in fiscal Q4, our managed NAND and SSD mix, the high-value solutions mix in NAND is over two-thirds. So, this just goes to show you that we are absolutely working towards our goals that we had shared with you at the Investor Day that by 2021 we will have 80% of our NAND revenue in terms of -- actually in terms of managed NAND solutions. So, this is going really well for us and it of course, provides us the benefits in terms of profitability as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thank you. Two quick questions. Sanjay, have been referencing visibility on to data center. And this is something that I think investment community would really appreciate. If you could give us the thought process that gives you the confidence, and what are the key metrics that gives you the visibility? Anything here there that could be specific would be really great. And I have a follow-up.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, certainly, I think when you look at the data center, the total CapEx increases, particularly in the hyperscale application, a lot of that CapEx it does go toward server and memory and storage applications. So, that certainly is an indication of the continuing year-over-year growth in that area and certainly in integration of increasing opportunity. But, again, I’ll point out that we are in very early innings there. And this is going to be a multi-year growth opportunity for us. And we are extremely focused on working closely with the customers in this space. And through those discussions, we get good visibility from them in terms of our opportunity for the future. So, we feel very good about our growth opportunities in this part of the segment here.
Mehdi Hosseini: Sure. I absolutely agree with you. And I think your Analyst Day provided a lot of detail and informative information and how the opportunities could be. I think, what we’re struggling with is, how to model this is, just not on a quarterly basis, maybe on a six-month basis. Because perhaps opportunities by 2020, 2021 are enormous, but what happens in 2019? And how should we think about cloud CapEx? In the past, we had PC units and we had content. We had the smartphone units and the content. But now the cloud, either an internet or a software company provide cloud services, it’s very difficult to model this. And we have to think about how ‘19 will look like before all of these opportunities would materialize. And I was just wondering if there is anything you can share with us to help us with the thought process.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, I think one of the things I will share with you is that if you look at the DRAM demand growth projections in the cloud and in enterprise datacenter space, you will see that that CAGR over few years is 30%. And that is higher than the expected DRAM overall industry supply bit growth of 20%. So, this is one of the fastest growth areas, where DRAM along with NAND, really bring lot of value to those customers. I think at our Investor Day we had taken you through the details of how AI driven applications are requiring 6 times more DRAM per servers and 2 times more SSDs per server. So, I think you have to look at all of these trends. There is no one particular trend that I can point to you in this regard. Of course, you have to look at the cloud CapEx, you have to look at the average capacity increases that are taking place on the DRAM side as well as for the NAND side in cloud applications, the server attach rates. The CPUs that are going into the servers have more memory channels that’s enabling more DRAM growth per server content in the data center application. So, there are many of these things that all absolutely are pointing to strong demand drivers. And just to end the comment here, I would point out that our end market applications are well-diversified in DRAM. Of course, cloud and data center is one strong growth area for us, but mobile, automotive, industrial, IoT, all of these are also growth applications. For example, in automotive and industrial, we have number one market share, and that’s a very stable kind of market opportunity. And we are doing very well. Graphics is another example, right. But we have very strong position in graphics as well, and another growth opportunity. So, multiple growth drivers and we are well-positioned. The message is, the industry is structurally different and Micron -- the New Micron is also structurally different. And we are well-positioned to drive the business going forward.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. And if I may, just have quickly one for David. How should we think about your NAND and DRAM or aggregate inventory, either number of days or how it has changed sequentially?
Dave Zinsner: Well, inventory in total is probably you’re breaking out, which inventory on a days’ basis right now is in kind of the high-90s; it’s been that way for some time now. I would say we’re comfortable with our inventory position. Having said that, if you remember, in the Analyst Day, Manish, runs operations, talked about some of the things he was doing to improve the efficiency of the manufacturing group, and on top of that, improve, in particular the back end and try them to make that more streamlined. And there is a whole bunch of things we’re doing in terms of system improvements and process improvement that I think will actually have a pretty good effect on inventory going forward. So, over time, I think you’ll see us carry lower days of inventory and improved working capital in the process.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question for the session comes from C.J. Muse of Evercore. Your line is open.
C.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for squeezing me in. If I could ask two. First one, on the call, you talked about moderating NAND supply in the first half of ‘19. Curious with the construct of inventory adjustment at a few of your customers, could you kind of walk through how you’re seeing DRAM supply-demand, particularly as you also layer in some of the cuts that we’ve seen from the your two other competitors in terms of equipment add over the last 6 to 9 months?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, as we mentioned, we see DRAM to be healthy in Q1. And we definitely see healthy demand supply trend for DRAM beyond that as well, given the well diversified growth drivers for DRAM. So, overall, we see DRAM in balance. And regarding the inventory adjustment, I just want to be clear that that comment is related to DRAM.
C.J. Muse: Okay. Very helpful. And then, as my follow-up on the buybacks, you talked about $1.5 billion or roughly 3% of the Company. I’m curious, given you have the 10b5 program in place, September 1st, should that be front end loaded, thus more material benefit as we go through this quarter and next? And then also, considering you’re now, I think $2.5 billion plus or minus net cash position, at these prices, would you consider being even more aggressive? Thank you.
Dave Zinsner: Good question, C.J. And I do want to thank investors for being patient with us a little bit. We announced this in May at the Analyst Day, and we needed a few more months to get the balance sheet to where we wanted. As you mentioned, now, we have a great net cash position, we have debt now below $5 billion that 0.3 times EBITDA. And we have great liquidity. We’re now over $9 billion of liquidity. And we said we wanted to be 30% of sales and liquidity. So, we’re in a very strong position in entering fiscal 2019, which I think is great. Our intention is to be fairly programmatic about the buyback. And so, that $1.5 billion does represent more of a programmatic type approach. Having said that, we did mention that we have layered on top of that some opportunistic repurchases, and so, that will be somewhat timing based -- based on when the opportunities arise to take advantage of buying back a little bit more. In both Sanjay and my prepared remarks, we did talk about acceleration. And if you look at the $1.5 billion and kind of make some estimations around our free cash flow for the first quarter, you’ll probably get a figure that is above 50% free cash number we said we are committed to. So, I think it is in the cards for us to be a little bit more aggressive over time. And we obviously think that this is a fantastic price to be buying the stock at.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may disconnect at this time.

Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Shanye. Good afternoon, everyone. Micron continues to perform exceptionally well, achieving record revenue and profitability and generating strong operating cash flow in the third quarter. Our focus on structural improvements and consistent execution is driving improved financial performance. First, we are accelerating advanced technology development and rapidly deploying it into production to meet our supply growth and product cost reduction targets. Second, we are broadening our portfolio of high-value solutions to drive increased profitability and strengthen our customer relationships. And third, we announced a capital return program to repurchase up to $10 billion of our shares outstanding starting in fiscal 2019. These initiatives underscore our commitment to enhancing long-term shareholder value. Turning to our businesses, we delivered strong results across the breadth of our end markets. We were particularly pleased with our mobile business, where we increased revenue by 12% sequentially, setting a new Company record. Revenue from high-value mobile NAND nearly doubled quarter-over-quarter, enabled by the ramp of eMMC and eMCP products to multiple smartphone OEMs. 85% of Managed NAND gigabytes that we shipped in FQ3 were lower-cost TLC NAND, as compared to virtually no TLC NAND just one year ago. Memory and storage content per phone continues to rise, creating ongoing demand for our mobile solutions. We are strategically shaping our mobile portfolio to put us in the best competitive position, including the production launch of our 1Y nanometer low-power DDR4 memory and several new 64-layer TLC UFS and eMCP Managed NAND solutions, all later this year. Data center trends are also driving momentum for Micron’s DRAM and NAND solutions, with combined revenue up 87% year-over-year. In the third quarter, ongoing demand for our memory and storage solutions in cloud computing was a key highlight. Our DRAM and NAND revenue from cloud customers increased sequentially by 33% and 24%, respectively. This performance was enabled by our improving execution, ability to expand share, and strengthening relationships with key customers in this rapidly growing segment. We stand to benefit from the significant investments cloud service providers are making to build out their IT infrastructure. Cloud CapEx is expected to be $50 billion in 2018, and as we shared during our investor event, analysts project this CapEx to reach $108 billion by 2021. We achieved record revenue across all market segments of our embedded business, enabled by shifts to higher-value products and continuing healthy demand. Growth was particularly robust in consumer and industrial markets, driven by trends in home and industrial automation, drones, and IoT. We completed qualification of a 64-layer 3D NAND surveillance-grade microSD card, which is designed for smart surveillance deployments that move AI capabilities to edge devices. We also had notable design-in activity on low-power automotive DRAM and see growing opportunities in the near term for our portfolio of infotainment, dashboard, and ADAS solutions. We readied multiple new products for customer qualification this quarter, including the first 1X nanometer low-power automotive DRAM and a GDDR6 solution for ADAS and autonomous applications. These advanced new products extend an industry-leading portfolio of unique automotive and industrial solutions that, coupled with long-term customer relationships, has helped the Embedded Business Unit deliver consistent profitable growth for Micron. Overall, we continue to strengthen our product portfolio as we shift our mix away from components and toward high-value solutions. We are outpacing competitors in the high-value graphics market, and our graphics revenue more than doubled year-over-year. We also set another Company record in overall SSD sales, increasing our revenue by 37% versus a year ago. We began volume production shipments of our 64-layer 3D NAND enterprise SATA SSD and shipped the world’s first QLC-based SSD, a high-capacity drive ideal for read-centric applications like streaming media servers. This QLC SSD is built on our industry-leading 64-layer 3D NAND, utilizing the first-ever terabit NAND die in the industry. As we continue to introduce new SSD solutions on lower-cost, next-generation technologies, we believe that we can unlock new pools of demand that are currently being served by HDDs. Our technology and operational execution continues to pay dividends. As we recently shared, we achieved yield maturity and production output crossover on our 64-layer 3D NAND ahead of schedule. We still expect to have production shipments on our 96-layer 3D NAND in the second half of calendar year 2018. We are also making good progress on the development of our fourth-generation 3D NAND, which will utilize our novel replacement gate technology. In DRAM, we are on track to reach bit crossover on our 1X technology and to begin production shipments on our 1Y technology, both in the second half of calendar year 2018. As we noted at our analyst event, we have a strong product and process roadmap for DRAM with 1Z and 1-alpha development programs already underway. Turning to 3D XPoint technology, as you know, we are partners with Intel in the development and manufacturing of 3D XPoint. As part of that ongoing relationship, we have been discussing the commercial terms of our future-generation 3D XPoint collaboration. Our goal in these discussions is to ensure that Micron has a path to strong ROI for our investments and technology contributions. We will provide updates as appropriate as these discussions progress further. As we highlighted at our investor day, we are excited about the potential for 3D XPoint technology to create a new tier of memory and storage between DRAM and NAND flash. We remain focused on our 3D XPoint product development and are on track to introduce our first products in late calendar 2019, with meaningful revenue in 2020. In summary, we continue to see strong market demand for memory and fast storage products due to the value these solutions provide in an economy where data and fast access to that data is increasingly important. Growing capabilities in the data center have enabled greater functionality at the edge, increasing users and creating more data and, in turn, driving opportunities for expanded, higher-value data services. We believe this virtuous cycle has driven the secular growth patterns we are currently seeing across nearly all of our markets and believe that it will persist into the foreseeable future. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Dave Zinsner, to provide details on our third quarter results and outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2018.
Dave Zinsner: Thank you, Sanjay, and good afternoon, everyone. Micron’s relentless focus on execution is evident in our third quarter results. We set new records for revenue, gross margin, operating income, and earnings per share. In addition, we delivered on our goal of achieving a net cash positive position with our cash balance nearly $350 million above GAAP debt position. We are on the strongest financial footing in the Company’s 40-year history, allowing us to make investments that will capitalize on the secular growth trends driven by the data economy. Our focus on growing high-value solutions, including Managed NAND and low-power DRAM products for the mobile market, SSDs for the cloud market, as well as graphics DRAM, drove our fiscal third quarter results. We also saw the benefit of strong execution on technology transitions. Total revenue was $7.8 billion, up 6% from fiscal second quarter and 40% from the prior year. Non-GAAP gross margins for the period expanded to a record 61%, up 250 basis points from the prior quarter and up from 48% in the prior year. A robust business environment, more favorable mix, and good execution on cost reductions drove significant gross margin expansion. It is important to note that we were able to achieve record gross margins while we continue to incur underloading charges in advance of volume ramp of our 3D XPoint solutions, which will follow product introductions that are targeted for late calendar 2019. We estimate that these charges impacted gross margins by approximately 100 basis points. Our record revenue and gross margin performance drove strong profitability in the third quarter. Operating income grew to $4 billion on a non-GAAP basis, representing 52% of revenue. This compares with operating margins of 49% in fiscal third quarter and 37% in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP operating expenses came in at $733 million, up approximately 10% from fiscal second quarter and in line with our planned investments in technology and product development. Moving forward, we expect to increase our OpEx from the current run rate, particularly for R&D as we continue to accelerate the development of new products and technologies. Now, turning to the performance by business unit. We achieved record revenue for the Compute and Networking Business Unit of $4 billion in the third quarter, up 67% year-over-year and 8% from the prior quarter. Every CNBU business contributed to this growth except the client business, as we directed supply to customers in markets experiencing robust demand. We saw broad-based demand for our memory solutions, with sales of both cloud server and graphics memory products more than doubling year-over-year. Operating income for CNBU increased by 12% sequentially to $2.6 billion or 66% of revenue and more than doubled on a year-over-year basis. Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit increased to a record $1.8 billion, up 12% quarter-over-quarter and 55% year-over-year. We are experiencing ongoing momentum for our Managed NAND products, with multiple customer qualifications underway for our eMCP solutions. We also continue to see healthy demand for our industry-leading low-power DRAM products. The benefits of shifting more of our supply to these high-value mobile products are evident in our profits. Operating income increased to $860 million or 49% percent of revenue, up from $689 million last quarter and $304 million in the year-ago period. The Embedded Business Unit continues to deliver solid results, with record revenue of $897 million, up 8% versus fiscal second quarter and up 28% year-over-year. Growth was driven by demand for consumer and industrial applications, including set-top boxes, factory automation, and industrial drones. ADAS and in-vehicle experience applications supported record automotive sales for the quarter. Fiscal third quarter operating income was $386 million, which translates to a healthy 43% of revenue, roughly flat with the prior quarter and up by 600 basis points from the prior year. And finally, turning to the Storage Business Unit, third quarter revenue was $1.1 billion, which is comprised of SSD, NAND components, and 3D XPoint sales. We continue to build momentum with our SSD portfolio and set a new record for SSD revenue, which now represents over 50% of total SBU revenue. Consistent with our strategy and as we shared at our investor event, we are shifting more of our NAND supply away from components to high-value products such as Managed NAND, which are targeted for our mobile and embedded markets, as well as SSDs. This shift to NAND supply and lower 3D XPoint sales to our partner resulted in a 9% sequential decline in our Storage Business Unit revenue. The underutilization costs associated with 3D XPoint production that I previously mentioned had a negative impact on SBU operating margins of approximately 700 basis points in the third quarter. Our resulting SBU operating income was $156 million or 14% of third quarter revenue, compared with 20% in fiscal second quarter. Today, a majority of our SSD sales are based on 32-layer 3D NAND. As Sanjay pointed out earlier, we are starting to ramp SSD solutions built on our 64-layer 3D NAND, initially targeting consumer and cloud customers. Our SBU cost structure will benefit from this transition to lower-cost 64-layer SSDs. Moving to performance by product line, DRAM represented 71% of total Company revenue in fiscal third quarter. DRAM revenue was up 6% from the prior quarter and 56% year-over-year, reflecting strong execution on our strategy and a robust market environment. ASPs increased in the mid-to-upper single digit percentage range, supported by broad-based demand and a richer mix of high-value sales, including server and graphics DRAM products. Shipment quantities were relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. And our resulting non-GAAP gross margin was 69%, up from 66% in fiscal second quarter and 54% from the year-ago quarter. We achieved $1.9 billion in trade NAND revenue, representing 25% of total Company revenue for the fiscal third quarter. Trade NAND revenue was up 8% quarter-over-quarter and 14% year-over-year, reflecting healthy demand for our products. While on a like-for-like basis, NAND pricing declined modestly sequentially, our overall NAND ASP increased in the mid-to-upper single-digit percentage range, driven by a richer mix of high-value solutions in our NAND portfolio. We ramped eMCP solutions to our mobile customers, which tend to carry higher ASPs relative to other NAND products. Trade NAND shipment quantities remained relatively flat compared to the prior quarter. And trade NAND gross margins were 47% on a non-GAAP basis, up 50 basis points from the prior quarter and up 600 basis points from the year-ago quarter. Our solid execution and healthy industry environment led to record non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.15, up 12% from the prior quarter and 94% from the prior year. We generated $4.3 billion in cash from operations, representing 55% of revenue. Capital spending, net of third-party contributions, was $2.1 billion in the third quarter. We expect the full fiscal year 2018 CapEx to be approximately $8 billion, which includes previously discussed investments associated with our cleanroom expansions in Singapore and Hiroshima. Our resulting free cash flow was $2.2 billion, flat with the prior quarter and nearly double that of the year ago period. We ended the quarter in a net cash positive position with approximately $7.7 billion in cash, marketable investments, and restricted cash, and $7.3 billion in GAAP debt, including approximately $300 million of incremental debt incurred in third quarter by our jointly owned 3D XPoint fab. We are very pleased to have achieved a net cash positive position one quarter earlier than we had originally committed. We reduced our gross debt position by approximately $2 billion in FQ3, and we expect to reduce our debt by another $2 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter. We also used $1.1 billion in cash in the third quarter to settle the debt and equity components of our convertible notes. In addition, we received another $550 million of convertible note redemptions in the third quarter, which we will cash settle early in the fourth quarter. Combined, these convert notices equate to roughly a 20 million share count reduction. This is a great start to our strategy of reducing our fully diluted share count, which we expect will continue in fiscal 2019, when we begin utilizing at least 50% of our annual free cash flow to repurchase shares under our $10 billion share repurchase authorization. Turning to non-GAAP guidance for the fourth fiscal quarter. The market for our products continues to be robust, and we are executing well on our strategy. We therefore expect sequential revenue growth again in the fourth quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $8 billion to $8.4 billion; gross margins to be in the range of 59% to 62%. Operating expenses are expected to be $750 million, plus or minus $25 million. And based on a share count of approximately 1.23 billion shares, these results should drive EPS of $3.30, plus or minus $0.07. I’ll now turn the call over to Sanjay for some concluding remarks.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Dave. We recently introduced our vision for the New Micron. We have been undergoing a fundamental transformation, driven by changes in our markets, our industry, and within our Company. Starting with our markets, data-hungry applications are driving secular growth for memory and storage solutions. Importantly, our customers recognize the essential added value that memory and fast storage provide for the solutions they deliver to their end customers. Second, the industry we operate within is structurally different than in the past. Technology transitions require more CapEx and provide less bit gain, and the pace of those transitions has slowed, given increased process complexities. The result is a more consistent and stable supply-demand outlook. These structural changes have also resulted in improved ROI over the last several years. Finally, a laser-sharp focus on executing our strategic business objectives has allowed Micron to better capitalize on our excellent technology portfolio, product breadth, manufacturing scale, customer reach, and deep team expertise. We are creating a culture of increased urgency, crisp execution, and accountability that will enable us to consistently deliver against these strategic objectives and create positive results for all stakeholders. We will now open for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from line of Romit Shah with Nomura. Your line is now open.
Romit Shah: Okay, thanks. And thanks for leaving the guidance at the end of the presentation that really kept us on our seat here. Great results. I had a question about NAND pricing. The like-for-like pricing, you mentioned in NAND was down modestly. And based on guidance, it seems like the NAND business as well as DRAM will be healthy again in August. There has been, I would say several reports about your largest competitors seeing significant ASP weakness in their NAND business. And I’m just having a hard time trying to reconcile why Micron isn’t seeing this weakness as well.
Dave Zinsner: Yes. I think, I won’t comment on the fourth quarter guidance and what’s built into it. But, I think right now what you’re seeing is a pretty healthy mix of the higher value solutions. We’re getting increasingly a higher mix of that component into our NAND -- into our NAND business. And that’s really helping keep the pricing healthy.
Romit Shah: You did say though that even absent mix that seems like NAND pricing was down far less than it was in the prior quarter. Correct?
Dave Zinsner: Yes.
Romit Shah: Okay. So, again, kind of the same question. How do we reconcile the performance that the NAND business and pricing like-for-like it seems like the ASP declines are fairly modest with what seems to be bigger and broader weakness from some of your competitors?
Dave Zinsner: Well, I think, in one case, in the second quarter when you look at the pricing, there was a bit of an aberration, I guess I’d call it, given that we had in the first quarter a higher ASP lift as it related to kind of onetime MLC sales. So, actually think when you strip that out, if we had done it like-for-like. I don’t think we made a comment on that in the second quarter. You would have found that those ASP declines were relatively modest as well.
Romit Shah: Okay. And if I could just follow up…
Sanjay Mehrotra: I just want to point out that as Dave said in his remarks that the mix of our NAND business has improved substantially, given successful execution on our strategy of shifting our products toward high value solutions. And multichip packages which have both NAND and DRAM and carry higher ASPs, on a sequential basis, we doubled our sales of those solutions in the market. And of course we did well on SSD as well, which hit a record. So, all that mix really drove our strong performance on the ASP front for the NAND business.
Romit Shah: Okay, great. And then, just as a follow-up, I noticed for both DRAM and NAND, there really wasn’t much bit growth for each of those businesses. Are you still comfortable with your bit growth targets for both DRAM and NAND for calendar ‘18? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Yes. We are comfortable with our targets. As we said, we are proceeding well with our 64-layer transition into production, actually achieved bit output crossover one quarter earlier than planned, and on the DRAM side continued to do well with our 1X nanometer technology transition, which we said will have bit output crossover by the end of the calendar year, and similarly good progress in terms of our 1Y nanometer DRAM. So, yes, with respect to our overall bit growth target for the year as we have said that we believe that the industry will be in the range of 40% to 45% for NAND and will be somewhat higher, that remains the case. And with respect to DRAM, we have said in calendar year 2018, industry supply bit growth will be approximately 20% and will be in range and that stays the same as well. I’ll just point out that in FQ3, our -- the supply -- the shipment growth being flat for DRAM and NAND, as you were questioning that really is just related to the normal ebb and flow of the business in terms of qualifications of our products in those new technology nodes as well as ramp up in production of those technologies.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of C.J. Muse of Evercore. Your line is now open.
C.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question on gross margins and if we take the midpoint down just a smidge Q-on-Q. So, curious, should we be thinking about changes to mix on both DRAM and NAND as driving that or perhaps a slowdown in cost down, given some of the challenges ahead with 64, 96, 1Y et cetera? I would love to hear your thoughts on that.
Dave Zinsner: Yes. Well, we probably won’t get into too much detail about our guidance, other than to say we did give a range, the high end of the range is 62%, so that would actually be an improvement from this quarter. So, that’s certainly a scenario and that would encompass a more robust mix of higher margin products for sure. And this is somewhat mix dependent business. And so, we factor in that that might happen and that creates a bit of a range for us. I wouldn’t look too much into the fact that the midpoint is slightly below.
C.J. Muse: Okay. I was just trying to get more color on the mix. So, thanks for that. I guess, larger picture question for DRAM, in the last few months we’ve heard about real-time push-outs of select capacity, which I think is the first when the industry is enjoying such margins, as you are today. So, I guess, can you speak to I guess this new rational profitability focused market and would love to hear kind of your thoughts for the market today and into year-end and beyond?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, we just said that at length at our investor day and as we highlighted, the markets today are structurally different compared to ever in the past. For us, they’re ever more diversified. Markets are not just about DC and DRAM. I mean, data center is driving large growth for DRAM. The AI trends, which we are very, very early innings of requires more and more DRAM in order to really perform high performance competition that AI applications rely on. So, driving -- AI applications are driving growth in the data center as well as through more intelligent devices on the edge. And smartphones, certainly where features such as AR and VR and AI getting implemented into these phones, along with all the high resolutions cameras, they require more and more DRAM as well. So, the demand drivers are diverse. They’re secular in the nature. Memory has become essential in terms of delivering the value proposition of the end market applications. So, this is what is really driving the overall robust demand drivers for our industry for DRAM. And whether it’s in data centers or in mobile or in graphics or automotive applications, all of these need more memory. And memory is now really enabling higher value as well to the end market applications. So, yes, this all bodes well for the long-term healthy industry fundamentals. And all of this reflects in our guidance as well, which speaks for itself. It’s a very robust strong guidance that we have provided for the third quarter.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John Pitzer: Dave, I guess, my first question just revolves around the profitability levels in the SBU. Just kind of curious, when you think about underutilization charges for XPoint, have those now peaked on sort of a quarterly basis or how should we think about that? And you mentioned in your prepared comments that the move from 32 to 64 should help profitability there. I guess, just as we think longer term, notwithstanding what you’re selling to Intel at sort of cost, how do we think about the long-term operating margin trajectory of this business compared to your other business units?
Dave Zinsner: So, just going back to the prepared remarks, the underutilization charge associated with 3D XPoint was about 700 basis points, as it hit to the SBU operating margins. We sold very little of 3D XPoint to our partner. And so, it certainly was a relatively high level. Hard to say, if this is indeed the peak, but it’s certainly close to the peak if not the peak. I think, longer term from underutilization perspective, we could continue to sell wafers to our partner, and that certainly would mitigate the underutilization charges. So, I wouldn’t dismiss the likelihood of that happening. And then, on top of that, as Sanjay mentioned earlier in the call, we are expecting 3D XPoint products towards the end of calendar year 2019 and will ramp into 2020. And that certainly will help improve the underutilization aspect of this thing, and have that go away. Having said that, we are looking to try to improve the cost structure of the storage business unit; and certainly as we transition more and more of the wafers from 32-layer to 64-layer, that will have a meaningful improvement to the cost structure of SBU.
Sanjay Mehrotra: And I’ll just point out that it’s only a very short period of time, just a few quarters. So, we eventually we have really driven tremendous momentum in our SSD sales and SBU. And yes, they are mostly 32-layer driven but 64-layer is starting to ramp. And as we focus on bringing our next generation of products into the market with our -- such NVMe solutions as well as more 64-layer based solutions for cloud applications, that will help improve the cost structure and certainly will bode well for the health of our SBU business going forward. So, we are very excited about the opportunities, about our very cost-effective NAND die and technology, and very focused on continuing to accelerate our product introductions and get the benefit of advanced technology nodes as well as the reduce the overall cost of SSD builds, because you know that in SSDs, there is more than just memory that goes into building SSD. So, we are extremely focused on all of those. And that bodes well for the cost structure of our SSD solutions as well as growth of the SSD business.
John Pitzer: And then, Sanjay as my follow-up, I know that you guys have sort of rightfully tried to get away from giving us quarterly bit growth and cost down projections for DRAM and NAND. But, I wonder more generically, as you think about for DRAM, the transition to 1X and NAND, the transition to 64 layers, which quarter do you think you are going to get the maximum benefit? Is there more of a benefit in the August quarter or is it more of the November quarter? How should we think about that for both DRAM and NAND?
Sanjay Mehrotra: In terms of cost, we are continuing to ramp our -- in DRAM, our 1X technology into production. And as we said in the latter half of this year, we will achieve the bit crossover. And then that 1X technology node will continue to ramp into production even during the course of next year, just like our 20-nanometer ramp for several quarters as well. So, that will on an ongoing basis continue to provide us cost benefits. And same story on the NAND side. We are focused on continuing to go beyond bit crossover, the 64-layer now, to continue to increase the mix of 64-layer technology to production. And then, as we ready our 96-layer technology, which in my prepared remarks I said, we will be having in the second half of this year, as we ramp that up, it will then continue to provide additional cost benefits on an ongoing basis. So, you really can’t say, which quarter is the cost reduction peaking. In general this is gradual over the course of future quarters. And please do not forget, when I’m talking about NAND here, I’m talking about the NAND technology level cost reduction capabilities. Of course NAND cost is also a function of mix. I mean MCP solutions tend to carry the cost of the DRAM in them as well. So, they tend to be highest cost when you measure it as a cost per gigabyte of NAND and similarly SSD solutions because they have other cost, also tend to be higher cost. So, don’t confuse the reported cost changes quarter-over-quarter with the underlying technology capability of cost reduction. The mix plays the role in reported margin numbers that you talk about.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. 
Joe Moore: I wonder if you could talk about the capital spending. You talked about the low 30s as a percentage of sales. Obviously, sales are coming in lot better than at least I expected this year, and you’ll be in the sort of high 20s. So, low 30s comments mean you think your sort of spending less than you want this year and just any indications you can give us on what that means for next year?
Dave Zinsner: I mean, the low 30s is more of a longer-term model. Clearly, some years will be under the low 30s, some years we might be a little bit above the low 30s. This is a very robust year from a revenue perspective. And we had a plan where we wanted to make investments, both in DRAM and NAND, plus cleanroom space we talked about in Hiroshima and Singapore, and then also some investments, capital investments in our R&D organization. And so, I think the fact that we had a bit more revenue and we had an opportunity to make some more investments, we did take advantage of that this year. But clearly, it’s below our model. I’d tell you next year, which I’m assuming Joe is real source of your question is try to figure out what next year might look like. I don’t know the exact number yet. I mean, we’re still working up the operating plan for next year. I think Sanjay in his discussions with all of you at the analyst day made a great point about the capital intensity of these businesses going up, which is why we thought the low 30s as a percent of revenue made sense. And so, I think if you wanted to make a guess, you certainly suggest the CapEx will be up next year. The magnitude of that and exactly how that would all break down, I think is yet to be determined by us. And we will go through the process this quarter in a very granular fashion, make sure we’re getting good ROI on everything, every dollar we put into CapEx. And then, I think at the end of the fourth quarter when we’re providing guidance, we’ll give you a specific number in terms of CapEx.
Joe Moore: Okay. That’s helpful. Thank you. And then, I wonder if you can -- there has been a bunch written about antitrust concerns here. It is not obvious to me that there would be any. I’m just wondering if you can provide any context around those articles or those things.
Sanjay Mehrotra: We can’t really comment much on it, other than the authorities in China had visited our offices and had on May 31, I believe it was, and had requested certain information. And of course we are cooperating with that. And I would just like to point out that we absolutely do remain focused on -- disciplined and operating with highest integrity methods.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Blayne Curtis: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was just curious, in DRAM, you saw nice uplift in ASPs. I think, you’ve seen the pricing in the market, or at least it was swapped, pricing come down. I was curious, little more color on that mix that helped you there. I think you mentioned servers and graphics, just curious your outlook for those segments as you look into the second half of the calendar year.
Sanjay Mehrotra: I think, servers and graphics, we continue to see growth, strong growth in those areas. And again, these are long-term trends. As we described earlier that cloud and all the billions of devices on the edge, all of them becoming more intelligent and trends of AI are absolutely driving more and more demand. We had shared at the investor day, for example AI driven, AI training driven compute workloads have like 2x the amount of DRAM and 6x the amount of SSD. So, these trends are really secular in nature. We are at the very, very beginning. And same way in mobile in terms of our low power DRAM where we have very strong position, DRAM contents requirements are going -- continuing to increase. And certainly graphics in console and gaming as well as some crypto driven demand continues to be overall long term strong trend as well.
Blayne Curtis: Thanks. And then, maybe just a question for Dave, I just wanted maybe a clarification, just on the NAND. ASPs were up with mix. It looks like costs were up. And I just wanted to make sure is that just a function of selling more higher value parts and modules and such, just curious.
Dave Zinsner: Yes. You’re right. Sanjay even mentioned that the mix of multichip products in the mobile was very healthy this quarter and they do have a NAND and a DRAM component. Their ASPs are very high. They’re margin accretive, I would point out, but the cost is actually higher. So, the cost and ASPs did go up. But it did expand the margins on the NAND side by about 50 basis points.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie. Your line is now open.
Srini Pajjuri: Thank you. And let me echo my congrats as well. I guess, Sanjay, just a quick question on the server demand that you talked about. You said data center DRAM and NAND grew 87%. I can see why the NAND business is outgrowing the market, but I’m just curious, you seem to be outgrowing DRAM overall server demand, server market as well. So, I’m just curious as to what’s driving those share gains, if you can comment on that. Then, I have a follow-up.
Sanjay Mehrotra: I think our strong execution with our products is enabling us to really broaden and deepen our reach with our cloud customers. And over the course of last few quarters, in cloud where we used to be under represented with respect to our total shares, when you look at our total share of the DRAM industry and you look at cloud, we used to be under represented but with strengthening execution, our share has increased and is in line with rest of the overall DRAM industry share. So, it is really sheer execution on our product roadmap, our ability to work closely with those customers to understand the requirements in terms of the technology, in terms of the product and certainly understanding them in terms of supply as well and being able to fulfill their requirement successfully. This is an important area of focus for us. And I am very pleased with the performance of the Company, both on the DRAM side as well as on the NAND side in this growth market.
Srini Pajjuri: And then, maybe for Dave. Dave, on the CapEx, the low 30% CapEx guidance that you talked about, you talked about expanding cleanroom, both in NAND as well as in DRAM. I believe it was 10% in DRAM and 35% in NAND. I guess, if you assume that the NAND and DRAM bit growth will sustain at the current levels when do you think you’ll need more cleanroom space? And whenever that is, what are the implications for the CapEx?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Difficult to predict when we would need additional cleanroom space. Obviously these node transitions are requiring more footprint, more floor space as we move increasingly to more and more higher technologies. And so, I am not sure I could predict exactly when we’ll need that. What we’re trying to do is carefully build supply consistent with what Sanjay indicated as our long-term expectations around industry growth rates.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Amit Daryanani: I guess, two for me as well. First, the 100 basis-point headwind that you mentioned from 3D XPoint that’s impacting you in May quarter, how do I think about that number in August quarter? What do you have baked into your guide with regard to that number and when do you see that getting to a neutral level essentially?
Dave Zinsner: As I mentioned earlier, it’s roughly in the same range for next quarter, assuming that we do not sell any 3D XPoint to our partner. I wouldn’t rule that out, as I said before, and that could happen in any quarter or multiple quarters quite honestly where we do sell product to our partner. And that would certainly reduce or mitigate that underloading charge. Absent that, I think the expectation is, as I mentioned that 3D XPoint products would start to be introduced in late calendar 2019 and the expectation is they would start to ramp shortly thereafter. And we’ll start to see the benefits of that in terms of bringing our underutilization charges down over time.
Amit Daryanani: And then, if I could just follow-up, cloud server demand, especially the hyperscale side has been fairly robust for you guys, I think it’s across DRAM and NAND both. And I understand all the medium to long term dynamics that you guys have outlaid. But in the near term, I guess, is there a concern that perhaps some of the strength you have seen these customers prebuying or buying ahead and you may see a period of digestion over the next couple of quarters as a use for the capacity they’ve taken up. So, I guess from where you sit, do you have visibility and comfort that whatever you have shipped into these hyperscale OEMs is getting used and absorbed and not just prebuying on that -- from their end?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, as I pointed out earlier, we work closely with these customers and really are building strong relationships across the board. We do not see trend of building or holding product. We don’t see that. I mean we -- the demand in cloud applications has continued to increase. You have heard cloud operators, the major cloud operators increased their CapEx in Q1, calendar Q1 ‘18 over Q4 ‘17, by more than 20%. And on a year-over-year basis in calendar Q1, CapEx spend by major cloud holders increased by -- cloud operators increased by over 100%. So, this -- and of course meaningful part of that total cost CapEx from cloud operators is certainly going towards compute and storage and memory. And we are playing a good role in terms of supporting the needs of those customers. So, no, we do not see these trends. We work closely in assessing overall their demand requirements and expectations. And keep in mind that this is a global trend in terms of cloud data centers growth and there are several large operators around the world. And we are well engaged with most of them. So, if ever, there is any pause from any one of them, it doesn’t overall matter because the total trend is one of continuous growth. Again, given the value that memory and fast storage brings to the end market applications that these cloud providers are enabling for consumers as well as for businesses.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.
Harlan Sur: Given the normalization in NAND pricing, is the team starting to see price elasticity effects starting to kick in? In other words as you guys work with your customers on their second half product launches, are you seeing SSD attach rates and notebook PCs increasing and are you seeing more content per application in areas like smartphones and IoT devices?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Yes. Certainly, we do see that average capacities of NAND continue to go up in smartphones, we discussed that at the investor day as well, and certainly for DRAM keep going up as well. In the high end smartphones, 6 gigabyte DRAM is being used. And that average capacity over time, even phones getting introduced in the future with 8 to 10 gigabyte, even 12 gigabyte. And similarly on the smartphone side, certainly average capacity of NAND content is continuing to increase nicely. I think at investor day, we had pointed out that there is a smartphone introduced in China that has in fact a terabyte of flash content. So, average capacities are continuing to increase. And yes, certainly, with the benefit that 64-layer technology has brought to the industry in terms of enabling lower manufacturing cost certainly is enabling content growth, not only in the mobile market but also in SSDs. And last year in SSDs, somewhat average capacity growth had somewhat stalled, given the supply constraints that existed last year. And now with the benefit of 64-layer, certainly average capacities are expected to continue to increase over the course of next several years. And yes, replacing HDDs as well both in client computing application as well as in enterprise applications with increasing attach rates and average capacity increases as well.
Harlan Sur: And there has been some reports of your competitors struggling on advanced DRAM node transitions. Sanjay, can you just confirm that the Micron team is -- you guys are hitting your cost per bit targets at the 1X nanometer node? What do the initial yield and manufacturabilities look for as a team? And then as you ramp initial production volumes of 1Y in the second half of this calendar year, can you just talk about also your ability to hit your cost targets and manufacturability targets? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, we’re executing very well on our 1X as well as 1Y technology for DRAM. I think, we had already indicated that how on 1X DRAM technology we had RAM to mature yield much faster than the previous generation technology note and we have talked about that on 1X, we are on track to achieve bit output crossover in our supply in second half of this year. So, we’re absolutely on track there and very pleased with the progress on 1Y technology node in DRAM as well, which we will begin production of in the second half of this year, of course following customer qualifications.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen. Your line is now open.
Karl Ackerman: I had a follow-up to last question. So, it is widely reported that one of your competitors is struggling with yields on not just 1X but also 1Y. So, do you still expect to have 10% of wafers out on 1Y this calendar year? And I guess, would you expect to have a more measured pace of the capacity expansion plans or perhaps is your guidance for fiscal ‘18 capacity expansion plans in part, acknowledging some of this pause from the 1Y yield ramps or yield learning on 1Y? And I have a follow-up, please.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, I don’t think we have stated the core in terms of our 1Y technology mix. What we have said is that in the second half of this year we will begin production of this technology following customer qualifications. Of course that will then ramp up gradually over period of time. And of course we will be then focused on ramping up the production yields of the technology as well. I think, you’re confusing the 10% with what we have said regarding the Hiroshima space expansion. What we have said is we’re expanding the cleanroom space in Hiroshima by 10% in order to implement the 1Y transition of the install capacity there. That does not mean that we will have 10% of our DRAM production in 1Y technology. That is not the case. So, I hope I clarified that with you. But as I said earlier, we’re pleased with the progress that we’re making with our 1Y technology development and really pleased with the execution focus of our entire team on accelerating our technology development and focus on deploying these technologies into production in order to enable us to catch up on the cost competitiveness in the industry.
Karl Ackerman: Fair enough. I tried my luck on 1Y. Perhaps more of a longer term discussion. So, there are several new memory fabs announced in China in Yangtze Memory I think seems to be the furthest along. While it appears these indigenous fabs may struggle near-term to access IP beyond lagging edge NAND technologies, thus limiting any real impact on supply, I was curious to hear your thoughts on how you think about the opportunity to sell supply agreements to indigenous Chinese companies in exchange for perhaps large upfront prepayments that could be used for both investment and capital return. Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Again, as we have said, we are focused on executing to our strategy in terms of accelerating technology development and cost competitiveness and executing well on our products. We see strong demand trends for our products in our end markets, in the well-diversified market that we have talked about. So, I think this is what we’re focused on and this is the best way for us to focus on high ROI, return on our investments, and that’s our focus here.
Operator: Thank you. Our question will come from the line of Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is now open.
Steven Fox: Thanks. Good afternoon. Just one question for me. You guys early in the call mentioned multiple qualifications were underway on the eMCP products. I was curious if you could put a little color around that and whether you’re referring to the rest of this year, into next year, and maybe types of customers, geographic regions et cetera that you may be seeing most demand from.
Sanjay Mehrotra: With respect to eMCP, we are engaged with a broad set of customers in terms of getting our products qualified. The shipments that we have made with respect to eMCP are with 32-layer. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we’re also focused on qualifying 64-layer based eMCP products. And just will like to point out that along with eMCP products, we are of course also focused on qualifying our 64-layer based UFS and MMC products with our customers as well and seeing good traction there. This is all part of our strategy of shifting our portfolio toward high-value solution. Having both DRAM and NAND in those eMCP solutions gives us a unique capability to provide a strong value proposition to our customers. And of course, these solutions are also, as we pointed out in our embedded markets, automotive markets. So, there is a broad set of customers that we are engaged with for our eMCP and discrete Managed NAND solutions.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Your line is now open.
Vijay Rakesh: Hi, guys. Thanks for the opportunity. Good quarter and good guide. Just one question. As you look at the 96-layer and 1X, can you talk about what kind of cost reduction you see once it gets to steady levels?
Sanjay Mehrotra: We do not provide cost reduction for these technologies. For competitive reasons, we don’t disclose that. But, I can tell you that in NAND, if you look at our track record and Micron’s capabilities of CMOS under the array we have produced the smallest die in the industry with our 3D NAND. And on the DRAM front, we are continuing to focus on bringing in next generation technology nodes to narrow the cost gap that we have currently in the industry. And we are making very good progress as you can see in our results of FQ3 as well as in our guide of FQ4; we’re making very good progress on all those fronts.
Vijay Rakesh: Last question here on the -- when you look at the second half, obviously first half has been very strong. As we go to the half, where do you see inventory levels in both DRAM and NAND?
Dave Zinsner: So, inventory, as you probably noticed, was up a little bit this quarter. I’d point out that finished goods inventory was actually down by about $50 million. It was all up in whip and that was driven by this crossover on 64-layer and the ramp up of the 1X technology that drove the inventory up. Early to make a prediction on next quarter, but maybe what I’d tell you more holistically is as Manish talked about in the analyst day, we really are looking at inventory and intend to make good progress on just refining our ability to manage with lower days. So, that’s kind of our goal. But, that’ll happen over time.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session today. Thank you for your participation on today’s conference. This will conclude our program and we may all disconnect. Everybody, have a wonderful day.

Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Shanye. Good afternoon. During the second quarter, Micron, once again, set company performance records across multiple metrics, including revenue, gross profit, EPS and cash generation. We are consistently delivering results that underscore our relentless focus on execution and solid progress on our strategic priorities. Specifically, we are evolving our product portfolio to a richer mix of high-value solutions, enhancing our financial performance and cultivating deeper relationships with more key customers across multiple mega markets. Our growing portfolio of managed NAND solutions and low-power DDR4 products boosted our mobile business to record revenue and profitability during the quarter. We also grew our SSD shares in our second quarter with total SSD sales up 80% year-over-year and sales of cloud and enterprise drives more than tripling for that same period. Continued strong penetration of our highly competitive DDR4 products into cloud applications and our industry-leading high-performance graphics memory portfolio into gaming, graphics and cryptomining applications contributed to a robust 15% sequential growth for our Compute and Networking Business Unit. Strong demand for our DRAM and NAND products delivered record second quarter revenues for us in the automotive market. We continue to execute well on our goal of introducing new products on our advanced technologies, delivering performance, quality, supply and cost advantages to our customers. In NAND, we are transitioning from being the components supplier to becoming a solutions provider. We launched and began qualifications of the industry's first cloud and enterprise SATA SSD drive incorporating 64-layer 3D TLC NAND. We also introduced the 3DFS solutions targeted at flagship smartphones. These solutions are also based on our 64-layer 3D TLC NAND, which has 15% higher performance and double the density of the prior technology. We have qualified a family of these products with a major chipset vendor and we expect to complete customer qualification in the coming months. In DRAM, our focus remains on enhancing our cost competitiveness and accelerating our product execution. We have qualified our 1X nanometer DRAM at three of the world's largest hyperscale customers, with other qualifications underway. We also garnered positive feedback on our 1X nanometer LPDRAM solutions and set industry benchmarks for power efficiency, which is particularly critical to our mobile customers. Our comprehensive and expanding portfolio of DRAM, NAND and NOR solutions has enabled us to achieve record design wins for our automotive business in the first half of fiscal 2018. We believe we are well positioned to continue to support our share leadership in this rapidly growing market. These achievements illustrate our focus and the ability to deliver value to both our customers and shareholders.  I'll now discuss some of the trends we are seeing across our end markets, which will continue to expand the significant opportunities for our business in the years ahead. At Mobile World Congress recently, phone manufacturers featured high-end smartphones with larger 4K displays, multiple high resolution cameras and 4K HDR video recording. Capabilities like these have driven increased memory and storage requirements in recent years. But perhaps more most impressive were the multiple implementations of artificial intelligence and virtual reality. OEMs are bundling new artificial intelligence, augmented reality. OEMs are building new artificial intelligence, augmented reality and lifelike virtual reality capabilities into high-end smartphones, including facial and voice recognition, realtime translation, fast image search and scene detection. To support these data intensive capabilities, flagship and high-end smartphones are migrating towards 6 gigabytes of LPDRAM, a trend that bodes well for Micron given our leadership in LPDRAM power efficiency, which is essential for optimizing battery life. Average storage SSDs are also increasing across all smartphone classes with new flagship models using 64 gigabytes of flash memory at a minimum. Micron's portfolio of managed NAND solution is well-suited to address this growing demand, and we are leading the industry in TLC utilization with a portfolio that leverages the strong attributes of our 3D NAND technology. Of course, the growing adoption of AI is not limited to mobile. At the Consumer Electronics Show, several companies showed AI smart cockpits in new automotive models. These systems integrate the instrument dashboard, infotainment and telematic systems with a centralized compute and storage architecture to create a data center on wheels. Voice and gesture recognition, combined with driver alert monitoring capabilities, are making automobiles more intelligent and much more compute intensive, requiring higher capacity and more powerful memory and storage solutions. Micron is already working with automotive customers who will benefit from our highest speed automotive-grade, LPDDR4 solutions in the near term and new memory technologies in the future like our high-bandwidth GDDR6 graphics memory. The new features in mobile, automotive and other connected devices require rapid data analysis in storage and enterprise and cloud servers, including machine learning, training and inferencing to complement the compute taking place at the edge. This is driving significant investments in the data center and growing demand for both memory and high-performance storage. Micron's broad technology portfolio and strong innovation engine position us well for these growth trends. We continue to partner with our customers to ensure our technology and engineering roadmaps deliver the critical features for tomorrow's solutions. Now I will provide an update to near-term industry supply/demand dynamics. The dealer market today is very different from the PC-dominated market of the past. This market now supports a healthy demand environment with several secular demand drivers that I have discussed earlier. More specifically, memory is making possible applications such as AI and VR, and enabling new cloud-based business models which deliver a fundamental value far in excess of a price per bit. Against this healthy demand backdrop, we project DRAM industry bit output to grow in the 20% range for calendar 2018, maintaining favorable industry fundamentals.  For the NAND market, we believe the ongoing transition to 64-layer 3D NAND creates the opportunity for a more balanced industry dynamic in calendar 2018 versus the constrained conditions we saw in 2017. We expect industry bit output growth to be somewhat higher than 45% in calendar 2018, providing incremental supply to address the increasing demand created with the further displacement of HDDs in client, enterprise and cloud applications. From a Micron perspective, we continue to make significant strides to strengthen our competitive position through technology and cost improvements. In DRAM, we are focused on accelerating our technology transition cadence and ramped our 1X nanometer technology to mature yield faster than any of our previous technology nodes. We remain on track to achieve 1X nanometer bit output crossover relative to our 20-nanometer node by the end of calendar 2018. We now expect Micron's calendar 2018 DRAM bit output growth to be in line with the industry's 20% range. In NAND, our 64-layer technology continues to ramp very well with yields somewhat ahead of plan. We continue to execute plans to achieve bit output crossover on our 64-layer 3D NAND technology relative to 32-layer in the second half of fiscal 2018. We believe we will be somewhat above industry bit output growth in calendar 2018 for NAND.  We expect to deliver qualification samples to OEM customers of both our 1Y DRAM technology and our third generation 3D NAND technology by the end of fiscal 2018. And we continue to expect to ramp initial volume for each of these new nodes in the second half of calendar 2018. For some time now, industry participants have pointed out that the cost and complexity of DRAM and NAND scaling is increasing with each subsequent technology node. Additional space and equipment is required to manufacture the increasingly complex architectures of these leading technologies to maintain data capacity and meet market demand. Accordingly, we are executing plans to add clean room space in our NAND and DRAM SAS network. With the support of the Singapore Economic Development Board, we have finalized plans to build additional shelf space in Singapore, adjacent to our existing NAND Center of Excellence. The primary purpose for this new clean room space will be to transition our existing wafer capacity to future 3D NAND nodes. This location will enable us to drive efficiencies of scale. We expect to build out this facility in phases, in line with our manufacturing requirements and market demands. The first phase of this clean room is expected to be completed by the summer of 2019, with initial wafer output from the facility expected in the fourth quarter of calendar 2019. We are also building out incremental clean room space in our fab in Hiroshima, Japan, which will be available for production at the beginning of calendar year 2019. This clean room space will be used to continue our 1Y nanometer DRAM transition. For fiscal year 2018, we expect our capital expenditures to be in the upper end of our previously guided range of $7.5 billion, plus or minus 5%. Long term, we target capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue to be in the low 30% range. Before we move to the next section of our call, I would like to address a supplier maintenance issue, disrupting nitrogen supply to 1 of our 5 DRAM SAS which occurred on Tuesday of this week. We expect this event will impact our DRAM production output by 2% to 3% for the quarter. Our teams are working around-the-clock to recover from the situation and we expect to return to full production within the next week.  Lastly, I would like to welcome Dave Zinsner as our CFO. Dave brings years of experience within the semiconductor industry, and we are happy to have him on board. Dave will now provide details on our second quarter results and third quarter outlook.
David Zinsner: Thank you, Sanjay. I'm excited to be joining Micron at a time when the company is accelerating its focus on execution, including the delivery of more high-value solutions and the ongoing improvement of cost competitiveness. During my first few weeks at the company, I've been diving into the details of the business and operations, and I'm more convinced than ever that there's a fantastic opportunity to build an even stronger company while continuing to enhance shareholder value.  For the second fiscal quarter, revenues were $7.35 billion, up 8% from the prior quarter and 58% from the prior year. The overall strength reflects a positive business environment and broad-based demand for our memory and storage solutions, particularly for cloud, enterprise and mobile markets. Non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter were 58.4%, up 300 basis points from the prior quarter and up from 38.5% in the prior year. Our ability to drive a richer mix of high-value products, strong execution on our cost goals and favorable market conditions contributed to the gross margin expansion. Non-GAAP operating margin was 49%, up from 46% in the prior quarter and 25% in the prior-year period. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $666 million, up approximately 9% from both the prior quarter and prior-year periods. The sequential increase is primarily attributed to expenses associated with shifting our portfolio to high-value solutions and accelerating our technology and product development. These expenses tend to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. We're also beginning to incur the impact of solely funding the development of our fourth generation 3D NAND technology. We continue to manage operating expenses tightly and are generally only increasing operating expenses for developing and qualifying new products and technologies. Turning to performance by business unit. The Compute and Networking Business Unit grew revenue to $3.7 billion in the second quarter, up 15% from the prior quarter and 93% year-over-year. Cloud server revenues were up nearly 30% quarter-over-quarter as hyperscale customers continue to invest in data center infrastructure and broaden their service offerings. We also benefited from strong demand for graphics memory with cryptocurrency mining augmenting sales for gaming applications. Operating income increased to $2.3 billion or 63% of revenue, and reflects higher sales of our 1X nanometer DRAM solutions, along with tight supply conditions. The Mobile Business Unit achieved its highest ever revenue and operating income in the second quarter of $1.6 billion and $680 million, respectively. These results compare to $1.1 billion of revenue and $170 million of operating income for the same period last year. Our performance underscores our laser focus to meet customer's needs. The Embedded Business Unit reported revenue of $829 million in the second quarter, in line with last quarter, and up 41% year-over-year. The automotive business had a record quarter, driven by strong sales of ADAS and in-vehicle experience applications. We also saw an increase on our industrial business, driven by the growing industrial IoT markets, expanding factory automation, transportation and surveillance applications.  Operating margins were 44% in the fiscal second quarter, expanding by 260 basis points compared with the first quarter. And finally, turning to the Storage Business Unit, revenue was $1.3 billion, up 20% year-over-year, supported by record revenue in SSDs. On a sequential basis, SD revenue declined by 9% with the strong growth in SSDs offset by a reduction in components revenue. The sequential revenue comparison was impacted by a mix shift within our NAND component sales, which I'll elaborate on momentarily. We're continuing to penetrate the SSD market and expand sales across each end-market, consumer, compliant -- client, enterprise and cloud. The growth is most pronounced in the enterprise and cloud SSD portion of the market. Our sales of these end markets were up nearly 30% quarter-over-quarter and more than 230% year-over-year. As we previously noted, product developments for 3D crosspoint solutions is now underway.  During the second quarter, and over the next few quarters, we have incurred, and will likely to continue to incur, costs associated with production capacity underutilization in advance of volume ramp of these new 3D crosspoint products. These charges negatively impacted our SBU operating margins by approximately 500 basis points this quarter. Including these charges, second quarter operating margins were 20% compared with 29% in the fiscal first quarter and 7% in the prior-year period. Moving to performance by product line. DRAM represented 71% of total company revenue in the fiscal second quarter. DRAM revenue in the quarter was up 14% from the prior quarter and 76% year-over-year. Sequentially, shipment quantities increased in the mid-single-digit percentage range while ASPs increased in the low double-digit percentage range. DRAM non-GAAP gross margin was 66% in the second quarter, up 4 percentage points from the prior quarter and up 22 percentage points from the year-ago quarter.  Revenue from trade NAND represented 25% of overall company revenue in fiscal second quarter. Trade NAND revenue on the quarter was down 3% sequentially and up 28% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, shipment quantities increased in the low double-digit percentage range, while ASPs declined in the mid-teens percentage range. The sequential ASP decline in NAND increased in part due to a meaningful last time purchase of higher price MLC NAND in the fiscal first quarter. This is the mix shift in our SBU NAND components that I have referenced earlier. Trade NAND non-GAAP gross margins were at 47% in the second quarter, down 2 percentage points from the prior quarter but up 16 percentage points from the year-ago quarter. Gross margins for both SSDs and managed NAND solutions increased quarter-over-quarter, offsetting the declines in component margin. This change in mix illustrates the importance of shifting our sales towards high-value solutions. I'd like to take a moment to update you on the impact of U.S. tax reform on Micron. The onetime impact related to the taxation of accumulated offshore earnings and cash was largely neutral for the company. The impacts of this repatriation transition tax were largely offset by our accumulated tax losses and other tax credits. For the remainder of the year, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain in the low to mid-single-digit percentage since we are not yet subject to certain provisions of the new tax code. For fiscal 2019 and beyond, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to settle in the low teens percentage range. Going forward, we'll benefit from having greater flexibility to access our worldwide cash deposits. Our non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.82, up 15% from the prior quarter and up over 200% from the prior year. As a result of our record performance, we generated $4.3 billion in cash from operations, which represented 59% of revenue. This compares to $1.8 billion in the year-ago period. Capital spending, net of third party contributions, was $2.1 billion, resulting in a very strong free cash flow adjusted for the third-party capital contributions of $2.2 billion or 30% of revenue. This compares to free cash flow of approximately $600 million in the year-ago period. As Sanjay mentioned earlier, we expect capital spending, net of third party contributions, to be at the upper end of our fiscal 2018 guided range of $7.5 billion, plus or minus 5%. As a result of the strong free cash flow, we ended the quarter with approximately $8.7 billion in cash, marketable investments and restricted cash. The face value of our debt increased approximately $200 million to $9.5 billion. A $300 million reduction in debt due to scheduled debt repayments was offset by a $500 million increase in debt at our IMFT joint venture. Since the first of our 3D crosspoint products are expected to launch in calendar 2019, we chose to defer funding for IMFT. Our partner is contractually able to make the funding on our behalf and designated a debt on IMFT's balance sheet. And that debt is then counted as part of our debt for the purpose of GAAP reporting. We still expect to be in a net cash positive position in the fourth quarter, and possibly sooner, depending on the extent and timing of any future convertible note redemptions. This net cash positive position remains a significant milestone in the ongoing strengthening of our financial foundation. We continue to evaluate additional opportunities to accelerate our deleveraging actions that will provide a high rate of return. This strong financial profile is the result of consistent execution and focus across the entire company. Now turning to the fiscal third quarter guidance. As Sanjay mentioned, we had a maintenance issue at one of our Taiwan DRAM fabs this week, which is impacting production. We expect this event to decrease our total revenue by approximately 2% in the third quarter, which we've accounted for in our guidance. Having said that, we continue to experience a strong demand environment and we, therefore, expect fiscal third quarter revenue to be in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion, and non-GAAP gross margins to be in the range of 57% to 60%. We expect to see an increase in operating expenses, again, associated with product and technology qualifications, and the funding of our fourth generation 3D NAND technology, both of which primarily impact R&D. Considering these costs, non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $725 million, plus or minus $25 million. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion. Based on a share count of approximately 1.25 billion shares, these results should drive non-GAAP EPS of $2.83, plus or minus $0.07. I'll now turn the call over to Sanjay for some concluding remarks.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Dave. Micron will be celebrating our 40th anniversary this fall. Innovation has always been a key cornerstone to our success, ensuring that our technologies and products quickly adapt to serve the world's growing appetite for faster data. As we look ahead, we remain focused on nurturing and fostering an accelerated pace of innovation, and I know our team is fired up and ready for the challenge. The opportunity to create a dramatic impact on the world around us is undeniable and I'm excited to be part of this team shaping that future. I'm looking forward to speaking with all of you at our analyst and investor event in May. You can expect us to provide more detail on how we see secular market trends, creating new opportunities for memory and high-performance storage, and why we believe Micron is well positioned to win. We will now open for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill from Needham & Company.
Rajvindra Gill: I was wondering, Sanjay, if you could talk a little bit about the changes in the DRAM industry that you've seen over the past year or so. I think in the past, you had mentioned that memory is becoming a strategic differentiator for high-performance computing. I was wondering if you can maybe elaborate on what specific end markets or behavior patterns that have been changing with some of your main customers in terms of how they consume memory.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Certainly. I think we are seeing the fastest growth through our DRAM memory at large-scale, in cloud computing and hyperscale data centers. And this is where high-performance memory is absolutely becoming essential along with fast storage is becoming essential for the trend such as AI, which are really driving new business models. Whether you go from education and training tailored toward the individual levels of coaching or training to the individuals or to millions of transactions processed realtime in the financial sector, to detect fraud or going to diagnosing and treating life-threatening diseases. Bottom line is we are barely starting with AI in cloud computing and data centers. And to realize the full impact of these solutions and to truly provide this new business model and services and applications to consumers and businesses alike, more and more data needs to be processed. It needs to be realtime analytics, and that requires more fast memory and more fast storage, that means flash as well as DRAM. So we are seeing tremendous growth. And if you look at trends, when we project that 2017, about 145 gigabytes per server going to about 350 gigabytes per server by 2021. Similarly, if you look at flash storage, 1.5 terabyte average in 2017 growing to something like 6 terabyte average with each server by 2021 timeframe. So these are massive, secular demand trends in the cloud computing and hyperscale for memory as well as for flash storage. Similarly, going to mobile, I talked about in my script that at Mobile World Congress, several new phone models were introduced that leverage 4K SDR capabilities that leverage AR and VR and even in our processors that are being introduced for mobile application that actually have the AI unit built into it. So just imagine how much data-intensive applications are now being run in order to provide users smooth experience. That then requires high performance and lot of memory. And you're starting to see now 6 gigabyte phones, 6 gigabyte of DRAM in the phone. So mobile is another large driver of DRAM memory. And of course, it is also a large driver with average capacities continuing to increase for flash as well. And then autonomous driving is barely starting. I mean, industry pundits are talking about robo taxis, intercepting the whole autonomous driving trend and maybe being introduced even in 2019-2020 kind of timeframe. And autonomous driving means, as I said in my remarks, data center on wheels. It's requiring more fast memory to again make all realtime decisions providing for the safe and comfortable and efficient driving experience. So these are really massive trends and these are secular in nature and I believe will continue to drive strong demand for DRAM in the years ahead. And of course, there are other ones, continuing average capacity increases in PCs for DRAM, with more gaming features and VR features. And of course, industrial 4.0 initiatives. I mean, these are all multiple mega markets for DRAM. And we are very well positioned with our product portfolio focusing on cost competitiveness, with our technology advancements as well as what I indicated, low-power DRAM solutions which are becoming increasingly important across a multitude of these applications.
Rajvindra Gill: That's very helpful, Sanjay. As my follow-up, your SSD revenue was up 80% year-over-year. Can you talk a little bit about the attach rate for client SSD specifically? Last year, they were put on a temporary pause because of tightness of supply. I was wondering if you could talk a little about that now that we're about a quarter into this year?
Sanjay Mehrotra: I mean, last year's flash was severely constrained and that did somewhat slow down the cash rate of SSD in client computing as well as slow down the march towards higher capacities of SSDs in notebook computers. And attach rates for SSDs in client computing, around 35% to 40% and maybe 40% in 2018, maybe going towards 50%. Over the next few years, this is expected to continue to go toward by 2020-2021 timeframe to 85%-plus attach rate for SSD. So again, this is a large growth driver for SSDs in client computing applications. And we are focused on, of course, expanding our portfolio of SSDs. We talked about significant progress of our SSDs across-the-board in client, enterprise as well as in the consumer market. And we look at opportunities to gain further share in all of these SSD markets in the future as we continue to execute on our product roadmap.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely from Citi.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Wayne Loeb [ph] on the line for Chris Danely. My question is when you talk about your plans for acquisitions, what would be the criteria that would make you buy something? And how does M&A fit into your plan in the context of Micron wanting to be a NAND solution provider?
Sanjay Mehrotra: We're not going to speculate on M&A matters here but we are very pleased with the portfolio of technologies and the initiatives we have with respect to continuing to advance our product solution. But of course, we do not rule out, in the future, leveraging M&A toward any growth initiatives. And of course, we'll always look for core capabilities to expand the market opportunities for Micron. And of course, we'll be focused on value in terms of any acquisition that we may entertain in the future, again, not speculating on anything at this point. And of course, always looking for ROI kind of opportunities.
Unidentified Analyst: As a follow-up question, can you talk about what Micron's projected cost reductions are for NAND and DRAM this year?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So we don't provide specifics on cost reductions but what I can tell you is that we are making very good progress on our technology. As we indicated, I mean, in our 1X DRAM technology, we have achieved the fastest ramp to mature yield in the history of the company. And similarly, our 64-layer technology, it has ramped to mature yields, rather well and we are continuing, of course, to do very well on our 20-nanometer DRAM technology that we use as well. So we are very pleased with our continuing progress on cost at the technology level, and continuing to focus on advancing our next-generation technology nodes and products. And of course, also very much focused nonmemory costs in our products such as SSD nonmemory costs. So making good progress and all of that is baked into our gross margin guidance that we have provided.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney: First question, I hope you can detail a little bit more about that nitrogen issue you mentioned. Did you have to scrap wafers or just idle production? And can you help us reconcile the comment about a little bit less DRAM output for next quarter with the now full year guidance about growing in line with the industry compared to last quarter. I think, Micron was going to grow slightly before -- definitely below, excuse me.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So this nitrogen maintenance issue has not caused trapping of vapors. It has idled or slowed down production. As we said, it's impacting 2% to 3% of our this quarter's DRAM production output. And with respect to our expectation of our output growth for calendar year 2018, that remains in line with the industry estimate of 20%, and this effect is already included in that as well.
Mark Delaney: Is it fair to assume a better 1X nanometer yield? Is that how Micron is now growing in line with the industry for the full year despite this nitrogen issue?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Yes, that is correct that our production output is expected to grow in line with the industry and that is, of course, as a result of our excellent yield on 1X nanometer node as well as the 20-nanometer node.
Mark Delaney: Okay. And then one other question for me, if I could. Sanjay, you commented about having a CapEx-to-sales target in the low 30% range. I don't want to parse words too closely, I think it was about 30% as of the last Analyst Day. But the strategy for Micron, as I understood it, had been that the company is trying to keep its net DRAM wafer starts flat and there's a lot of costs associated with getting to these new nodes because of all the extra factory space that you need and need for new clean rooms. Just given your comments about CapEx coming in toward the higher end of the range this year and the comments about that ratio, is there any change about the strategy of Micron, how it's thinking about CapEx? And really just enabling -- getting to those next nodes which are getting more expensive? Or is there a change we need to be thinking about in terms of how Micron is thinking about managing its net wafer starts in DRAM?
Sanjay Mehrotra: I think if you look at last few years and you look at Micron's revenue and you look at Micron's CapEx, you will see that Micron's CapEx, over the course of last few years, is in the low 30% range of the revenue over those last few years as well. So what we have said here today is fairly consistent with what actually has been the case at Micron over the course of the last few years. And in fact, if you look at the industry itself and you look at the revenue of the industry players and you look at the CapEx, over the course of last few years, you will see actually that, that average for the industry as well is in that same range also. So in terms of our own strategy for CapEx spend is absolutely focused on accelerating our technology transitions. So our CapEx is geared toward realizing DRAM and NAND technology transition toward more cost-effective advance technology nodes for our products. And it is not about capacity, wafer capacity production increase for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman from Cowen and Company.
Karl Ackerman: Dave, welcome to the team. I have two questions, please. My first question is on DRAM demand. We all know that DRAM is more inelastic than NAND but I was curious, what are some signs that you look for to assess if you are beginning to see demand destruction in DRAM demand from higher ASPs, particularly in mobile and PC environments that are more sensitive to price than hyperscale environments? I have a follow-up, please.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So can you clarify the question to me? I didn't totally get the question. I'm sorry.
Karl Ackerman: Yes, I'm just curious how should we assess the potential demand destruction in DRAM demand from higher ASPs in mobile and PC environments over the next few quarters, if there were to be an issue?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So I think what we have to realize is that DRAM absolutely is essential to the experience in the business models that it enables. Whether it is the experience in mobile phones, I talked about all these experiences, AR, VR, 3D gaming, multitude of applications and users absolutely expecting seamless experience that requires -- such data-intensive applications require more DRAM. So it is essential. I mean, it's not like you can offer a model with a less DRAM in it, a high-end model with a less DRAM in it and expect that users will still have the same good experience. So DRAM capacity has really become a key enabler and essential element of mobile. And same, as I talked about earlier, for hyperscale data centers. When they look at what models that they can enable for their end customers, those are all being built on very data-intensive applications. I mean, imagine retailers, and a consumer goes into a retail store and the retailer already knows about what are the needs of their consumer. All of that requires realtime -- for retail, realtime AI applications, which means lot of data that has been processed fast, which means, again, it needs more DRAM memory. So it is actually, when you look at hyperscale data centers, it's not about the cost of DRAM anymore. I think the value that it enables to these cloud applications and hyperscalers is far in excess of any aspect of DRAM price per bit. So DRAM really has become an essential part. This is very different from any time in the past.
David Zinsner: And the best indicator of this is that DRAM pricing is strong and DRAM demand is strong right now.
Karl Ackerman: That's helpful. As my follow-up, I was hoping you could elaborate on your comments for OpEx as we think about the trajectory of spending for the next few quarters. Specifically, do you plan on reinvesting the savings you expect to achieve from Micron and Elpida coming together for the first time on 1X development? And how should we think about the timing of any planned prequalification expenses for maybe 1X DRAM or QLC 3D NAND deployment when we make assumptions for OpEx for the balance of 2018?
David Zinsner: So let me go back to kind of the commentary and make sure it's clear. So in the second quarter, most of the increase we experienced was around qualifications of various technologies that kind of all came together, all in kind of the second quarter. And it kind of continues on into the third quarter. Those expenses kind of vary over time. And so this just happens to be kind of a couple of quarters in which that activity is pretty heavy. And so we're kind of experiencing kind of a lift in expenses, and I would expect that portion of it to kind of settle down. And when the next set of qualifications are required, it will come back up again. The other piece of the expenses really relate to our fourth-generation 3D NAND where, as we announced earlier, we're taking that on ourselves. About half of that hit us in the second quarter. We'll have the full quarter's effect in the third quarter, and that was about $20 million on a full quarter. So about $10 million left in the second quarter and $20 million lift in the third quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra from Baird.
Tristan Gerra: Given the continued strong demand that you see in data center, how should we look at the initial supply/demand outlook in NAND flash for the second half of calendar '18? Should we expect the pricing to stabilize? Any commentary based on trends that you see currently continuing for the rest of the year?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So we are not going to comment on pricing trends in the industry but what I can tell you is that NAND industry does have certain aspect of its end market such as USB flash drive or imaging cards or retail. That tends to be more somewhat seasonal in the first calendar quarter. And as we go forward, that part changes. The most important thing to look at is that as more supply becomes available, it drives deeper penetration of SSDs in client devices as well as in -- gives an even stronger value proposition in enterprise and data center applications. So this is what we expect during the course of the year. And of course, average capacities of NAND in mobile phones, smartphones, continue to increase as well. And we are expanding our portfolio of multichip packages with DRAM and NAND, which is where Micron is uniquely well positioned to expand our opportunities and increase our shares with NAND flash and DRAM-based solutions in multichip packages as well as discrete NAND solutions such as the UFS that I talked about that are in the stages of qualification with our customers. So we look ahead at the year with strong demand drivers for NAND in the industry and growing opportunities for our NAND business for the remainder of the year, calendar year here. And very focused on execution of all our new product introductions and qualifications with our customers because those will ultimately drive our success toward high-value solutions as part of mix of NAND revenue.
Tristan Gerra: Okay. That's useful. And then as a quick follow-up, is it fair to assume that the high double-digit growth rate in better demand for NAND in data center is something that is possible again for this calendar year?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Yes, for this calendar year, for data center, absolutely, NAND bit consumption in data center is expected to be 50%, in the range of 50% or higher. Basically, a data center is where demand will grow faster than the average of the industry. Keep in mind, same thing for client SSDs as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini: Sanjay, I have a follow-up. You and others in the memory industry have been discussing opportunities in moving up the stack. At the same time, some of your enterprise customers are also trying to navigate their way and move up the stack. And I'm just wondering, what's wrong with keeping the business as is? Your NAND gross margin is in the 45% to 50%; DRAM gross margin is in the 65% to 70%, and assuming that the industry is rational and we can't avoid excess capacity, why not just focus on making the most cost-effective DRAM and bit and capitalize on the margin profile? And I have a follow-up.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So let me be clear that we are very excited about the market opportunities for DRAM and NAND. All the things that we have been talking about so far over the course of the last 45 minutes here. And of course, our strategy is to continue to strengthen our competitive -- cost competitiveness as well as increase the mix of high-value solutions in our revenue. And by high-value solutions in our revenue, we mean products such as SSDs as well as managed NAND solution because we have both DRAM and NAND and that gives us a unique opportunity to provide management solutions for today's smartphones that are needing more and more of such solutions. So we are absolutely focused on leveraging our core capabilities to drive cost reductions, catch up on the DRAM cost with the rest of the competition and in the NAND, strengthen our portfolio of these high-value solutions. And I have no doubt that there is -- nobody is taking their eye off the ball and we have relentless focus on strengthening the execution engine of the company and tremendous opportunity ahead in that regards for us. It's already implied through the strong results we have demonstrated so far but there is even greater opportunity ahead of us.
Mehdi Hosseini: In terms of costs, you recently introduced a QLC 64-layer 3D NAND SATA SSD. Is there any way you can either quantify or qualitatively discuss the cost per gigabyte that this particular product offers you? And how we should think about its ability, due to lowest cost, to penetrate and displace existing technologies?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So what we introduced recently is a 64-layer bit TLC SATA SSD. And as we have said before, QLC is certainly an exciting opportunity for Micron in the years ahead, and QLC is in the development stages. And it is not a 2018 phenomena. I mean, that is something that's more like 2019 opportunity, starting in 2019 timeframe.
Mehdi Hosseini: But should we assume that this offers you, perhaps, I'm just going to give you a number, could it still offer a customer less than $0.20 per gigabyte of cost?
Sanjay Mehrotra: We don't get into cost discussions. And our focus, of course, is to develop QLC solutions that will be, in the future, going toward applications that are very read intensive and somewhat balanced in terms of more write applications. And of course, our goal would be to drive these -- build value in these solutions, especially going toward high-capacity aspects of the storage market, build value in these solutions so that we can be selling them in a profitable fashion and bringing strong value to our customers as well. I'm not going to get into pricing or speculate of the pricing for QLC.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt Securities.
Hans Mosesmann: Sanjay, if you can just clarify, I think somebody asked the question before but I'll just make it more concise. Are you seeing any despeccing in DRAM or NAND market? And I have a follow-up.
Sanjay Mehrotra: We're not seeing any despeccing. If anything, again, given the nature of the application, the average capacity requirements continue to go up in all end markets arena.
Hans Mosesmann: Okay. And then a follow-up, more of a longer-term or midterm question. After 1Y in the DRAM world, how many more node transitions or half transitions do you expect you and the industry to have before you hit a wall, if you will?
Sanjay Mehrotra: We have talked about our 1Z technology node in DRAM and our engineers are working on that. And engineers, of course, always continue to look at opportunities for further scaling. And concurrently, we are working on other advanced technologies of the future as well.
Hans Mosesmann: Okay. But there's no letter after 1Z at this point?
Sanjay Mehrotra: There is no letter in the alphabet after Z.
Hans Mosesmann: You can go to 1Zb or you can add a plus, plus or plus, plus, plus.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you. We'll take you up on your suggestion.
Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho.
Vijay Rakesh: Just on the NAND side, I was wondering what percent of your NAND was SSDs? I know you mentioned it grew 80% year-on-year and seeing good traction enterprise.
David Zinsner: We don't give that breakdown.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. And I know you talked about 3D crosspoint. There's a bit drag on the margins. When do you start to see the drag go away? And I was just wondering, as you look at that ramp by the end of -- by year-end, what proportion do you think that would be of your NAND?
David Zinsner: So 3D crosspoint products are expected to come out in -- sometime in calendar year 2019. We will have -- sometimes we'll have underloading charges. It's possible that our partner might take some of the -- of those wafers so that would obviously help on the underutilization. Of course, as we start to release those products, about late 2018, we'll start to build some of those wafers and that will help out on the underutilizations as well.
Sanjay Mehrotra: And I just want to comment on your earlier question regarding SSD. Of course, we don't provide the specifics but clearly, SSD is growing fast and it's increasingly large portion of our revenue. And very pleased with the progress that we have made in increasing the mix of SSD in our portfolio.
Operator: This does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'd like to hand the program back to management for any further remarks.
Shanye Hudson: Thanks, Jonathan. As always, we appreciate your interest and support for Micron. I'd remind you that a copy of the prepared remarks as well as a webcast replay can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website later this afternoon. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's Micron Technology's second quarter 2018 financial release conference call. You may now disconnect.

Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Shanye. Good afternoon. Micron's record first quarter results demonstrated the company's continued strong execution, a market environment that reflects the strategic importance of memory and flash storage and healthy supply and demand fundamentals. During the quarter, we continue to enhance our cost competitiveness, achieving yield maturity on both 1X DRAM and 64-layer 3D NAND. We improved our mix of high value solutions, delivering record SSD revenues and further increasing our SSD shares. More recently, we began shipping our first 64-layer NAND consumer SSD. We also introduced the industry’s fastest high-density 32GB NVDIMMN, which combines Micron’s DRAM and NAND to deliver a persistent memory solution that addresses intense data analytics workloads. We have garnered solid interest from enterprise and cloud customers, and customer qualifications are underway. And, we strengthened our talent bench with the recent addition of Manish Bhatia, who leads our global operations. Manish brings extensive experience in managing end-to-end operations and is focused on driving manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies to reduce costs and improve our agility. Finally, we improved our financial foundation with the retirement of $2.4 billion of debt. I’m pleased with our accomplishments and believe our focus on speed and execution better position Micron to deliver value to our customers and capture the increasing number of end-market opportunities. I will now discuss trends and results in each of our major markets. Cloud and traditional enterprise data center trends are continuing to drive robust demand for memory and flash storage solutions. Our Q1 SSD revenue to cloud and enterprise customers increased 50% sequentially. We recovered from the flash component issue discussed in our September earnings call that impacted last quarter’s SSD sales. On the compute side, we had solid sequential DRAM revenue growth into data center markets, driven primarily by enterprise sales. DRAM bit shipments to both cloud and enterprise customers were up by more than 50% year-over-year, underscoring the data center’s growing need for memory and our strong execution in this market. Our 1X nanometer designs have been well received by cloud customers, with more than a quarter of our cloud revenue in Q1 coming from our 1X technology. Fast qualification and production ramp by our cloud customers of new technology node products is a significant benefit, as it diversifies and accelerates our customer traction and market reach during early stages of production deployment of these advanced nodes. The need to access, analyze, and store data extends well beyond the cloud. This is perhaps most apparent in the mobile market. Smartphone capabilities have surpassed simple communication and web browsing, they help us navigate, monitor, and interact with the world around us. New cameras capture precious moments with amazing fidelity, and emerging applications like AR have tremendous promise. This increase in functionality is driving the use of higher-capacity memory solutions and increased storage in mobile devices. These trends, along with our solid execution, drove record mobile revenue in FQ1. We are strengthening our offerings and continue to diversify our portfolio of LPDRAM, MCP, and discrete managed storage solutions to meet the growing needs of our customers. We are accelerating our progress to expand our portfolio of low-power solutions with the release of new products such as our 1X LPDRAM designs. We also shipped initial samples of our 64-layer NAND discrete UFS solution to chipset partners and customers, with very promising results. Home automation and edge computing devices continue to drive strong revenues in consumer and industrial market segments, which require a wide variety of memory and managed storage products. As more edge devices begin to integrate machine learning and intelligence, we see opportunities to provide higher-performance memory and flash storage solutions in these markets. We have also seen rapidly growing demand for our graphics products. The graphics market continues to be fueled by the ever-growing popularity of gaming and eSports. Although smaller in size, recent interest in crypto currency mining has put further pressure on graphics memory supply. Our close customer relationships and leading product portfolio helped drive record graphics revenue, up more than 75% year-over-year. We sampled industry-leading 16Gb-per-second GDDR6 products to key customers and are seeing significant interest in automotive and networking applications that need the high bandwidth this memory provides. We plan to ramp GDDR6 to production in early calendar 2018 for the graphics market, followed by other high-performance applications such as automotive and networking. The rapid innovation in automotive technology towards autonomous driving continues to create significant demand for higher memory capacities and greater performance. We secured a key design win in an important autonomous driving platform this quarter and are focused on replicating our success to retain our leading share in that market. Automotive customers are moving more rapidly to new memory technologies than they have in the past, and our announcement of the fastest 1X LPDDR4 and GDDR6 products for autonomous driving applications will ensure we continue to support this shift to leading-edge technologies. We also set record revenues supplying the networking applications that serve data centers and edge devices, as our reputation for consistency and innovation drives strong ties with networking customers. These diversified growth drivers and structural market trends are generating tremendous opportunity for Micron. We are uniquely positioned in these markets with a broad portfolio of both DRAM and NAND solutions, excellent quality, and comprehensive customer ecosystem engagement. We are focused on developing the right products, deepening our customer relationships, and enriching our revenue mix to capitalize on these opportunities. Turning to manufacturing and technology, our ability to execute our technology roadmap and drive cost competitiveness are foundational to our ongoing success. In terms of wafer manufacturing plans, we still expect to achieve bit output crossover on 64-layer NAND during the second half of FY2018 and expect to achieve bit output crossover on 1X DRAM by the end of calendar 2018. We are outfitting our new back-end factory in Taichung, Taiwan, to ramp assembly and test capacity, and expect meaningful output from the facility before the end of the fiscal year. Our capital investments are tracking with our deployment plans, and we are seeing good traction in improving the efficiency and cost effectiveness of our operations through these investments. Both 1Y DRAM and third-generation 3D NAND development are progressing well, and we remain on track for initial output of both in the second half of calendar 2018. We continued to make good progress with our 3D XPoint technology. Historically, Micron’s efforts on 3D XPoint have been largely focused on technology development and early manufacturing ramp, but given our increased focus on high-value product solutions, we have recently resourced a product development team to address the opportunity ahead of us. Simultaneously, we are working with various players in the ecosystem to assess market and enablement opportunities, and we will provide further details of our views regarding these opportunities during our upcoming analyst event. We will also continue to have the opportunity to sell our 3D XPoint output to our partner as this market develops. Switching to our industry outlook, our supply and demand projections remain consistent with what we shared last quarter. DRAM industry supply bit growth is expected to be about 20% in calendar 2018, and we expect a healthy market environment, driven by the ongoing enterprise data center, cloud, and mobile strength as we just discussed. We expect the industry bit growth for NAND to approach 50% in calendar 2018, as the industry continues to ramp 64-layer designs into volume production. SSD adoption in client computing and data center applications continues to increase and will expand further as more supply becomes available over time. Against that backdrop, projections for our own bit growth remain unchanged, we expect our DRAM bit growth to be slightly below the industry, and we expect our NAND bit growth to be somewhat above the industry for fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2018, we are focusing on technology transitions for both DRAM and NAND, without any additions to our total wafer capacity, and on improving our mix of high-value solutions to enhance our revenue share. For fiscal 2019 and beyond, we continue to assess scenarios for the fab clean room space required to implement technology transitions to future, more advanced DRAM and 3D NAND nodes. I’ll now turn it over to Ernie to provide details on our first quarter results by business unit.
Ernie Maddock: Thank you, Sanjay. And thanks to all of you for joining the call today. We had a very strong start to our fiscal year, exceeding guidance across all financial metrics, driven by strong execution, a continued robust market environment, and further progress on our technology migrations. For FQ1, total company revenue was $6.8 billion, up 11% from the prior quarter and up 71% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded to 55%, up 4 percentage points from FQ4 and 29 percentage points from the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP operating margin was 46%, up from 41% in the prior quarter and up 35 percentage points from the year-ago period. We continue to prudently manage spending with non-GAAP operating expenses totaling $612 million for the quarter, up 2% from FQ4 with both SG&A and R&D remaining relatively flat quarter-on-quarter. Non-GAAP net income increased to 44% of revenue and totaled approximately $3 billion, or $2.45 per share. This performance compares with $2.4 billion or $2.02 per share in Q4, and $335 million or $0.32 per share from the year-ago period. Turning to performance by business unit: The Compute and Networking Business Unit reported FQ1 revenue of $3.2 billion, up 13% sequentially and more than double year-ago levels. Our record performance was driven by increasing server memory content, which drove higher sales to enterprise customers together with strong demand for graphics processing. Operating income was 60%, compared to 56% in FQ4 and 14% in FQ1 2017. Q1 Storage Business Unit revenues increased 7% sequentially to $1.4 billion, driven by strong growth in SSD sales. On a year-over-year basis, revenues were up 61%, driven by increasing market share in SSDs. In fact, sales of SSDs reached record levels in the quarter, with double-digit sequential growth across Consumer, Client and Enterprise and Cloud markets. SBU operating margins increased to 29% from 19% in the prior quarter, and negative 5 percent in FQ1 2017. These results reflect a higher value product mix and continued market acceptance of our TLC 3D NAND based products. The Mobile Business Unit reported $1.4 billion in revenue, up 16% sequentially and up 32% year-over-year. We are seeing strong acceptance of our LPDRAM products and continue to enhance our portfolio of managed NAND offerings. The solid demand environment, combined with the traction we’ve made with our latest-generation products, led to operating income of 37%, up from 31% in FQ4 and 9% in FQ1 2017. The Embedded Business Unit reported revenue of $830 million in FQ1, in line with the prior quarter and up 44% year-over-year. Operating margin was 41%, essentially flat from the prior quarter and up 10 percentage points year-over-year. As Sanjay noted earlier, we continue to see exciting demand trends across each of the underlying embedded markets with evolving end-market requirements ranging from high-performance memory required for autonomous driving, to ultra-high-density storage solutions for edge devices such as video surveillance cameras. We are focused on building upon our existing leadership position to capture these growth opportunities. Turning to results by product line: DRAM represented 67% of overall company revenue in FQ1. Demand for client PCs, solid exposure to new flagship smartphones, and ongoing strength from servers, particularly in cloud and hyperscale data centers, drove DRAM revenue higher during the quarter, up 13% sequentially and up 88% year-over-year. Sequentially, shipment quantities increased in the upper single-digit range, while ASPs increased in the mid-single-digit range. DRAM non-GAAP gross margin was 61.5% in FQ1, up 2 percentage points from the prior quarter and up 33 percentage points from the year-ago quarter. Revenue from trade NAND increased by 2% sequentially and represented 27% of overall company revenue in FQ1. Trade NAND revenue was up 47% year-over year, driven by our strong growth and market share gains in the SSD market and robust demand from the mobile and embedded markets. On a sequential basis, shipment quantities increased in the mid-single-digit range, while ASPs declined in the low single-digit range. Trade NAND non-GAAP gross margin was 49% in FQ1, up 9 percentage points from the prior quarter and up 26 percentage points from the year-ago quarter, reflecting a richer mix of sales into high-value end markets. As Sanjay noted in his prepared remarks, we are making strong progress on the roll-out of our 1X DRAM and 64-layer 3D NAND deployment. The roll-out of these technologies will enable meaningful levels of ongoing cost-per-bit reduction as we make progress throughout fiscal ‘18. For DRAM, our bit output growth will be more heavily weighted to the first half of the fiscal year, while NAND bit output growth will be relatively greater in the second half of the fiscal year. The company generated operating cash flow of $3.6 billion in FQ1, compared to $1.1 billion in the year ago period. During the quarter, we deployed $1.9 billion for capital expenditures, net of partner contributions. We continue to expect FY18 CapEx in the range of $7.5 billion plus or minus 5%, fairly balanced between the first and second halves of the fiscal year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.7 billion, compared to negative free cash flow in the year-ago period. We continue to pursue our plans to strengthen our balance sheet and lower debt. During FQ1, we raised $1.4 billion from an equity offering and repurchased or converted $2.4 billion in principal amount of our debt. Total face value of debt was $9.3 billion as of the end of FQ1, and we currently expect to exit FY18 with approximately $8 billion in face value debt. We expect the interest savings from these de-leveraging actions, combined with higher interest income from larger cash balances and the anti-dilutive effects of settling converts for cash, to materially offset the dilutive impacts associated with the equity offering. Exiting FY18, we foresee non-GAAP net interest expense of $25 million $30 million per quarter versus $100 million per quarter in FQ4 of ‘17. We ended the first quarter with cash, marketable investments, and restricted cash of approximately $6.6 billion and continue to see the opportunity to exit FY18 in a positive net cash position. Moving on to guidance for FQ2 2018, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following: Revenue in the range of $6.8 million to $7.2 billion; Gross margin in the range of 54% to 58%; Operating expenses between $625 million and $675 million; Operating income ranging between $3.25 billion and $3.45 billion, and; EPS ranging between $2.51 and $2.65 per share, based on 1.241 billion diluted shares. Finally, a word about tax reform, as drafted, the legislation would have no significant impact to our FY18 tax rate, which we continue to expect to be in the mid-single-digit range. In FY19 and beyond, we would expect some impact to our non-GAAP tax rate, with an offsetting benefit of more flexibility in deploying our global cash balances. As further clarity around this legislation develops, we will provide appropriate updates. With that I will turn it back to Sanjay.
Sanjay Mehrotra : Thank you, Ernie. As we close out calendar 2017 and look to 2018, we see increasing opportunities for Micron to play a larger role in the technology trends shaping modern life. We will be hosting an analyst conference in May, where we plan to elaborate on our view of these trends and how Micron envisions our technologies shaping the world in the years to come. We believe that our technologies, capabilities, and team talent place us in a unique position in the market. Memory and flash storage are strategic assets that put Micron at the intersection of the biggest growth trends in technology, and we cannot be more excited about our future. Our customers increasingly view us as an essential partner in early design discussions due to the differentiation our solutions can provide. We are focused on increasing this value, and I look forward to sharing the results of that focus throughout 2018. We will now open for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you and our first question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie Securities. Your line is open.
Srini Pajjuri: Thank you and congrats on a great quarter guys. A couple of questions on the NAND side, Sanjay at least among the investor community there seems to be some concerns that there is going to be a flood of supply coming online into the industry in the first half. I am just wondering if you have any thoughts about what your view is about the supply-demand balance as we head into the first half? And then for Ernie, the NAND gross margin improvement is 900 basis points sequentially, I know you mentioned mix healthy there, but I am just curious if you could provide some more color as to exactly what’s driving that and how sustainable that is going forward?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So in terms of the industry demand-supply environment, let me just say that, with respect to the industry supply growth in the calendar year 2018 we have said that the industry supply growth would be approaching 50%. While that is more than what the calendar year ‘17 supply growth is, it is in the range of 35% to 40%. The overall what you have to look at is the demand requirements. In calendar year 2017, of course supply has been tight, there has been pent up demand particularly in the areas of client SSDs and the client PC, notebook PC environments. The march toward high density SSDs in notebook PCs was somewhat slowed down given the overall tightness of supply in calendar year 2017. When I look ahead at calendar year ‘18, I see strong demand trends with respect to attach rate of SSDs and client PCs continue to increase the applications related to cloud and data centers, enterprise data centers continuing to drive higher average capacities usage in cloud and data center applications as well. And certainly mobile applications also the average capacities of NAND content continue to increase. And these are all increasing because of the trends, right? I mean, attach rate in notebook PCs in calendar year ‘17 about 35%, going toward over the course of next several years by 2020 timeframe getting to 75% attach rates. So lot of HDD that is still to be replaced with SSDs and same trends are continuing in all markets for NAND average capacities are continuing to increase. So the demand trends continues to be very robust flash, yes, more supply environment. But we are very focus on continuing to strengthen our product portfolio and increased our share with respect to SSD markets as well as with more managed NAND solutions to address the mobile markets. 
Ernie Maddock: And relative to the question about margins, I think there are two pieces of that. One, we are making progress toward a mix -- higher value added mix of solutions and those typically carry the opportunity for higher margins. Also we continue to make progress on the cost side with respect to increasing amount of 3D NAND, as well as TLC and you had a good quarter for cost reduction as well. So it’s a combination of both market facing with the higher value add solutions and a good quarter from an operational perspective relative to costs.
Srini Pajjuri : Thank you. And then maybe just one follow-up Ernie on the balance sheet, I think you previously said your gross debt target is about $8 billion, which you said you are going to reach I guess next quarter. Given assuming that the tax bill will pass, is there any change to that target? And then if you can talk about again assuming that the tax bill will pass, what’s your priorities for cash going forward?
Ernie Maddock: Yes, I don’t think we have said that we’d reach that gross debt target in FQ2, we said by the end of our fiscal year. And so I wouldn’t expect that we would achieve that level in fiscal Q2. The tax bill, as we understand it would not necessarily change the priorities, which are always to continue to make sure we have the best technology we can in production and to be able to transition that at a time that make sense for us. And then for fiscal year ‘18, certainly getting the balance sheet in shape relative to these aggregate levels of debt.
Srini Pajjuri : Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open. 
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon and congratulations on the solid execution. On the DRAM side you’ve got Intel ramping sky lake, you have AMD ramping EPYC on the server CPU side, cloud and hyperscale CapEx spending looks to grow about 30% next year. Given all of these, do you guys anticipate continued momentum and mix in your server and cloud business in DRAM to continue to move higher next year? And then from an industry perspective does the server and cloud segment become a bigger part of the DRAM consumption mix over the next two to three years overtaking mobile?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Yes absolutely, cloud and server, data center enterprise as well as cloud, data centers absolutely will continue to be the biggest growth drivers at large volumes for the DRAM industry and we have very strong penetration in these markets. And actually we do expect to continue to build momentum in these markets going forward.
Harlan Sur: Great, thanks for that. And Sanjay you talked about semi and fully autonomous wins in the quarter. All of the major auto OEMs and subsystem guys are focused on this, we talk to one of the leading guys that focused on sensors and processors technology required for these types of vehicles, they are talking about 25-30 gigabytes of DRAM and 1 terabyte SSDs per car for level 4 and level 5 fully autonomous. That’s a pretty significant step up in DRAM and NAND content, is that consistent with how you see the content trends in automotive over the next kind of three to five years?
Sanjay Mehrotra: It’s absolutely is. I mean, when you look at autonomous vehicles, they really are level 5, autonomous vehicles in the future are projected to have about 40 gigabyte of DRAM content in them. And when you think about it that is very similar to the average capacity that are associated with servers in the server workstations, right. So these cars will be really very powerful computers in the future and they are not only going to be driving tremendous amount of DRAM content usage, but they will also drive NAND flash usage. They will be generating using data to make millions of real time split second decisions to make sure that the passengers in the autonomous vehicles can be transported effortlessly and safely to their destination. There will be sensors from sonar to cameras that will be generating billions of signals and all of that data will have to be processed, accessed in order to make fast decisions. So you are absolutely right to note that this is really a secular trend here in front of us in terms of driving continued usage of memory and storage. Earlier we talked about cloud and data center applications and again those are growing faster than the rest of the industry, autonomous vehicles will be another big driver in the future.
Harlan Sur: Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: And Micron is uniquely positioned with the strong portfolio of solutions both with its flash solutions as well as DRAM memory solutions to address these fast growing market trends.
Harlan Sur: Thanks, Sanjay. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is open. 
Blayne Curtis: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and clearly congrats as well. Couple of questions, maybe on DRAM, can you just go back to the servers been a huge driver and that's really been without Intel’s clearly still the minority units. Can you just maybe talk about content per server, how much that increased this year and then as you look into next year how much of the driver is clearly as you look into second half and that being more meaningful?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So in terms of content per server I think 2017 if you look at flash attach rate it's about average capacity around 2,500 gigabytes. And when you look at projection over 2018 timeframe growing to anywhere above 3,000 gigabyte average capacity continue to march ahead by 2021 timeframe almost tripling from the 2017 levels well above 8,000 gigabytes as well. So that is on the SSD side, and similarly on the DRAM side, average capacity is continue to increase nicely there as well. In 2017 timeframe about 145 gigabyte per server average capacity estimated and industry reports are showing that by 2021 timeframe going to about 350. So, very strong solid and year-over-year increases not just in near-term, but again as I say these are secular trends here.
Blayne Curtis: Thanks for that. And just on the NAND side, I just want to go back that part of question, obviously you are seeing a across over of 64, how do you think about the cost trajectory here as you then start to ramp 3rd gen as you look to the fiscal year is there any sort of -- what's the slop of that costs curve as one is going up and the other one is going down?
Ernie Maddock: As we introduce 3rd generation 3D NAND, we would continue to expect that that technology of mature yield have or has favorable cost dynamics relative to 64 layer. We don't believe that it will have a significant positive or negative impact in our FY18 results as we will just be implementing that as we get into the last quarter of the fiscal year. So, it won’t be material enough either way to change the fundamental dynamics that we're going to see this year, which is largely driven by our 64 layer TLC NAND.
Blayne Curtis: Thanks, Ernie. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy with Stifel. Your line is open.
Kevin Cassidy: Hi, thanks for taking my question. You had mentioned when you gave your guidance for CapEx for the year about adding more value added into your DRAMs and Flash. Can you say what percentage right now would you call in the value added group and what's the goal for that?
Sanjay Mehrotra: In the value added solutions category we count our SSDs in that and in fiscal Q1 we had really solid increase in our SSD revenues, we gained shares in the market as well. In the mobile space, managed NAND solution are also and discrete NAND solutions, we consider as value add as well. Our share in those markets today is relatively low, low single-digits, but we see tremendous opportunity as we are continuing to diversify our product portfolio. And as we execute on that product roadmap in the quarters to come, we expect to be gaining -- making substantial progress.  And of course in the DRAM side, applications such as automotive, such as graphics, high performance applications they all contribute toward the value add solution. We are not providing any specifics at this point. We'll discuss more details at our Analysts Day in May.
Kevin Cassidy : Okay, great. And maybe just as one follow-up is because especially DRAM market had been such a commodity market, are you getting any push back from your customers that they want you to move more towards the commodity?
Sanjay Mehrotra: And let me just point out in response to your previous question that while we will provide more detail in May, but on a year-over-year basis, certainly we are increasing our value-add solution mix substantially and very pleased with the progress that we are making. Regarding your second question on DRAM, DRAM really is a strategic enabler today in diversity of markets and the mega trends we talked about whether it is data centers, cloud applications being the few for AI engine helping make decisions for various search algorithms as well as various activities in all verticals that are being pursued leveraging AI in mobile space as more and more applications go toward augmented reality type of features in mobile requires more DRAM, DRAM is highly strategic. Even in the future when you look at notebook computers, they will require the form factor and the low power aspect, even in PCs of LPDRAM in future years to come. So you see and of course we just talked about automotive as well. So now DRAM is addressing diversity of markets, I mean, several large diverse markets product portfolio meeting the needs of these markets is becoming differentiated and when that happens that always gives you stronger opportunities to drive profitable growth in that market. And our customers when we have an engagement with them, when we have dialogues with them they are talking to us how memory, DRAM memory is really now helping them solve the bottleneck in their applications. So DRAM today is very different, as I said many times before from the DRAM in the PC era only or when it was about just PC and mobile, today it is about many more applications of DRAM. And really providing a very strategic enabling role in creating all these applications that are truly transforming the world right before arrives.
Kevin Cassidy : Great, thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. 
David Wong: Thanks very much. I’, not sure that you said it, but on the November quarter, how much of your total NAND production was 3D NAND? And as you transition to 64-layer in the February and May quarter next year, did your NAND production drop or grow sequentially?
Ernie Maddock: So about 80% of our output for the quarter just completed was on 3D and over the course of the balance of fiscal ‘18 we would expect that number to grow to about 95%. We expect that we’ll have some measure of bit growth as we said each and every quarter we said it would be in the prepared remarks little more heavily weighted to the back half of the year.
David Wong: But you never let will grow in the first half?
Ernie Maddock: Yes. 
David Wong: Okay, great.
Ernie Maddock: Yes, that output for the quarter was up in the low single-digit range.
David Wong : Excellent, thanks very much. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is open. 
C.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question on DRAM, you talked about 20% bit supply for the industry in ‘18, which would suggest continued tightness throughout the whole year. So curious how customers are reacting to that reality, what kind of visibility are you seeing to pricing, as well as extension in contracts?
Sanjay Mehrotra: We work very closely with our customers and we certainly work hard in terms of gaining visibility to their future requirements of DRAM and how their applications are shaping up so that we can make sure that our technology and product roadmap is adjusting their needs. And this varies from customer-to-customer. Some customers tend to be more on a month-by-month basis, some more quarter and some certainly longer term engagements as well. And you are right to note, that yes, I mean, the industry supply growing about 20% and demand likely to be somewhat higher, we do expect a healthy DRAM industry supply and demand environment and continue to work very closely to drive strategic growth of our revenue mix going forward.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. And I guess as my follow-up on the NAND side you are talking around 50% bit growth or approaching that for that industry one or two of the other players in the market are expecting lower type of bit growth. So it would appear that you are making assumptions around the 64-layer ramp that might be a little bit more robust than your competitors. So curious how are you thinking about that ramp? And clearly I think you would agree the risk is probably lower than 50%, how would you kind of I guess put a probability around where you think it truly ends up?
Ernie Maddock: So of course in terms of projecting, our industry bit growth estimates here. We of course are taking into consideration our estimate of the ramp of 64-layer technology in the industry and our assumptions around the ramp of wafer production as well as yield ramp of that technology. And along with other mix of technologies in the industry as well, but you are right to note that the dominant factor of the supply bit growth in the industry will be with 64-layers here. And we continually look at our estimates and we review it based on all the intelligence that we may have, as well as we may collect from third-party reports we refine our models on an ongoing basis, and if we have any changes on this we will share them with you.
C.J. Muse: Thank you very much. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe More with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. 
Joe More : Great, thank you very much. I wonder I know you don’t want to get too far ahead yourself on this, but when you get to sort of net cash neutral and you get to investment grade, what’s next from a prioritization of free cash flow. And how do you just qualitatively think about cash return versus maintaining cash for a more strategic usage?
Ernie Maddock: I think that we will continue to prioritize the supporting our latest generation technology in production as we talked about for fiscal ‘18 clearly focused on getting aggregate debt down in that $8 billion range. Those things will lead to we believe overtime improved ratings. But I think how we think about deploying cash is not wholly dependent upon the achievement of any particular ratings grade. We just think these are things that will be worked in parallel. And at the appropriate time I think we are very open to thinking about broader uses of cash including shareholder return programs. So those do have a place in the hierarchy of thinking about uses of our cash. But until we get to the point where we have completed or substantively completed our work on this technology deployment and regaining cost competitiveness and also getting our aggregate debt levels to the -- to a level that we are more comfortable with certainly those will continue to remain our priority.
Joe More : Great. And then I wonder the disparity between the 60% operating margins in the compute business and mobile which is still quite high, I guess to meet sort of you can see that PC DRAM still quite a bit more profitable than mobile. How do you think about that going forward in terms of your allocation of mix obviously mobile gives you more stability down the road versus the upside that you can get from PCs, how you are thinking about that balance?
Ernie Maddock: Yes, don’t forget that the Compute and Networking Business Unit includes a wide array of products, which includes both clients but also includes data center, mobile -- not mobile but networking and other products as well. So it isn’t just a statement about the client compute environment and many of those sub segments within the Compute and Networking Business Unit we would also consider strategically important these are relationships where we have the opportunity to deploy both DRAM and NAND. And certainly mobile continues to be important.  So I wouldn’t necessarily presume that the margin performance out of our Compute and Networking Business Unit is largely driven by the performance of clients.
Joe More : Thank you very much. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura/Instinet. Your line is open. 
Romit Shah: Yes, thank you. Sanjay since some of your equipment, semi cap equipment suppliers have -- it just seems like over the last three months have been raising their spending forecast for 2018 driven impart by higher DRAM investments. So my question is what’s the risk that your competitors perhaps are going more aggressively for share and that the 20% growth assumption you laid out for next year may actually end proving conservative?
Sanjay Mehrotra: I think the gain I would estimate today for DRAM as well are based on all the information from various sources and reports that we gather and we have put that here. I do think that even when you look at that estimates by other suppliers they are all pointing to fairly close tightly aligned industry supply growth estimate here. And -- but this is our estimate, we will as I said before for NAND same thing, we routinely look at this very, very closely. And just also remember that the technology transitions in the industry today certainly are becoming increasingly complex and they have greater capital intensity, as well as with the advance technology nodes you are actually getting less bits on a per wafer basis even at mature yields compared to prior generation nodes. Again given the scaling challenges increased complexity. So, all of these trends are actually increased technology complexity and increased capital intensity have a moderating effect on the supply growth.
Romit Shah : Thank you. And then just on the February quarter, I don't know if you guys look at your individual periods on a seasonal basis, but it seems like the February quarter typically is a down quarter and you are guiding to sequential growth off of a better than expected November period. What's driving the better than normal seasonality for you, is it pricing or other factors as well?
Ernie Maddock: Yes, I think Sanjay mentioned earlier the diversification of the DRAM demand stream and certainly that is also true on the NAND side. And in the context of that diversified demand stream, for example, automobile tend to be far less seasonal than the client PCs and if you look at datacenter deployments among all of the key players there are certainly a specific pattern for customer. But when you put them all together, there is no macro seasonality pattern that emerges when you look at that. So, as we've transitioned to these diversified demand drivers the concept of seasonality I think has been redefined and is perhaps less impactive on a quarter-be-quarter basis than it may have been in the past.
Romit Shah : Interesting, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer with Summit Redstone. Your line is open.
Jagadish Iyer: Thanks for taking my questions. Sanjay, two questions, first, if NAND ASPs continue to decline from rising supply, do you expect cost reduction to keep pace with the ASP decline as we look at fiscal ‘18? And then I have a follow-up.
Sanjay Mehrotra: I mean, we are certainly not projecting pricing for fiscal year ‘18 here. But again what I'll point to you is that if you look at the history of NAND, increased technology capabilities, technology advances which leads to cost reductions ultimately enable opening up of many new market application and drive the elasticity in many of these markets as well and drive the demand environment. So, I consider it as healthy if the cost declines are greater than the price declines in the industry, that's a healthy industry environment. And while we don't get into the projection of again when we look at all the demand drivers that are ahead of us, I spoke about it repeatedly in the call today multitude of demand drivers and in each of these large market segments again whether it is about could data center, enterprise data center, mobile, smartphones, client notebook, automotive applications all of these are continuing to drive strong demand trends for NAND flash application.
Ernie Maddock: Yes, I think the one thing I would add to that as well as if you think about our statements around industry bit growth which are approaching 50%; those would be associated typically with fairly healthy levels of cost reduction. We're not going to get into the specifics of what that might be. But it is important to remember that that bit growth usually would be accompanied by some good cost reduction as well.
Jagadish Iyer: Okay, fair enough. Then on the 3D XPoint, I was wondering how much are you year marking for spending in fiscal ‘18? And has there been customers who have identified and how should we think generally on a big picture about pricing there? Thank you.
Ernie Maddock: So this is Ernie. The 3D XPoint CapEx and any associated R&D expenses, the CapEx piece is embedded in our non-volatile estimates for the year, which we said was between 35% and 45% of our total spending. And as we look at that product we’re going to have to see how the markets develop, as Sanjay mentioned before we provide any broader perspective on that. 
Jagadish Iyer: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open. 
Steven Fox : Thanks good afternoon. Two quick questions for me, first of all you mentioned the market share gains in SSDs and I assume some of that was related to fixing the component issue, but can you sort of give us some more color on where you think specifically you had most success in gaining share? And then secondly, I know you are not going to talk specifically about pricing for the upcoming quarter, but if you could maybe qualify some more how you get to your sales guidance in terms of pricing and mix that would be helpful. Thanks.
Sanjay Mehrotra: In terms of SSD share gain during the quarter, we believe we gained share both in client applications as well as enterprise and cloud data center applications. Really our products did very well there and at this point our offerings are with SATA drives and next year we will bring out our NVMe solution sometime during calendar year ‘18. And that should help us expand our portfolio and give us opportunities to continue to gain share in this market. And regarding our guidance that we have given you, of course we have certain assumptions related to total demand and our pricing assumptions are baked in there as well. But obviously for competitive reasons we do not get into discussion of pricing on the call.
Steven Fox : Understood, sorry give it a shot. Thank you, congratulation.
Operator: Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Pitzer: Yes, good afternoon guys, congratulations on the strong results. Ernie maybe I can ask the gross margin question around NAND a little bit differently. I am just kind of curious given that you guys had significant gross margin upside on pricing down low single-digit sequentially under a scenario where pricing continues to decline let’s say at a low single-digit rate sequentially, is there enough mix and cost opportunity for you to maintain and/or grow gross margins from here. How should we think about the parameters that you being able to maintain or grow gross margins relative to your cost and mix availability from here?
Ernie Maddock: Yes, so if we’re framing the scenario in the future as we continue to see sort of marginally declining pricing environment couple of points per quarter or so I think there is ample room for gross margin expansion both as a result of our cost reduction as well as the ongoing transition to high value solutions, which would include redirecting -- continuing to redirect component sales into higher value added solutions as well as some of our partner contracts wind down over the course of our fiscal ‘18 and into 2019. So I think in that pricing scenario that you have set forth, we believe there is reasonable room for gross margin expansion.
John Pitzer: That’s helpful. And a similar question on the DRAM front, you mentioned in your prepared comments that you expect more DRAM bit growth in the first half of your fiscal year than the second half. As we transition into the second half how much -- how many levers do you have on the mix side in DRAM to be able to progress sort of gross margins higher from here?
Ernie Maddock: Yes, I think again the same general story with respect to continuing to move toward higher value add solutions. You heard Sanjay speak too for example increasing the breadth of our managed NAND offerings, if you look at server that certainly a very strong growth pattern here as well as automotive. So I think there are a number of segments where we would continue to expect to be able to optimize our bit output toward, that would give us the best gross margin opportunity. And of course even though our bit output growth is going to be lowering DRAM than NAND we would still expect to deliver some meaningful cost reduction there as I articulated in the prepared remarks.
John Pitzer: Perfect, thanks guys. Congratulations. 
Ernie Maddock: Thanks. 
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. And we will take our final question from the line of Mark Newman with Bernstein. Your line is open. 
Mark Newman: Hi, thanks for squeezing me in. I had a question on CapEx and capacity. So Micron you stayed top of the CapEx quite a bit this year from previous years, but still quite significant under spending some of the ride was particularly Samsung. My question actually is about, how is Micron thinking about the need for fabs longer term, this is more of a kind of longer term question, because both Samsung and Hynix are building brand new greenfield fabs as we speak.  What is the status right now for Micron in both DRAM and NAND in terms of how much space you have available to you in DRAM and NAND? And I understand your goal is to keep wafer capacity roughly flat and grow gigabytes from technology migration. At what point do you need more fab space to keep that spread capacity roughly flat as of course more layers requires more fab space and of course as you shrink DRAM you also need more fab space as well. So do you have any plans for new fabs what would be the plan and how you are thinking about that? Thanks. 
Sanjay Mehrotra: So like you noted in order to realize the technology transition you of course do need space in your clean room to deploy the tools that are required to implement the advance technology nodes. So our fabs have had space here in terms of deploying the technology transitions for example in Singapore going from 32-layer to 64-layer and in the past in Singapore fab for NAND going from planer to 3D nodes as well. And similarly clean room space is something we look at very carefully for DRAMs as well because as I just said, I mean, more clean room space is needed for technology transition.  So as I said in my prepared remarks, I mean, we do continue to assess the scenarios that are needed for future technology transitions and have continue to assess our clean room space requirements. Fiscal year ‘18, we are not looking at any new wafer capacity additions, we are not looking at any new -- any meaningful new clean room space required to implement our technology transition plans in fiscal year ‘18. As I said in my remarks going beyond that we continue to assess various scenarios to implement the requirements for technology and transitions both in DRAM as well as in NAND. No plans firmed up yet, and as and when we look at it we will share these things. Remember any time you build a new clean room it takes several months to build -- construct the building and it takes few months than to roll in equipment into the new clean room and to deploy the equipment, qualify it and build products. So these are things that are to be looked at for the longer term horizon and we are evaluating those scenarios.
Mark Newman: Okay, thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. And this concludes today’s question-and-answer session. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Shanye. Good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter results accentuate an unprecedented year for the company. I thank the Micron global team for maintaining intense focus on our key priorities and delivering outstanding results. Our fourth quarter revenue was $6.14 billion with record gross margin, operating income and free cash flow. Full year revenue, profitability and free cash flow also set company records. Our results were driven by favorable industry fundamentals and solid execution in deploying our next-generation, lower cost technologies and diversifying our product portfolio toward a richer mix of differentiated, high-value solutions. We are excited about future opportunities as customers increasingly recognize the strategic value of our memory and storage solutions across a range of high growth markets. Now, I will share details from each of our business units, followed by our perspectives on industry dynamics and an outline of our corporate strategy. In our Compute and Networking Business Unit, we saw robust growth in Q4 revenue and profitability compared with the prior year. Our results were driven by strong demand in Cloud and Graphics, complemented by a healthy pricing environment. Revenue growth from these two segments significantly exceeded overall CNBU growth, which more than doubled compared with the year ago quarter. Cloud sales are supported by increasing DRAM content per server, which is up nearly 50% versus a year ago. In Graphics, we continue to leverage our industry leading GDDR5 and GDDR5X performance to address strong demand, primarily from gaming. The business unit is also benefiting from the initial ramp of our first-generation 1X 8-gigabit DDR4 product, which was sold primarily into the client and cloud segments. In fiscal Q1, we anticipate continued growth of our 1X portfolio, coincident with the ramp of our second-generation 1X 8-gigabit DDR4 and GDDR5 products, both of which have already been validated at certain partners and customers. We also received initial customer qualifications on our TSV-stacked DDR4 products, enabling modules with up to 128 gigabyte and the highest speeds supported on industry standard server platforms. These products address the growing demand for analytics and in-memory databases in both the enterprise and cloud segments. Fourth quarter revenues in our Mobile Business Unit, were driven by a favorable pricing environment and significant growth in our eMCP business. Due to strong execution, sales from our mobile NAND and eMCP solutions nearly doubled year-over-year. We believe that increased DRAM and Flash capacities in flagship smartphones will continue due in part to new applications such as augmented reality in mobile devices. Our roadmap of new LPDRAM, discrete managed NAND and eMCP offerings position us well to address these market requirements. In fiscal Q4, we achieved our first 1X LPDRAM qualification at a major Mobile OEM and have several others underway. Also, our technology capabilities in 1X LPDRAM Package-on-Package products allow us to offer cost effective, high capacity mobile solutions ranging from 3 gigabyte to 8 gigabyte. We expect volume shipments of these new products in fiscal 2018 following successful customer qualifications. During the fourth quarter, we also qualified our first 3D TLC eMCP and eMMC solutions at a major chipset vendor and now have dozens of high-density products in qualification with several OEMs. We expect production shipments to start later in 2017. Our 64-layer 3D TLC UFS products will also start OEM qualifications later in 2017, enabling us to participate in the mobile market’s highest density designs. The Storage Business Unit recorded a revenue increase of 71% in Q4 compared with the prior year quarter, supported by strong demand for our SSD product portfolio. Late in the fourth quarter, we identified and corrected a flash component issue on select TLC 3D NAND products. We paused shipments of affected products as we worked to implement a solution to the issue, which appeared only under a narrow set of performance conditions. As a result, our SSD revenue declined sequentially during the quarter. Shipments have now restarted and we expect to resume solid sequential SSD revenue growth in Q1. We continued to garner positive momentum with our SSD products across a broad range of customers. Our flagship SATA 5100 SSD has been qualified at enterprise server OEMs, cloud service providers and Fortune 500 companies. Demand for our client SSDs is also strong, with Micron shipping solutions to most leading PC OEMs. We see healthy demand trends for SSDs moving forward. Client SSD attach rates continue to increase. And although storage density growth has slowed temporarily due to a tight pricing environment, we foresee longer term demand for higher density SSDs. We made substantial progress in growing our relationships and our business with cloud and hyperscale customers in fiscal 2017. Cloud data center customers are seeking innovative memory and storage solutions tailored to their workloads. Micron’s unique capabilities and expertise in DRAM, 3D NAND and emerging memory technologies make us a compelling partner for these customers. Our Embedded Business Unit delivered strong performance, growing revenue 39% for the full year. We strengthened our leadership position in automotive in fiscal 2017, with growth driven by increasing connectivity and electronics content in vehicles. Automotive applications continue to require leading edge performance. As a result, we have seen significant ramp of our 20-nanometer DDR and LPDDR technologies this quarter and began sampling automotive-grade 1X DRAM to meet these needs. The growth in edge analytics in both industrial and consumer connected home applications led to record quarterly revenues in both segments. We saw strong growth through the year of our NAND and LPDDR MCP products, driven by form factor and performance needs in applications like machine-to-machine communications, surveillance, drones and home automation. Turning to Micron’s technology progress, our 1X DRAM and our 64-layer NAND production rollout is proceeding on plan and we expect to achieve mature yields in both technologies before the end of calendar 2017. We are pleased with our 1Y DRAM technology progress and are focused on the late stages of technology and product development. Our third-generation 3D NAND development is also proceeding well, with production expected to commence later in 2018. This latest generation technology continues to utilize Micron’s industry leading CMOS under the array architecture, which yields smaller die sizes. We have made significant progress in our technology development and volume ramp execution. We see meaningful opportunities to further shorten the cadence of new technology node introductions, accelerate new technologies into volume production, upgrade our fab infrastructure and expand our captive assembly operations. Through successful execution, we expect to narrow our technology cost gap and optimize bit output growth in both DRAM and NAND, with a disciplined focus on profitable growth. Our fiscal year 2018 CapEx plan targets achieving these objectives through technology migrations, with no new wafer capacity. Ernie will discuss our CapEx plans in further detail later in the call. Our ability to successfully execute our technology transition plans will be a key enabler of our cost reduction and supply bit growth capability in the foreseeable future. Moving on to the demand and supply fundamentals, we expect the industry to remain moderately undersupplied for the rest of 2017 for both DRAM and NAND. We see DRAM industry supply bit growth of about 20% in calendar 2017 and expect it to grow at relatively similar levels in calendar 2018. The DRAM industry supply demand balance is expected to stay healthy throughout calendar 2018, driven in part by ongoing strength in data center and cloud computing trends. We expect Micron’s fiscal 2018 DRAM bit output growth to be slightly below the industry growth rate. Our bit growth is supported by our 1X DRAM ramp, which represented mid-teens percent of our DRAM bit output in Q4 and will grow throughout the next several quarters to achieve bit output crossover as we exit calendar year 2018. We expect industry NAND bit supply growth to finish calendar 2017 in the high 30% range. At these levels, supply remains below demand, which has created a constrained environment. As the industry continues to transition to 64-layer 3D NAND, we estimate industry bit supply growth in calendar 2018 will approach the 50% range, which should better satisfy the current unfulfilled demand. We expect that Micron’s ongoing transition to 64-layer 3D NAND in fiscal 2018 will result in bit output growth that is somewhat higher than the industry range. In fiscal Q4, 64-layer NAND represented mid-teens percent of our trade NAND bit output and we expect to achieve bit output crossover during the second half of our fiscal 2018. The dynamic industry transition to 3D NAND is taking place in the context of a NAND market that has consistently exhibited demand elasticity. We expect this behavior to continue for the foreseeable future as higher-density SSD solutions increasingly displace HDDs in client computing, cloud data centers and enterprise environments and as average capacities continue to grow with more performance-sensitive, storage-hungry devices and applications in mobile and other end markets. These trends support our view that NAND demand drivers will remain healthy into 2018. As I begin my first new fiscal year as CEO, I would like to outline our strategic priorities. First, we are focused on driving our cost competitiveness to best-in-class levels, primarily by accelerating the percentage of our output on leading edge technology, in both DRAM and NAND. Second, we will drive execution excellence, delivering solutions to customers quickly, predictably and in line with their product launch windows. Third, we will accelerate our transition to high value solutions. We intend to lead the industry in deploying disruptive memory and storage solutions. Fourth, we will leverage the full breadth of our capabilities to develop deeper collaboration and partnerships with marquee customers, maximizing our value in the market. And finally, we are strengthening our focus on our teams, investing in the best talent and driving a winning culture. We believe our diligent emphasis on the speed and urgency with which we execute these strategic priorities will have a transformative effect on our market competitiveness and financial performance. I look forward to sharing the results of our progress with you in the year ahead. I will now turn it over to Ernie, who will walk through the specifics of our financial performance this quarter.
Ernie Maddock: Thank you, Sanjay and thanks for joining the call today. Our solid operational execution and favorable market dynamics resulted in excellent financial performance in our fourth fiscal quarter and the full year. For the full fiscal year, we achieved record revenue of $20.3 billion, up 64% from the prior year. We narrowed the technology cost gap with our competitors by successfully executing our technology migration plans. Our efforts resulted in strong levels of DRAM and NAND bit output growth for fiscal year 2017 enhancing our competitiveness while maintaining our wafer output. I will now provide some further details on Q4 results, starting with a breakdown by technology and business unit. DRAM represented 66% of our Q4 revenue with the following segmentation: server held steady at approximately 30%; mobile was 20%; specialty DRAM, which includes Networking, Graphics, Automotive and other embedded technologies, remained in the mid-20% range, and; PC was also in the mid-20% range. Our trade NAND revenue represented 30% of total revenue. The three segments comprised of SSDs; mobile, which includes managed NAND and discrete solutions and MCPs, and; automotive, industrial, and other embedded applications, each represented approximately 20% of our quarterly trade NAND revenue. The remaining 40% of our trade NAND was made up primarily of component sales to partners and customers. Turning to performance by business unit, the Compute and Networking Business Unit reported record FQ4 revenue of $2.8 billion, more than doubling on a year-over-year basis. The growth was supported by strong demand from cloud customers, who are architecting data centers and computing capabilities that enable them to execute their specific strategies. Our successful conversion to 20-nanometer DRAM production and the initial ramp of 1X DRAM output boosted Q4 CNBU operating income to $1.6 billion or 56% of revenue, up 31% compared with Q3. The Mobile Business Unit delivered its highest ever revenue quarter at $1.2 billion, up 76% from the year ago quarter. Mobile operating income also set a record at $364 million, or 31% of revenue. Our results are due in part to the positive progress we have made in qualifying our mobile NAND solutions and we expect this momentum to continue in fiscal ‘18. The Storage Business Unit reported fiscal Q4 revenue of $1.3 billion, up 71% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue and operating income were slightly lower quarter-over-quarter, due to the NAND component issue that Sanjay discussed earlier. With this issue behind us, we are focused on leveraging the progress we have made in penetrating the SSD markets over the past year. We estimate that our global SSD market share nearly doubled in fiscal 2017, enabling record fiscal year revenue for the Storage Business Unit. Our operating income for the fourth quarter was $250 million or 19% of revenue compared with a loss of $57 million in the same period last year. The Embedded Business Unit also achieved record performance in fiscal Q4, with revenue of $827 million, up 18% sequentially and 61% on a year-over-year basis. Growth in the quarter was driven by solid sales for consumer applications, which include home automation. Automotive also remains a key revenue driver for this business, as the shift toward smarter and connected cars is driving increased memory content. These trends bode well for Micron as we continue to capture new design wins and strengthen our leadership position. Operating income for EBU was $348 million in Q4 or 42% of revenue more than doubling year-over-year. Moving on to overall company results, revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter was $6.1 billion, up 10% from last quarter and 91% on a year-over-year basis. Sales of server and SSD solutions each were more than 3x higher than year ago levels, reflecting our focus toward a higher value-add to revenue mix. Non-GAAP gross margin was 51%, up 3 percentage points from Q3 and 33 points from the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘16. The improvement reflects the successful adoption of products based on our advanced technologies, combined with a healthy industry pricing environment. Non-GAAP net income was $2.4 billion, or $2.02 per share. For the full fiscal year, we achieved non-GAAP net income of $5.6 billion or $4.96 per share compared with $273 million or $0.26 per share for fiscal 2016. Turning to results by product line, DRAM revenue more than doubled on a year-over-year basis and increased 13% sequentially. The sequential results reflect a 5% increase in bit shipments. DRAM non-GAAP gross margins for the fourth quarter was 59%, up 39 percentage points from year ago levels and up 5 points sequentially benefiting from an 8% increase in ASPs. We are seeing the benefits of execution on our technology migration plans and the continued strong market environment. Trade NAND revenue increased 81% on a year-over-year basis. Sales were 8% higher quarter-over-quarter, supported by demand from mobile and embedded segments and a 5% increase in ASPs. Trade NAND non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 40%, up 24 percentage points from a year ago and down 1 percentage point sequentially as a result of the NAND-related issues mentioned earlier. NAND bit shipments increased sequentially by 3% during the quarter. Our fiscal year results reflect strong adoption of our 3D TLC NAND products and a strong market environment. As we consider the ongoing progress of the business, as well as the competitive environment, we plan on make a few changes to our disclosures, beginning with FQ1 2018. Specifically, we will be eliminating the presentation of changes in cost per bit and market segmentation detail for each technology. The evolution of our business to higher value-add solutions, which often have higher BOM costs and higher margin opportunities makes cost per bit comparison a less reliable indicator of our progress. Relative to the market segmentation by technology, we will continue to provide qualitative color through our business unit reporting. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $601 million, essentially flat from the prior quarter. The company generated operating cash flow of $3.2 billion in fiscal Q4 compared to $896 million in the year ago period. During the quarter, we deployed $1.5 billion for capital expenditures, net of partner contributions and $5.1 billion for the full fiscal year. DRAM investments were between 40% and 45% of the full year spend and non-volatile memory was around 30%. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.7 billion and for the full year it was $3.3 billion compared to negative $2.7 billion in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2017, we deployed $1.6 billion or approximately 50% of our free cash flow for de-levering activities. The result of these activities represents approximately $0.07 of annualized EPS accretion. We ended the fourth quarter with cash, marketable investments and restricted cash of approximately $6.2 billion. Turning to more near-term matters, as we have been discussing for some time, our two key priorities for cash flow are accelerating the company’s cost competitiveness and improving our financial foundation through reducing leverage. Our fiscal 2018 plan enables both priorities. We currently expect our fiscal 2018 CapEx, net of partner contributions, to be in the range of $7.5 billion, plus or minus 5%. Our investments will be focused on technology transition and product enablement. Generally, we expect that between 35% and 45% of CapEx will be deployed for DRAM, 35% to 45% for non-volatile memory and the remainder for technology and product enablement. There are no wafer capacity additions planned for fiscal 2018. We will continue to target our free cash flow generation for the opportunistic retirement of debt. We see the opportunity to reach our interim target of $8 billion to $9 billion of gross debt during fiscal 2018. These actions, together with the progress that we have made in fiscal 2017, would drive annualized EPS improvement of between $0.18 and $0.23. We also see the potential to be net cash positive as we exit fiscal 2018. Moving on to guidance for fiscal Q1 2018, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following: revenue in the range of $6.1 billion to $6.5 billion; gross margin in the range of 50% to 54%; operating expenses between $575 and $625 million; operating income ranging between $2.65 billion and $2.85 billion; and EPS ranging between $2.09 and $2.23 per share based on 1.191 billion diluted shares. With that, I will turn it back to Sanjay.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Ernie. As part of our strategic planning process, Micron developed a new vision statement that embodies how we see the opportunities in front of us. As we close out 1 year and look to the next, I would like to now share it with you. Our vision, transforming how the world uses information to enrich life, captures the tremendous potential Micron possesses. New technologies like artificial intelligence will change the world in ways we can barely imagine today. Fast data access and high-performance data analytics will be at the heart of those transformations, making memory and storage core to the data-centric world that is taking shape in front of our eyes. I believe our strategy to tighten our focus, accelerate our technology and product development and strengthen our presence in critical markets will make Micron an increasingly prominent player in the industry as these revolutionary new technologies take shape. Fiscal 2017 was a record year for us, but I am confident that the best is yet to come for Micron. We will now open for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, sir.
John Pitzer: Yes, good afternoon guys. Can you hear me?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Yes.
John Pitzer: Yes, Ernie, Sanjay, congratulations on the strong results. I guess, Ernie, my first question just around your CapEx number, $7.5 billion, that doesn’t surprise me as much as your sort of guidance around bit growth for DRAM and NAND for the fiscal year just given the significant jump in CapEx. I am wondering if you can just help me understand to what extent is this being driven by a back-end loaded expectation around CapEx and how do we think about kind of the bit growth exiting next fiscal year? And I guess at what point, do you think you begin to start to outgrow bits relative to the industry for both DRAM and NAND?
Ernie Maddock: Yes. So, multipart question let me try and break it down in easily understandable way. First, as you pointed out, there is a time lag between the time CapEx is invested and the time that the bit growth is realized. And certainly, if you look at what we did in 2017 that was actually a function of the investments that we made in 2016 and it’s also important to remember that the bit growth that we were able to realize from the Inotera investments were not part of my current CapEx plan. And so if you add Micron’s spend and Inotera’s spend, you are probably in the upper $6 billion range and so that’s a good point of comparison as we now look at 2018. So in 2018, we would expect the majority of the bits that or the results of the CapEx to come on towards the latter part of the fiscal year. And you heard Sanjay in his prepared remarks say that we would be at bit crossover on an output basis for our 64-layer NAND around the second or third fiscal quarter of the year, but it was going to be the exit part of the calendar year for DRAM before we hit bit output crossover on 1x. So, that gives you some sense of the timing and the impact of timing on those investments. I would also tell you that our objective over a multiyear period is to grow at about industry levels. And certainly, we think this investment plan over the course of a multiyear horizon will allow us to do that, obviously, being above in 2017 fiscal as we have just reported DRAM at the low-end, little above on NAND. So I think looking at snapshot comparisons across our fiscal year is interesting, but really important is the segment that we intend to grow aligned with industry over the course of these multiyear periods. And I think that’s probably the best broad perspective I can provide, happy to address any specific question.
Sanjay Mehrotra: And of course, our focus also could be on high-value solutions, so that our revenue share outperforms our bit share.
John Pitzer: That’s helpful, guys. And then Sanjay just as my follow-on question, I think clearly, the most significant concern in the investment community is the sustainability of the current environment. So, I would love to kind of get your thoughts on sustainability. And I guess specifically to what extent in an environment like this, can you move the business from more sort of a transactional hand-to-mouth business to something that might have more backlog and visibility with your customers, especially as you try to move the mix towards more higher value end solutions?
Sanjay Mehrotra: In terms of the market environment, we are certainly excited about the demand requirements for DRAM as well as for NAND. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I mean, bit growth driver for DRAM certainly that’s outpacing the average growth of the industry is in the area of server and cloud. And here we are making great penetration with the hyperscale customers in terms of driving the growth of the DRAM business. So, we remain very bullish about the DRAM market environment through the 2017. We think it will be undersupplied. And given the demand trends, we think we will have healthy demand supply balance in DRAM throughout 2018 timeframe as well. And in terms of NAND as it’s well-known that average capacities are increasing certainly in mobile devices, but even more importantly, SSDs are displacing HDDs at the rapid pace with the attach rates continuing to be projected to be going up over the course of next several quarters. And of course, there is a strong value proposition for SSDs in the cloud and hyperscale data center environment as well given all the trends of artificial intelligence, machine learning, all of this is driving big data analytics. So, all these trends are related to artificial intelligence, bit growth in data customers wanting to offer differentiated value to their end customers, all of this is driving need for memory and storage solution and overall, we remain pretty bullish about the demand trends. I mean, if they look at DRAM as well as NAND even in autonomous vehicle, the demand requirements for flash, I mean data is being generated. So much data is being generated by autonomous vehicles that it requires fast processing both within the vehicle as well as on the cloud. So, I think demand trends for the foreseeable future continued to be strong and that bodes well for our industry. In terms of your question regarding customers and some of the customers wanting to engage in longer term requirements, yes, that is absolutely happening and we do consider that based on various customers. I mean, it depends on the nature of the customer’s requirements, really cannot get into the details of that here in this call, but certainly, our business includes customers that are more transactional in nature that have business more on a monthly transaction basis, some that are more on a quarterly basis and certainly certain customers that are also involved in longer term trends. I think customers are just seeing increasing value of memory and storage. I mean, this DRAM and flash is becoming strategic to our customers and our customers are seeing Micron as being uniquely positioned with having a strong portfolio of DRAM as well as flash and being the only company in the Western Hemisphere with those capabilities and that is definitely making us an attractive and valued partner to our customers.
John Pitzer: Thank you, guys. Congratulations again.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company.
Rajvindra Gill: Yes, thank you. I echo the congratulations. Question on the NAND bit growth, so the bit growth is increasing to 50% from kind of the high 30s this year, a lot of this obviously being driven by 3D NAND. Wanted to talk about in terms of how you are seeing the supply demand balance going into next year in the NAND environment and kind of your thoughts around pricing as we start to have more supply and the impact also to cost per bit?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, in terms of going in to 2018, we see healthy industry demand and supply balance for NAND. And you are right to note that the bit growth is going up because of the technology transition in the industry to the 64-layer technology. And when we look at the demand trends, those demand tends continue to be strong as I just pointed out related to SSDs as well as increasing average capacities of flash in mobile devices and all kinds of other devices. So, demand continues to be strong. We see healthy trends in that regard in 2018 timeframe. Regarding pricing, we don’t specifically for competitive reasons provide comments on pricing on the call, but we just like to point out that we believe that the healthy industry environment as one where price decline is less than or equal to cost declines and we are certainly focused on aggressively reducing our product cost with realizing successfully our technology production ramp of 64-layer.
Rajvindra Gill: Thanks. And just my follow-up, Sanjay, one of the positive trends that has been happening at Micron is the diversification of the end markets for DRAM and you could just compare this cycle say to previous cycles, maybe not just too long ago, but only about 3 years ago, where PCs were a higher percentage of DRAM and now they are mid-20% range today. So, can you talk about that phenomenon and you mentioned it in your prepared remarks, but the diversification of the end markets in DRAM specialty, particularly in graphics and automotive and server? How that is affecting the business model? How that is affecting the customer relationships and engagements going forward? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Certainly, the diversification of the end markets for DRAM absolutely bodes well for the future health of our business. We have enjoyed the benefits of that. Calendar year 2017 as you noted is a great example. And you just pointed out the mix of our DRAM business between PC what used to be just about PC and mobile is now very much about PC mobile, server, automotive and multitude of markets and Micron has really great presence, where variety of I mean whole slew of customers and channels. So, this really bodes well, plays very well to the strength of Micron. It has really for long time enjoyed diversified set of global customers and great presence in channels and that is coming into full play as the demand requirements for DRAM continue to grow nicely and into multiple mega-markets.
Rajvindra Gill: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Newman with Bernstein.
Mark Newman: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats again on the great results. My question is about the technology migration you talked about 64-year second crossover I believe second half FY ‘18. Can you talk about what’s next on NAND Flash 96-year or whatever it is and what the timing is? And will Micron look at transitioning to a charged flat flash alternative at 96-layer or perhaps one after that? And then similarly, for DRAM, what is the plan for 1Y and timing for EUV?
Sanjay Mehrotra: With respect to NAND in terms of our third-generation 3D NAND, we are not yet disclosing the number of layers in that technology. As I said in my prepared remarks, we are continuing to make good progress with that and we plan to be introducing that technology in the 2018 – calendar 2018 timeframe and continuing to deploy CMOS under the array technology that continues to provide Micron a die-sized leadership position, which is usually attractive to us [indiscernible] point of view. And with respect to DRAM in terms of 1Y node, we will be introducing that node also in calendar 2018 timeframe. And beyond that, we are not providing any specific details for our technology related to competitive basis. And your question regarding floating gate, we have a strong roadmap of future technologies related to floating gate.
Mark Newman: And then just a quick follow-up if I may, when do you think you will narrow the gap or catch up potentially with Samsung in both the NAND, 3D NAND and DRAM, I mean, I think that you have alluded before to closing the gap and narrowing the gap to zero hopefully eventually, I don’t think it’s happened yet. Is there an update on your thinking of when that could be?
Sanjay Mehrotra: As we have indicated before that in terms of technology cost position as well as the technology node readiness, in recent times over the course of last couple of years, Micron has lagged the competitor in terms of getting advanced technology ready at par with them and deploying those technologies into volume production. However, in recent times, Micron has made very good progress in this area and we are getting the benefit of that as we are ramping those technologies into production. I have said before that these kind of undertakings, driving, accelerated deployment of new technology nodes into volume production and continuing to narrow the gap on the cost front is a multiyear phenomena and we have made very good progress in this regard. I fully expect us to make – continue to make good progress in fiscal year 2018 as well. And we are of course very much focused on continuing to accelerate the timeline of our future technologies into production and then well positioned to ramp those technologies into volume production as well. And along with this of course remain very much focused on driving a greater mix of high-value solutions both in DRAM and NAND as well. So, these are really two very important pillars of our strategy driving cost competitiveness and driving greater mix of high value solutions and these things don’t happen overnight. They will continue to be strong growth opportunities for us going forward over the course of next few years.
Mark Newman: Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research.
Steven Fox: Thanks. Good afternoon. Two quick questions for me. First of all, you mentioned that as demand – your bit growth accelerates for NAND next year that you expect to capture some of the pent-up demand that the NAND market has seen. I guess, I was curious if you could talk about what gives you confidence that pent-up demand has naturally turned into demand destruction this year, why it will still be there? And then secondly, if I look at the CapEx breakdown that you provided, it looks like about $1.5 billion or so is dedicated towards product enablement. And I was just curious how that number compares to maybe a year ago and if there is anything you would say is most focused on? Thanks.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So, I will let Ernie comment on the CapEx, but on the demand side, as I pointed out earlier, I mean it’s not that this demand is perishable, I mean this demand in terms of the trend of SSDs replacing HDDs in client notebook computers where the attach rate continues to increase in 2017 attach rate of SSDs to PCs is around 35%. That attach rate over the course of next few years continues to grow to around 50% in 2018 and by 2020 timeframe expect it to go to around 75%. So, these demand trends are secular in nature. It’s the same thing on the enterprise side, again on the cloud side that the attach rate of SSDs as well as the average capacity requirements on our per-server basis continued to go up as well. So, these are really very solid secular trends here that are long-term in nature and of course the trends of mobile devices adding new rich features such as augmented reality, such as rich displays, all of these are trends that also continue to drive higher average capacities in mobile devices. So, I feel very good about the demand trends on the NAND side.
Steven Fox: Yes. And just to follow-up on the CapEx, if you look year-on-year, we just reported the totality of fiscal ‘17 and you would get a reasonably similar number within the ranges we provided. So there we would expect on a hard dollar basis perhaps $100 million to $200 million more in that enablement and technology piece of the business and that’s predominantly related to the centers of excellence that we have been talking about relative to wanting to consolidate a lot of our back-end operations very close to our front-end operations?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Yes, some of this product enablement CapEx is related to back-end captive assembly operations, which will help us improve our cost position going forward. And of course also there is CapEx associated with upgrading of the infrastructure that is needed to realize the technology transitions.
Steven Fox: Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citigroup.
Chris Danely: Hey, thanks guys. Can you just give us a little color on the, I guess the three market server mobile and PC on tightness, a relative tightness and how it trended during the quarter? And any information either qualitative or quantitative you have on inventory levels out there at the channel or customers just on DRAM?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Sure, Chris. So, I think as has been the case for a few quarters now, there is actually a fair amount of tightness across those three channels that you mentioned. So, it would be hard to distinguish one from the other relative to any nuances there. I don’t think there is an inventory issue certainly, if you actually take a look at inventory levels that are reported, which are typically financial numbers and adjust those for dollar cost of how pricing has changed over the course of the year. You do get a bit of a different perspective on inventory as reported by a variety of customers and channel partners in those areas, but the environment continues to be strong. The supply demand circumstances continue to be fairly tight and we are working very closely with our customers to make sure that we stay in close sync with them as they think about their plans going forward.
Chris Danely: Great, thanks. And for my follow-up question for Sanjay by the way, welcome to the DRAM party. You were not afraid to engage in M&A at your previous job, can you talk about the willingness or appetite for M&A at this point for Micron versus the desires to continue to improve the balance sheet?
Sanjay Mehrotra: We do not rule out M&A in the future. Right now, our focus is on the priorities that I mentioned that include cost competitiveness and strengthening the high-value mix in our revenue. And of course, if and when, we were to engage in M&, our focus would, of course we to try to strengthen our future opportunity and make it an opportunity that’s absolutely provides a strong ROI, beyond that I would not speculate in this matter.
Chris Danely: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen & Company.
Karl Ackerman: Hi, good morning, gentlemen. Ernie and Sanjay, I want to ask more of a strategic question. Two of your competitors in the NAND industry have been at disagreement on the trajectory of their manufacturing partnership. Are you and your existing NAND partner and client to abstain from future partnerships? And I have a follow-up please.
Ernie Maddock: I don’t think the experience that I think you are referring to colors our perspective on partnerships, that all partnerships are very individualized, partner specific set of activities and so certainly while we continue to become informed just as you do. Our color would be very specific to the circumstances at hand vis-à-vis any potential partnerships or the continuation of any content, any partnerships. And I think do you have a long history of valued partnerships here and annoying how to make the partnerships work well. So I mean partnerships are important.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Absolutely.
Karl Ackerman: Understand. Appreciate the color. I guess my final question, this was somewhat addressed earlier in call, I just want to move back to, just some of the content growth that we’ve have been talking about, but our fieldwork during the quarter indicated that DRAM fulfillment rates at least in the server market improved from last quarter, but they were still well below 100%. Are you seeing more active engagement today with Tier 2 customers for longer term contract agreements that gives you greater confidence in your capacity planning assumptions?
Sanjay Mehrotra: I mean, we are definitely seeing strong demand trends from – the entire spectrum of our customers a large what you would call Tier 1 or Tier 2 as you termed, although all customers are important to us and we do engage meaningfully with them and we work closely with them to understand their demand requirement and we apply our own judgment to their demand requirements as well in terms of assessing that overall industry demand trends. And based on those demand understanding of our – on behalf of our customers, we project healthy industry supply environment in DRAM and NAND.
Karl Ackerman: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho.
Vijay Rakesh: Thanks, guys. Congratulations on a great quarter. Just looking on the DRAM side, you mentioned the crossover of 1X nanometer, when do you expect to see that? And if you can give us some color on what the cost reductions are as you transition the mix to 1X?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Sure. So, we talked about being at bit output crossover for 1X DRAM by before the end of the calendar year of 2018. And then as we have previously shared for the 1X node, we see somewhere roughly 45% increase in bits per wafer versus 20 nanometer and about a 20 – to slightly more than 20% cost reduction on a cost per bit.
Vijay Rakesh: Great. Got it. And on the NAND side, obviously, pretty nice numbers on the storage business side, up 71%, but could you parse out how much is enterprise mix for you on NAND and obviously you guys are seeing some good traction there, where do you see enterprise mix exiting next year, let’s say? Thanks.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So we say that our SSD mix was about 20% of our NAND revenue and that consists of our sales of client, two client customers as well as to the hyperscale of cloud and enterprise customers. And both are roughly about the same in both of those categories. Beyond that, we don’t provide further breakdown.
Vijay Rakesh: Alright, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra with Baird.
Tristan Gerra: Hi, good afternoon. Looking at your production cost reduction timeline. Is it fair to assume that there is going to be some slowdown as you reach crossover for 64-layer in NAND meaning that after that there could be little bit of a slowdown in terms of your ability to use production costs? And then if you could reiterate the production cost reduction targets for NAND and DRAM for 2018?
Ernie Maddock: Sure. So, I think that in terms of Gen 3 NAND, we will certainly talk more about that as we are able to in terms of what we might expect and whatever is appropriate for that. So, it is true just on a mathematical basis that as you progress up layer count on an absolute basis, there are less incremental bits and there is an association between cost reduction and bit growth opportunity. But in terms of providing specifics, it’s very, very early to share that with you. And if you look at 64-layer versus the first generation, it’s somewhere in the realm as we have talked about before 2x the density in roughly an aggregate of 30% reduction in bit cost.
Sanjay Mehrotra: In general, the technology complexity increases where subsequent technology generations both in DRAM and NAND and also given the increased technology complexity, gigabytes or gigabits that you gain in NAND as well as DRAM on a per wafer basis tends to decline with advanced technology nodes. So, all of those factors play a role in terms of cost reduction capabilities as well going forward.
Tristan Gerra: Okay, great. And then a quick second question, so you talked about the adoption rate trajectory of SSDs in notebooks, could you also give us your expectation both now in say a year or two in terms of the adoption rate for SSDs in data center and traditional enterprise server?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Sure. I can do that. I just want to add a comment to the previous question on cost. My comment was related to cost on a per wafer gigabyte per wafer basis from one technology node to the next. Of course, cost also depends very much on how you deploy those technologies into volume production. And this is one of our focus areas in terms of deploying advanced technologies faster into production. Now, specific to your second question regarding the attach rates in enterprise and server markets, so SSD attach rate is around 50% there in terms of on a SSD per unit basis and opportunity there is greater. Average capacities are definitely moving fairly fast. In fact, enterprise and data center is one of the fastest growth segments for flash in terms of year-over-year bits demand increases that are projected. Average capacities in enterprise and data center for SSDs are over 3 terabyte. That’s average capacity and that trend continues to increase by some projections tripling almost to 9 terabyte by 2020 timeframe. So as I was saying earlier, I mean, these demand trends for increasing attach rate of SSDs in client and data center cloud computing applications as well as the increases in average capacities are secular trends.
Tristan Gerra: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Mike Delaney with Goldman Sachs.
Mike Delaney: Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. First question to follow-up on CapEx, I was hoping you could clarify the comment about no new wafer capacity additions. I know you said that explicitly for DRAM, but can you clarify if that also applies to NAND flash. And on that topic, if you could help us understand to what extent you may need to invest in new clean room capacity as part of that CapEx guidance obviously even without adding new wafer property that the amount of factory floor space is going up for both 1X nanometer and more so for 3D NAND. I know, the company had some available, but I am just wondering if any of the spending relates to clean room capacity due to the floor space requirements?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Yes, Mike. So, certainly the statement about no new wafer capacity in fiscal year ‘18 applies equally to both DRAM and NAND. And relative to your second question, there is not anything material relative to the CapEx guide that we shared that relates to construction costs or whatnot. As you pointed out, there is obviously incremental clean room space available or could be available at pretty low cost, but it would not be material in course of the overall guide that we provided.
Mike Delaney: Okay. And if I could sort of follow-up specifically on smartphone demand trends, if you could touch on what the company has seen in terms of end demand for some of the flagship models specifically? But also, if you could talk about some of the Chinese domestic OEMs, just trying to see any pickup in demand trends for memory from those customers?
Sanjay Mehrotra: I think in the flagship models, to answer your specific question, the demand for DRAM as well as for NAND, average capacities continues to go up. And of course, the mix of these high-end smartphones also as a part of the total smartphone market continues to go up. And specifically to DRAM, average capacities of DRAM in high-end smartphones going from somewhere over 3 gigabyte in 2017 projected to go up to over 5 gigabyte closer to 6 gigabyte by 2020 timeframe. And specifically to NAND, average capacities of NAND in high-end smartphones in 2017 is somewhere around 70 gigabyte, let’s say, projected to double – or more than doubled by 2020 timeframe as well. So, again, the average capacity increased trends in smartphones continues to be solid, not only actually in high-end smartphones, but in value segment of the smartphone market as well.
Mike Delaney: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I’d like to turn the floor back over to Micron for any closing comments.
Shanye Hudson: Thank you. That concludes our call today. We really appreciate your support. And as a reminder, we will be posting the prepared remarks from today’s call as well as a webcast replay on our website later this afternoon.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Shanye. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to be speaking with you for my first Micron quarterly earnings call and I'm particularly fortunate to be joining at a time when we are able to report record revenues and non-GAAP EPS. These results reflect healthy industry fundamentals, the strength of Micron's diversified technology and product portfolio and our broad customer reach. Micron also continues to make progress in improving its technology and product competitiveness. The current industry dynamic and the growing strategic importance of Micron's technologies and capabilities make this an exciting time to join the company. The unprecedented amount of data being created, stored and processed presents tremendous opportunities for Micron. Applications like autonomous driving, machine learning and big data analytics all promise to make an enormous impact on our lives. Memory and flash storage are the critical and increasingly strategic elements in every one of these applications. Market-leading companies from a broad array of industries who provide data center services, automotive applications and mobile solutions, just to name a few, are eager to partner with innovative companies like Micron that can provide leading-edge technology and systems solutions. Micron is uniquely positioned with the right technologies and capabilities to take a leadership position, and I'm delighted to have the opportunity to help the company maximize this potential. I will now share some details from each of our business units, followed by technology and operational highlights for the quarter. Finally, I'll share our perspective on current industry supply and demand dynamics. We had record revenues in all business units this quarter, nearly doubling our company level year-over-year revenue performance. In the Compute and Networking Business Unit, all segments posted significant gains from year ago levels. Revenue from cloud customers was more than four times higher year-over-year. And we saw increased enterprise demand as analytics workloads are driving more use of in-memory databases and higher server memory content. We continue to build upon our strong position in graphics and high performance memory technology, with shipments of our 12 gigabits per second GDDR5X, the industry's fastest discrete DRAM, which we successfully ramped to high volume during the quarter. Most CNBU revenue came from 20-nanometer DRAM products, and we also recognized initial revenue on our next generation 1X DDR4 products. Looking forward, we believe that we are well positioned to effectively serve both our traditional OEM customer base, as well as evolving opportunities around tailored solutions for large data center customers. Our Mobile Business Unit revenue increased slightly quarter-over-quarter with significant margin expansion, driven by lower costs associated with the continued shift to 20-nanometer LPD RAM and a favorable pricing environment. We expect increased demand ahead of anticipated flagship smartphone introductions planned for the fall. Requirements for multi-camera systems, augmented reality applications and high-resolution displays now dictate 4 and 6-gigabyte LPDRAM densities for a great user experience. This demand aligns well with our 20-nanometer and 1X offerings where we plan to introduce nearly 20 new 1X package-on-package variation in the next 12 months. We are focused on developing and diversifying our MCP and discrete NAND device offerings, which will position us to well to address the full range of smartphones, from basic entry level smartphones to content rich high-end devices. Many mobile OEM customers prefer MCPs in their design implementation to address their memory and storage requirements, as MCPs provide a single source for DRAM memory and NAND storage, simplifying system design, validation and supply chain considerations. We continue to sample our 32-layer MLC and TLC 3D NAND MCP, discrete UFS and e.MMC devices to both chipset partners and handset OEMs. Revenue shipments of these products will begin later in the second half of this calendar year following completion of qualifications by customers. Our Embedded Business Unit recorded a 44% increase in revenue year-over-year, driven by strong demand growth across all segments and a better pricing environment. We achieved record quarterly revenue for each of the automotive, consumer and connected home and industrial segments. We saw continued strength in automotive, DRAM and e.MMC NAND with the infotainment and instrument cluster applications driving this record level. We continue to maintain our strong market share leadership position in automotive, enabled by our focus on a high quality and deep customer relationships and support. Industrial and consumer connected home revenues were led by increased shipments into rapidly growing applications, such as voice-activated home assistance and set-top boxes. We continue to transition our non-automotive DRAM portfolio onto 20-nanometer designs. Our Storage Business Unit delivered record revenues as sales of our SSD products grew 33% quarter-over-quarter. Sales to cloud and enterprise SSD customers grew appreciably on a combined basis and exceeded revenue from client customers for the first time. The most significant growth came from our cloud customers, where revenue doubled quarter-over-quarter. Our SSD sales in the quarter were driven primarily by our SATA SSD solutions using our 32-layer TLC 3D NAND. During the quarter, we had first revenue shipments of our 8-terabyte SSD enterprise class SSD, which is an industry first. Several new OEM and hyperscale customer qualifications are underway for our SATA drives, and in calendar year 2018, we plan to introduce NVMe PCIe offerings using our 64-layer TLC 3D NAND. On the manufacturing operations front, we continue to make good progress toward achieving meaningful output by the end of our fiscal year on both our 64-layer 3D NAND and our 1X DRAM. Both of these technologies have already begun revenue shipments and are advancing well in their production yield ramp. We also continue to execute our plans to outfit our assembly operations as part of our DRAM center of excellence in Taiwan. These DRAM center, in addition to our NAND center of excellence in Singapore, will be essential to our ongoing efforts to optimize costs and improve our flexibility and speed to meet customer needs. On the technology front, we continue to make solid progress on the development of our third-generation 3D NAND and our next-generation 1y DRAM technologies. Our third-generation 3D NAND will continue to be based on our innovative CMOS-under-the-array architecture. This architecture, pioneered by Micron, provides the benefits of smaller die size and lower cost. We expect our 1y DRAM to further improve our competitive position in the industry. Looking at the industry broadly, Micron continues to see a healthy supply and demand environment that creates opportunities across both memory and storage markets. For calendar 2017, we expect DRAM industry bit supply growth of between 15% and 20%, slightly below our view of demand growth. For NAND, we expect 2017 industry supply growth in the high 30% to low 40% range, constraining what would otherwise be higher demand. We expect healthy industry demand to persist into 2018, supported by continued strong growth in both DRAM and NAND demand, reflecting broader trends in the data center and mobile markets, as well as increased adoption of SSDs across enterprise, cloud and client PCs. Finally, after my first two months at Micron, I would like to share some of my priorities. Our execution and competitiveness are my primary focus, particularly accelerating the ramp of new technologies into volume production and introducing new products quickly, both of which are essential to delivering innovative solutions at lower cost and strengthening Micron's business fundamentals. Micron has a tremendous portfolio of technologies and core capabilities. Our goal is to leverage these to provide high-value products and solutions that improve our revenue mix. We will target high growth opportunities and seek out partnerships with leading companies in the ecosystem to position Micron for long-term success. We are off to a good start. Our execution and the current business climate are creating more flexibility, which we are leveraging to solidify our foundation through technology, product and manufacturing investments, while also strengthening our balance sheet. I believe that through focus and solid execution, Micron can capitalize on the world's increasing reliance on memory and storage solutions. I’ll now turn it over to Ernie, who will walk through the specifics of our financial performance this quarter.
Ernest Maddock: Thank you, Sanjay. We had a strong quarter with record revenue, non-GAAP EPS and operating cash flow, driven by the continued positive industry environment, additional bit growth from our current technologies and progress on deploying our next-generation technologies into manufacturing. I will provide an overview of the fiscal Q3 results by technology and business unit, followed by comments on our overall corporate financial performance and guidance for F 'Q4. DRAM represented 64% of our total revenue with the following segmentation: Mobile was in the mid 20% range. PC was in the low 20% range, down from the prior quarter. Server represented approximately 30%, up from 25% the prior quarter, and specialty DRAM, which includes networking, graphics, automotive and other embedded technologies, was in the mid 20% range. Our trade NAND revenue represented 31% of total revenue with the following segmentation. Consumer, which consists primarily of component sales to partners and customers, was approximately 40%. Mobile, which includes managed NAND discrete solutions and the majority of our MCPs, was in the mid-teens percent range. SSDs were in the mid 20% range, up slightly from last quarter, and automotive, industrial and other embedded applications were in the high-teens percent range. Turning to performance by business unit. The Compute & Networking Business Unit reported fiscal Q3 revenue of $2.4 billion, up 25% sequentially due to increased bit shipments, ongoing success in penetrating growing segments like enterprise, graphics and high-performance memory and cloud and a stronger pricing environment. Non-GAAP operating income was $1.2 billion or 51% of revenue, up from 38% to prior quarter. 20-nanometer products were greater than half of CNBU revenue and were shipped primarily in the enterprise, cloud and client segments. Revenue growth in the enterprise segment was driven by the continued expansion of DRAM content per server. And in the cloud space, we experienced good sequential bit growth. Both segments also benefited from the current pricing environment. We saw ongoing growth of our 20-nanometer DDR4 products with particular strength coming from the latest industry server platforms. In networking, we saw shipment and revenue growth bolstered by the continued transition to 20-nanometer, 4-gigabit DDR3 and 8-gigabit DDR4 products. We also continue to see strong interest in our high-performance memory portfolio. This strength was primarily evident in data center networking equipment. Double-digit client revenue growth was driven by a continued firm pricing environment and product mix optimization, resulting in modestly declining bit shipments. Our 1X nanometer revenue was predominantly in this segment. Graphics also saw double-digit revenue growth, driven by strength in the game console market, as well as new PC graphics card product launches, including the G5X-based Titan Xp from NVIDIA. The Mobile Business Unit delivered fiscal Q3 revenue of $1.1 billion, up 4% sequentially, driven primarily by a stronger pricing environment and our non-GAAP operating income was $304 million or 27% of revenue, up from 16% to prior quarter. The embedded business unit delivered fiscal Q3 revenue of $700 million, up 19% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating income was $256 million or 37% of revenue, up from 33% the prior quarter. The results were driven by strong bit demand and increased average selling prices of DRAM, combined with record shipments of SLC and MLC NAND in the consumer and connected home segments and record shipments of DRAM and eMMC NAND into the industrial and automotive segments respectively. The Storage Business Unit delivered fiscal Q3 revenue of $1.3 billion, up 26% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating income was $276 million or 21% of revenue, up from 7% the prior quarter. The results were primarily driven by strong unit growth of SSDs and a stronger pricing environment. Moving to overall company results. Revenue for the third fiscal quarter was $5.6 billion, up 20% sequentially and driven by primarily stronger DRAM ASPs and higher NAND bit volumes. On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased 92%, primarily due to a stronger DRAM pricing environment, increased bit volumes in both DRAM and NAND and our focus on higher value-add solutions to improve our product mix. Examples of this improved mix includes SSDs where year-on-year revenue tripled, while in DRAM bits embedded in high-value solution for enterprise, cloud and graphics customers, together grew at a rate twice our overall DRAM bit output for the same period. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 48%, up from 38.5% in the prior quarter, driven by increased DRAM ASPs and cost per bit reductions in both DRAM and NAND. On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP gross margin increased 30 percentage points, driven by a stronger DRAM pricing environment, a better product mix and lower cost per bit in both DRAM and NAND. Non-GAAP net income was $1.9 billion or $1.62 per share. Turning to results by product line. DRAM revenue increased 20% compared to the prior quarter as a result of a 5% increase in bit shipments and a 14% increase in ASPs. DRAM non-GAAP gross margins for the third quarter increased 10 percentage points sequentially to 54%, driven by a 6% cost per bit reduction and better product mix. As a reminder, we noted last quarter that second half fiscal year 2017 DRAM bit output would be about 10% higher than first half fiscal year 2017. As we look forward into fiscal 2018, the timing of the 1x technology transition is expected to result in our bit growth at or slightly below industry growth rates over the same period. We consider this bit growth pattern when we provided our 2 year bit growth CAGR earlier this year. Trade NAND revenue increased 21% compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting a 17% increase in bit shipments and a 3% increase in ASPs. Non-GAAP gross margin was 41%, up 10 percentage points, driven by a 12% cost per bit reduction and better product mix. As a reminder, we noted last quarter that second half fiscal year 2017 bit growth would be about 30% above first half fiscal year 2017. Based on the timing of technology transitions, we foresee relatively muted bit growth in the first half of fiscal 2018 follow by stronger growth in the second half. Consistent with DRAM, we considered this bit growth pattern when we provided our 2 year bit growth CAGRs earlier in the year. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $600 million, down $12 million from the prior year quarter. The company generated operating cash flow of $2.4 billion in fiscal Q3 compared to $389 million in the year ago period. During the quarter, we deployed $1.3 billion for capital expenditures, net of partner contributions and free cash flow for the quarter was $1.1 billion as we retired approximately $1 billion of debt via a tender offer for certain of our high-yield notes. We currently expect fiscal year 2017 free cash flow of approximately $3 billion and continue to prioritize the deployment of our cash flow toward advancing our production technology capabilities and reducing our debt. For fiscal year 2017, we are trending to the upper end of our indicated net CapEx range of $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion. We will provide a fiscal year 2018 CapEx perspective later this year. We ended the third quarter with cash, marketable investments and restricted cash of approximately $4.9 billion. Our guidance for fiscal Q4 is informed by our view of sustained, healthy supply and demand dynamics, our ongoing work around cost reduction and the improvement of our product mix. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following, revenue in the range of $5.7 billion to $6.1 billion, gross margin in the range of 47% to 51%, operating expenses between $575 million and $625 million, and operating income ranging between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion. EPS will range between $1.73 and $1.87 per share, based on 1,179 billion [ph] diluted shares. At our Analyst Day in February, we outlined how our production technology execution and the results in bit growth and cost reductions have enabled us to significantly strengthen our cash flow and financial performance in any market conditions. We've been reporting our incremental progress each quarter. However, I wanted to share the tremendous progress we've made over the 12-month period ending in fiscal Q3. During that time, our bit output has been above industry average for both DRAM and trade NAND and our cost per bit has declined approximately 25% and 30% in those technologies respectively. In addition, we continue to improve our competitiveness by successfully delivering solutions to deliver higher value-add opportunities. Our ability to deliver these results has enhanced our energy and excitement to make further progress, and we look forward to sharing that with you. With that, I will turn it back to Sanjay.
Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Ernie. Last week we announced that Sumit Sadana joined Micron as Executive Vice President and Chief Business Officer, a role that unites our four business units and our strategy and business development team into a single organization. This structure will better equip us to align our product strategies to market trends and customer demands.  Sumit brings nearly three decades of industry experience. He is a proven leader in driving strategy and building businesses with the focus on high-value profitable growth. Sumit has a successful track record at multiple large technology companies, and his perspective and expertise make him an ideal fit for Micron. Earlier this week, we also announced that Jeff VerHeul joined Micron as Senior Vice President of Non-Volatile Engineering. Jeff has extensive experience in leading the development of advanced semiconductor products, including flash system-level solutions. I look forward to Jeff's contributions in advancing Micron's roadmap of flash memory technology and value-added products. We welcome both Sumit and Jeff to Micron. Finally, I would like to extend gratitude to my predecessor, Mark Durcan. His dedication and leadership has positioned Micron well for this next chapter of success. As I have toured Micron’s facilities and met with leaders and teams throughout the company and have begun to engage with some of our customers. I have been impressed by the strength of our technologies, scale, customer reach and innovative hard working spirit of our global team. My experience since joining Micron has reinforced what I have known for a long time. This company has tremendous potential and can become one of the world's most successful semiconductor companies. I'm proud to be part of this iconic company. We will now open for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the solid quarterly execution. Sanjay, welcome to the team. First question is for you. At the time that SanDisk was acquired by Western Digital, SanDisk had a number two position in the global SSD markets, strong number three position in enterprise SSD, I think you were growing that business about 15% to 20% year-over-year. If I look at the most recent market share stats, you know, Micron is sitting at about a number 5 market share position in both total SSD and enterprise SSD market share. So in what areas does the Micron team really have to focus on in order to drive leadership position in SSD, especially enterprise, is it systems capability, firmware, controller, OEM and cloud relationships and more importantly, what are you going to do to start to enable this?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Well, Micron team actually has over already been, as we said in our remarks, working on driving high-value solutions mix to greater levels in its portfolio. The company has made strong progress over a couple of quarters in client SSDs, as well as enterprise and cloud SSDs. And if you look at some of the market share numbers you will see that the market share over last couple of quarters has increased meaningfully. The market shares in enterprise, cloud stands at sub-10% levels and in client markets for SSDs, the market share is in high single digits at this point. So, all this definitely points to a much greater opportunity for the company in the times ahead. And key things that we had to focus on, this is absolutely an area of my priority here, is to increase the mix of system-level solutions in the NAND portfolio of the company. Things that have been going well, continue to build on them but expand, diversify our capabilities, our product portfolio and deepen our customer engagement. The thing that's really, really powerful for Micron here is that Micron has strong position in DRAM as well as NAND. And basically on the continent, this is the only company that has these strong capabilities. Therefore, customers are very much engaged with us in helping us drive the strength in the system level solutions on the NAND side. In the areas where we have to focus on, to answer your question further are certainly continue to strengthen our controller capabilities, as well as firmware capabilities. Today, some of them – most of them are based on external controllers and we have a roadmap of both, external and internal controllers going ahead. So, these will be an important area of focus for the company going forward.
Harlan Sur: Great. Thank you. And then, Ernie, for you on the gross margin front, you know, solid job over the team - by the team over the past few quarters. Going forward, you're looking for about another 100 basis points of improvements. The demand environment is shaping up to be stronger second half over first half. Supply outlook still seems pretty disciplined, and the team is doing a great job on driving the cost curves. So it seems like your gross margin expansion should be greater than the implied 100 basis points you're guiding to. Are there any mix-related impacts in Q4 which is holding back the margin profile?
Ernie Maddock: I don't think so. I think it's a function of pattern of our bit growth over the course of this year. So while we will continue to enjoy cost reduction in the final quarter of this fiscal year, it's going to be likely a bit of a slower rate than we've experienced for the first part of the year. And also as we look at the pricing environment, you know, we continue to view supply and demand in a favorable way. But bear in mind, we've now have had several consecutive quarters of nice quarter-over-quarter step-ups. And it isn't always advisable to bank on continued aggressive quarter-on-quarter pricing increases as you think about the business.
Harlan Sur: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely from Citi.
Wayne Low: Hello. This is Wayne Low in for Chris Danely. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the quarter. Can you talk about any changes you are seeing in the server demand trends, is it possible that we'll see allocation or lead time expansion in this market?
Sanjay Mehrotra: The server demand definitely continues to be strong for DRAM. If you look at the growth for DRAM content combined with the unit server increases, the growth - bit growth rate that we are looking at for the industry is about 40% on a year-over-year basis. So this is really high-value segment of the market. And certainly as we know, that industry in 2017 is experiencing overall tightness on the DRAM side, driven primarily by the strong growth on markets such as server, as well as other markets like mobile continuing to be very strong, where the average capacities of DRAM content is increasing, you know, given all the features that the phones are implementing, and even markets like automobile where DRAM content continues to increase nicely. So the demand trends are being driven by multiple markets. Certainly server is the highest growth trend in the marketplace today. And that's all for the DRAM side of the business.
Wayne Low: Okay. Can I ask you just for a little bit more color on what you are seeing on as far as handset demand trends? What has the impact been from the China inventory correction? And also what do you anticipate the impact would be of high-end SKUs of flagship phones being delayed?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So I think when you look at the content of DRAMs in the mobile market, it really continues to increase nicely going in value smartphones from about a little over gigabyte per phone to about doubling by 2018 timeframe, so continued strong growth in terms of average capacity. And the same trend is certainly happening on the high end phones too, where you are starting to see 4- and 6-gigabyte DRAM content. And certainly on the multi-chip packages also, we are seeing high DRAM content, as well as high-NAND content being driven in the mobile phone market. So overall when you look at year-over-year trends in 2017, as well as when you look at the trajectory in 2018, mobile does continue to be a strong market. Certainly, there can be periods where there can be some inventory adjustments in certain parts of the market, but important thing to focus on is really the long-term trend. And that trend, due to all the features that are being implemented, even in the entry-level smartphones and certainly on the high-end smartphones are tending to drive higher average content and demand growth for DRAM, as well as for NAND.
Wayne Low: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks very much for taking the questions. First question is on DRAM ASPs. On the last earnings call the company commented about how some of the contracts that have been in place for a while - haven't caught up with the substantial increase in spot pricing. And I'm wondering to what extent you expect a similar dynamic to play out as you think about the August quarter?
Ernie Maddock: I think as I have mentioned in my earlier remark, we are still seeing some adjustments upward in certain segments of the market, certainly in terms of both frequency and magnitude. Those were a little less than we've experienced in the prior few quarters, Mark.
Mark Delaney: Okay. That's helpful. And then for follow-up question, the NAND gross margins expanded very significantly and the company did very well on the cost per bit reduction, down 12% quarter-on-quarter. I know, Ernie, you said we shouldn't expect cost reductions to come every quarter at those sorts of rates. But it seems like the company is on track to exceed the 20% to 25% cost target that have guided for the NAND business for this year. And I just wondered to what extend you think you have the ability to exceed that prior guidance, given how much you've already accomplished or is there maybe other factors like mix that we need to keep in mind for the August quarter on the NAND business on cost?
Ernie Maddock: Yes, I think it's important to remember that, that cost reduction was a 2 year CAGR. And certainly you'd expect with the kind of bit growth that we've experienced in our fiscal ‘17, that you would be at the upper end or above the upper end of that range. And if you go back and look at our fiscal ‘16, we were below. So it's important to blend those two years together, but the answer would get you to fairly significant cost reductions this year, commensurate with the type of bit growth that we've spoken of.
Mark Delaney: Understood. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo.
David Wong: Thanks very much. Can you give us a bit more detail on 3D NAND, the third generation versus the second generation? You've somewhat answered this in terms of the cost. But just looking specifically at third and second generation, how much cost savings do you get, reduction in cost per bit and does third generation have more layers or a narrower line width or both?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So regarding the third generation, we will provide you more details as we get closer to production of that technology, obviously for competitive reasons.
David Wong: Okay, fine. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.
Kevin Cassidy: Thanks for taking my question. And congratulations on the great results. Can you say what's happening with your contract periods? It used to be PC DRAMs were negotiated every two weeks. I'm sure that customers are asking for extensions on those contracts. Can you just say in general what's your average contract time now?
Ernie Maddock: So there hasn't been a significant change during this period of time. Typically as you noted, PC DRAM contracts are the shortest, you know, we would actually say maybe a little longer than 2 weeks, but certainly roughly in the realm of a month or so. And then the other technologies tend to go up from there. But we haven't seen any material change in the duration as a result of the current market environment. Although, there may be some requests for that, it's typically not something that gets changed very much over the course of the cycle.
Kevin Cassidy: Okay. Great. And maybe just if you can give us your views adding more DRAM wafer capacity, what would stimulate that or what would be your decision to ever add wafer capacity on DRAM?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Our focus in DRAM is to continue to advance our technology and to ramp the new technology nodes into production as rapidly as we can, keeping in mind our customer requirements and there of course qualification of products built using those technologies. And we’re always keeping an eye on overall demand and supply balance and our own demand and supply balance as well. So basically prudent focus on supply growth management. But the primary focus, the one that provides highest return on investments is around technology transitions and that's where really all our priorities will be. In terms of any new capacity, I mean we would certainly have to first make sure that we have captured the maximum potential of our technology transition capability in manufacturing. And then we’ll have to certainly see that there is sustained projection of sustained demand growth in the years ahead before we consider adding new capacity.
Kevin Cassidy: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie.
Srini Pajjuri: Thank you. Hi, guys. A question on the PC segment, Ernie, I think you said PC's down. I just want to make sure it's not down in absolute terms. It doesn't look like it, I just want to make sure. And then if can you comment on what sort of demand trends you are seeing in the PC and also the pricing trends last quarter?
Ernest Maddock: Sure. So Sanjay may team up for this. But relative to the gigs shift or volume shift into the PC segment, as we said in our prepared remarks, we did have a slight decline in unit volume. It wasn't very significant at all, but that was part of our plan to address higher value-added markets. I don't think it was reflective of a decreased demand environment in any way, shape or form. We don't typically comment on the going forward pricing environment, other than the general statement that we see fairly good balance between supply and demand. And we're going to continue to monitor that segment quite carefully from a bit growth perspective. I think we're thinking that that segment would somewhere be in the range of plus low to mid-single digits in aggregate for us in fiscal '17 and I think that that addresses the three points you raised but if not, please let us know.
Srini Pajjuri: Yeah. That's great. That's helpful. And then in terms of the cash usage, Ernie, I think in the past, you said it's mostly your top priority is to pay off the debt or at least reduce the debt load, and obviously, a very strong free cash flow here. And then, given Sanjay's comments about the enterprise SSD focus, et cetera, I’m just focus as to if and where M&A might come in, if I kind of take a longer-term view here? Thank you.
Ernest Maddock: In terms of driving our growth ahead, of course, we have several tools available to us. Our technology and product capabilities, our engagement with customers and our ability on the manufacturing side in terms of implementing the new technologies into production. We would never rule out any M&A, if and when appropriate, we would absolutely consider it, but it would have to be something that does provide ROI. So we just want to make sure that we focus on our priorities. And our priorities at this point are to strengthen our strategy and product execution and increasing the mix of high-value solutions in our portfolio mix, while engaging with customers on defining the future generation architectures. So again, I don't rule out any M&A, but it of course always has to be considered in the context of what value it brings and what ROI it brings.
Srini Pajjuri: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah of Nomura Instinet.
Romit Shah: Yeah. Thank you. Ernie, just on OpEx it's been coming in lower than anticipated, I think for a few quarters and in light of kind of your new product strategies and the upcoming fiscal year, can you give us just an advice on how to think about OpEx?
Ernest Maddock: We've mentioned earlier in the year that one of the biggest variables in terms of the quarterly level of OpEx is something we call pre-qual expense. So as we are going through the process of qualifying either new packages or new technologies for customers those carry with them significant expenses. When we went into this fiscal year, we suggested that they would be more heavily weighted toward the front part of the first year and you've seen that play out here as our operating expenses have flattened out. As we look forward, we're considering OpEx as part of our fiscal year 2018 planning process and we're not quite through that. So I think we'll be in a position to share a little bit more color on that with you on the next call. But we are, as always, very mindful of operating expenses and operating expense progression. So we're taking a very close look at that.
Romit Shah: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then, Sanjay, when the announcement was made that you were joining, I think, some of us, at least the initial reaction was that, yeah, there's a lot of potential to improve the mix within NAND. So sort of seeing consumer at 40% of the business, SSDs kind of in the mid-20s, where do you think you can take the mix of business within NAND and how long would it take for you to get it to where you want?
Sanjay Mehrotra: So at this point, we're not prepared to really lay out mix targets for the future. But I can certainly tell you that indeed there is great opportunity over time to strengthen the mix of the managed NAND solutions, that means SSDs, as well as in the mobile space, things like eMMC, UFS and MCP. And again, I would like to point out that there is a large part of mobile market, which demands MCP, and Micron is very well-positioned with this mix of DRAM and flash. So we will definitely focus on bringing up solution, more MCP solutions using our eMMC and UFS capabilities in the future. I would like to point out that these kind of transitions do take a period of time. Micron is, I would say, still in the early days of implementing this transition. Over extended period of time we definitely will be driving the mix. But it really has excessive focus of the entire leadership team here. And with the hire of Jeff VerHeul, we have certainly double down in this area in terms of focusing further on system level solutions for NAND.
Romit Shah: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next…
Sanjay Mehrotra: As you know, I will also just add that in terms of the components side of things, that includes some of the sales that the company makes to Intel, which as you know is our partner in terms of development, so that's part of that component mix that you were talking about as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.
Blayne Curtis: Thanks for taking my question. Ernie, I just wanted to go back to a prior answer you had. When you look obviously, I feel bad asking, your cash flow obviously has grown hugely in the last couple of quarters. I mean, if you look at this the cash in the next fiscal year, it wasn't that long ago people were asking how you're going to pay for CapEx and now your flush [ph] with cash. So just kind of curious your thought process, you pulled in a little in terms of transitions, but it’s only $200 million, just kind of you weight those options in terms of faster transitions, capacity adds, buybacks, as well as the debt retirement, which you did this quarter?
Ernest Maddock: Sure. So consistent with one of the earlier answers, we are in the middle of our planning process for fiscal ’18 and certainly as we look at some of the priorities of the company, they have always been highly centered around continuing to drive our costs down. So, despite the fact that we have been, to some degree, mindful of in the context of the cash flow of the company in the past, we’re going to continue to do the right thing and be prudent and disciplined in that regard. We have ample opportunity to reduce the debt profile of the company. So I appreciate your thinking we're flush with cash. We're still not as flush as I would like to be. So that's going to continue to be a priority of – about generating that free cash flow, as well as reducing the debt. So consistent with our prepared remarks, those are the two things we're focused on. And you will continue to see us be very thoughtful in how we pursue both of those here as we enter our fiscal year 2018.
Blayne Curtis: Excellent. And I just want follow-up on the computing strength in terms of next platform from Intel has more, maybe talk about that as demand driver, and did that contribute, did you see anything in terms of the build ahead of that launch, which is more second half of this calendar year?
Ernest Maddock: We certainly do think that that will, as it gets launched it will be driving greater demand, certainly for bits, yes.
Blayne Curtis: Is that more – did you see any contribution yet or is it something that would be more next fiscal year?
Ernest Maddock: I would expect it to be increasing over time.
Blayne Curtis: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with MS.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you. Just following on the last question, in terms of CapEx trajectory, you've talked about a long-term number that sort of – it will be centered around 30% of sales, I believe. And I'm just curious, Sanjay, maybe changing some of the priorities and things like that, is that still the, without getting into the ‘18 plan that's not done yet, is that still the ballpark we should be thinking about long-term?
Ernest Maddock: I think it's important to remember that was a long-term target, and that there are years where we've been below, there are other years where we've been above. And so I don't know that relative to a long-term target that we would be prepared to be making any changes at this point. But by the same token - and if we do, certainly as we did earlier last year, will share that with you. But at present time that target remains the same. Bear in mind that it is a long-term target.
Sanjay Mehrotra: And I would agree with Ernie that the long-term target here is definitely I think very appropriately placed.
Joe Moore: Okay. Thanks for that. And then the growth that you saw in your compute and networking when you talked about quadrupling year-on-year in cloud, I guess, that number surprise me a little bit. And how much of that do you think is sort of Micron improving penetration versus things like memory content going up, just help us understand how that number's so good year-on-year? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra: I think it's obviously a combination of both that we've been saying for some time, Joe, that this is a priority of the company to really become stronger in segments where we have the opportunity to develop deeper relationships, offer higher value add, more sustained customer relationships and I think we've done a great job at executing on that strategy. So while there is absolutely benefit from prizing, absolutely, we enjoyed the same benefit that others did. From the average content increase, I think we enjoyed a disproportional benefit by executing on our strategy, addressing these markets in ways that allow us to get deeper penetration.
Joe Moore: Great. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer: Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions. Sanjay, my first question is when you think about sort of the consensus view on long-term NAND demand it's fairly bullish, which makes sense given the SSD story. But when you think about the long-term view of DRAM demand, I think it's less sanguine. I think the view is sort of PC units start really growing, handset units probably not growing all that much. I'm just kind of curious though, when you think about these applications like data analytics, AI, maybe level four, level five autonomous driving, is there a bottoms-up argument to have a more bullish long-term view on DRAM demand? And I’d be kind of curious because the consensus is sort of 15% to 20%, might be the long-term big growth, which would be well below sort of the historic level. I'd love to get your view, and if it's greater than 15% to 20%, is that something that's going to require more than just technology transitions to support?
Sanjay Mehrotra: Certainly, we have, I believe, strong opportunities in technology transition to meet the future growth expectations. As I said in a response to an earlier question as well that we definitely will have to be exploiting that fully before we would ever consider any capacity additions. And you are certainly right, that the demand drivers certainly are the DI, the machine learning with so much data being generated and all of that data require to be processed fast to provide – its great experience for consumers, as well as bring great value to businesses to enable and unleash the application. This is all the AI in the technology space. It's just extremely early days and extremely dynamic and definitely memory and storage will become, I believe, a key enabler for the capabilities that AI technology would be able to enable in multitude of applications, whether it is autonomous driving or it is cloud computing in variety of applications here. So, yes, I mean, the demand outlook here certainly is very interesting, but again, we just do not want to be getting ahead of ourselves. I think it is important that we stay focused on continuing to drive the business with focus on prudent supply growth here.
John Pitzer: That's helpful. And then Ernie, as my follow-up, I know you don't want give us quarter-by-quarter mix targets. But I'm kind of curious, as you sort of exit the back half of this fiscal year where you're outgrowing industry bits in both NAND in DRAM, and you move into next year where you'll be under growing. Could you help us just kind of frame, is there enough sort of mix up opportunity during the first half ‘18 where even though you might be losing some bit share, you might not be losing sort of profit share in the industry? How do we think about where you are on that mix optimization curve?
Ernest Maddock: Well, I think as we noted, we are making progress every single quarter with penetrating higher value-added solutions. And we would expect, if we are successful in continuing to execute on that, that we would be in a position to have greater revenue from those segments which may, depending on the pricing environment, to some degree mitigate a little bit the bit growth profile. But bear in min, John, that we talked about our bit growth in context of an industry that we were estimating. But we also used the words at or slightly below, not materially below. So I do think it's important to keep that in mind. And on the NAND front, we just simply said we would have a little slower growth in the first half of the year versus the second half of the year. I wouldn't expect that we were going to be dramatically different or so underperforming the industry that it would disadvantage the company.
John Pitzer: Helpful. Thanks, Ernie.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer with Summit Redstone.
Jagadish Iyer: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions, Ernie and Sanjay. First, if you go from 20-nanometer to 18-nanometer in the case of DRAM and as well as 32 to 64 layer in case of 3D NAND, we just want to understand, what kind of cost reduction should we be thinking about and how was the trajectory as we look to calendar ‘18? And then I have a follow up.
Sanjay Mehrotra: So as you look through calendar 2018, we will certainly be continuing to ramp our 1x DRAM technology as well as our 64 layer technology during the course of that timeframe. We are still in early stages. As we said, we'll be achieving meaningful output of both 1x, as well as 64 layers this quarter here. But we continue to be ramping it during the course of next several quarters. In terms of the bit growth, 20-nanometer provided something like, let's say, 40%, slightly greater than that in terms of bit growth compared to the prior node and gave us a cost reduction of more than 20%. And then we look at 1x compared to 20-nanometer, that's also in that same range, although 1x gives us somewhat greater cost reduction than 20-nanometer node give us over the prior 25-nanometer node. And when we go from to 32-layer compared to the planer NAND that we had - here we had at Micron, the last edition of planar NAND, 32-layer gave us bit growth in volume die of about 100% or so and gave us a cost reduction of greater than – in the range of maybe sub-30%. And going from 32-layer to 64-layer bits gained is also about 100% and cost reduction going from 32-layer to 64 layer is also. At mature yields, comparing mature yields to mature yield and high volume wafer product to high volume product, 32 layer to 64 layer will also give us about a 30% cost reduction. So a Micron has been really well positioned in NAND with the 32-layer technology, which has given it meaningful cost reduction over our last planar node and 64-layer continues that trend ahead as well.
Ernest Maddock: And Jagadish just add to that, I would refer you back to some of the 2 year cost reduction CAGR we've provided at our Analyst Day, which gives you a view of fiscal ‘17 and ‘18 together. So that might be helpful to you as well as you think about that.
Jagadish Iyer: Okay. That's very helpful. And finally, I just want to understand your thoughts on the DRAM channel inventory level at this point of time? Thank you.
Ernest Maddock: We think that the channel inventories are well within the range that we would considered to be normal. Certainly, they have improved from a quantity point of view over the first part of this year when they were extremely, extremely short. But in aggregate, I think that - we think that channel inventory levels are still within healthy ranges.
Sanjay Mehrotra: And I just want to add a comment to my response before to you, your question was very specific in terms of cost reductions between technology nodes on high-volume products essentially. And that - those numbers should not be confused with year-over-year cost reductions. Because year-over-year cost reductions on the overall blend of the business are very much a function of the technology mix that is in production. And as I indicated, these technologies will be gradually ramping up for us in production over the course of next several quarters, while the older technologies will still continue to be in production to meet our overall diversified customer requirements for diversified mix of technology and product and solutions.
Jagadish Iyer: Thanks so much for that. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we have time for one more question. Our final question for today comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead.
C.J. Muse: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. I guess first question. Could you share your initial thoughts on what your outlook is for DRAM supply for the industry in calendar '18? And as part of that for 1x, when do you expect to reach a crossover point?
Ernest Maddock: You know C.J., we think the industry for calendar '18 could be slightly higher than the range of growth in calendar '17 which is 15% to 20%. So maybe add a couple of percentage points to either end of the range. And we haven't shared yet bit crossover for 1x. We've said we have meaningful output by end of fiscal year. We're clearly on track to do that and we'll provide more perspective on that as we more fully describe our 2018 plans.
C.J. Muse: That's helpful. And then I guess a quick follow-up on CapEx, you said you are going to spend towards the higher end of the range, so roughly 300 plus give or take million. Is that more DRAM or NAND, can you share what that spending is and is that translating to more bits or does it relate to rising capital intensity?
Ernest Maddock: So just to make sure we're on the same page, we have given a range this year of $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion. And we said we were trending toward that $5.2 billion range. So it's just a couple of hundred million dollars. And I would say that really there is no specific area that I would point you toward. It's just doing what we need to do to make sure we are well set up here as we exit the end of the fiscal year.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's Micron Technology's third quarter 2017 financial release conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Latif and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Micron Technology second quarter 2017 financial release conference call. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Ivan Donaldson. Sir, you may begin your conference.
Ivan Donaldson: Thank you, Latif and welcome to Micron Technology's second quarter fiscal 2017 financial conference call. On the call with me today are Mark Durcan, CEO and Director and Ernie Maddock, Chief Financial Officer. This conference call, including audio and slides, is also being webcast from our Investor Relations website at investors.Micron.com.

Today's call will be approximately 60 minutes in length. A webcast replay will be available on our website for one year. We encourage you to monitor our website at Micron.com through the quarter for the most current information on the Company, including information on the various financial conferences that we will be attending. You can also follow us on Twitter @MicronTech. As a reminder, the matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ material from statements made today. We refer you to the documents the Company's files with the SEC, specifically our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, for a complete discussion of the important risk factors and other risks that may affect our future results. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. We're under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after today's date to conform these statements to actual results. I'll now turn the call over to Mark.
Mark Durcan: Thanks Ivan. For fiscal Q2 2017, Micron posted total revenue of $4.65 billion with non-GAAP gross margin of 38.5% and net income of $1.03 billion or $0.90 per share. Revenue was at the top of our guidance while gross margin, operating income and earnings per share exceeded projections. Operating cash flow was $1.8 billion. Last quarter, we provided detailed insight on industry pricing dynamics, explaining how the significant increases over trough pricing for PC DRAM far exceeded what we had seen in other segments which typically react more slowly. This quarter, we saw continued gains in client DRAM pricing but also benefited from increases in mobile, cloud and enterprise pricing as well. All of these segments showed meaningful quarter-over quarter increases. These gains, combined with outstanding progress on cost reductions, led to a significant increase in our DRAM margins. In NAND, we were able to capitalize on an increasing percentage of low-cost 3D TLC NAND by more fully participating in the SSD market. As a result, while blended ASPs were down slightly due to a higher density product mix, our NAND margins improved substantially over last quarter. As we noted in our February analyst conference, we continue to see broad industry trends placing increasing value on the memory and storage technologies we develop and the features those product -- those technologies can provide. In the most recent quarter, you can see that reflected in significant increases in cloud and enterprise businesses, both in bits shipped and value of products going to those segments and in an ongoing preference for SSDs over HDDs in storage platforms. We'll comment more on this when we walk through the specific business details in a moment. From a supply and demand perspective, we continue to be comfortable with market dynamics given the capacity plans we're aware of today. I'll now provide a high-level overview of each of the business units and Ernie will follow on with more details on our financial performance. In the compute and networking business unit, we experienced continued revenue growth as a result of strength across all market segments with particular strength in cloud and enterprise. We began enablement of our 1X nanometer products and extended our lead in graphics technology with the announcement of our next generation GDDR5X product which is the fastest discrete memory available. In our mobile business, as in other segments, broad market tightness has resulted in increased ASPs across all types of mobile memory. Our customers continue to be focused on increased memory and storage density for smartphones which nicely plays to Micron strategy to focus on MCP markets. We plan to introduce more than 20 new MCP designs over the next 12 months to address the highest growth mobile applications. Customers prefer these solutions because they simplify design, validation and supply chain processes. MCPs also provide Micron with an opportunity to strengthen our relationship with key market enablers, providing a path to increased market share. Our embedded business grew revenues this quarter through increased DRAM shipments in automotive as well as consumer and connected home applications and we achieved record automotive revenues for the fourth quarter in a row. Increased NAND shipments to industrial multi-market customers helped offset this quarter's anticipated decline in NOR shipments to Japanese gaming applications. Design and activity continues to be strong for our 20 nanometer DDR and LP DDR products in automotive, consumer, connected home and Internet of Things gateway applications. In addition, design-in activity for our latest generation of automotive grade managed NAND continues to increase with new design wins up significantly over the prior quarter. Our storage business performance this quarter was driven by continued shift to cost-effective 3D NAND TLC products and increased traction for our SSD portfolio across the OEM cloud and enterprise markets. Wins with OEM customers enabled a record number of SSD shipments during the quarter. Customer focus on larger capacity and tailored storage solutions led to a dramatic growth in our enterprise and cloud segments which were our fastest-growing part of our SSD portfolio. The trend toward tailored solution drives greater opportunities for Micron to engage end customers on future IT investment planning. As we pursue these opportunities, our flexible, feature-oriented portfolio has been well received by our customers. The storage market has broadly adopted 3D TLC products and we're well-positioned to take advantage of this trend. We're seeing the ongoing demand for high-performance, reliable, power efficient storage driving greater SSD adoption across multiple markets. We anticipate to grow our overall storage bit output as our Fab 10X expansion continues to ramp. Our technology transitions are on track and will continue to provide benefit to the Company over the next several quarters. We're driving deployment of 1X DRAM with meaningful output expected by the end of the fiscal year. We expect 1X nanometer DRAM to build on our success with 20 nanometer DRAM which is deployed throughout our portfolio and rated number one in quality by multiple enterprise OEM customers. Likewise, we're aggressively proliferating 32 layer 3D NAND through our product lines while also driving the deployment of 64 layer 3D NAND with meaningful output expected by the end of the fiscal year. Micron's unique integration of CMOS circuitry under the array will enable the industry's smallest die size on our 64 layer designs. As we look toward the end of our fiscal year, we're currently on track to have more than 75% of our NAND bits on 3D. Of course, certain segments require legacy NAND technologies and will transition much more slowly, embedded markets for example. As we previewed for you at our analyst day, we believe our NAND bit growth in fiscal 2018 will approximate the aggregate market growth. This will take 3D NAND to 90% of our total bit output for fiscal 2018. We continue to work on developing new memory technologies and are enabling our 3D XPoint technology. We will be shipping 3D XPoint memory for revenue later in 2017. We believe these innovative solutions offer unique value to enterprise customers and will be an important contributor to Micron's future success. Now, I'll turn it over to Ernie.
Ernie Maddock: Thank you Mark. The business environments in fiscal Q2 continued to be positive with our results favorably impacted by product mix, progress on our cost improvement and the sustained positive pricing environment. I'll begin my remarks today with an overview of the fiscal Q2 results by technology and business unit followed by our corporate financial performance and guidance for fiscal Q3. DRAM represented 64% of our total revenue with the following segmentation, mobile was in the high 20% range; PC represented 25%; server also represented 25%, up from the high teens of the prior quarter; and specialty DRAM which includes networking, graphics, auto and other embedded technologies, was in the low 20% range. In our nonvolatile memory business, trade NAND represented 30% of our revenue with the following segmentation, consumer which includes memory cards, U.S.B and components, represented approximately 40%; mobile represented 20%; and as a reminder, EMCPs are primarily in the mobile segment. SSDs were in the mid-20% range, up from the mid-teens percent last quarter. And the automotive, industrial multi-market and other embedded applications were in the high teens percent range. Turning to performance by business unit, the compute and networking business units reported fiscal Q2 revenue of $1.92 billion, up 30% sequentially due to firm demand in a robust pricing environment. Non-GAAP operating income was $736 million or 36% of revenue, up from 14% the prior quarter, enhanced by the pricing environment and better performance on costs. We saw good growth in the cloud and enterprise segments driven by shipments of our first generation 20 nanometer DDR4 products. Additionally, we're beginning shipments of our second generation product optimized for the industry's newest service -- server platform. Graphics saw modest revenue growth despite what is traditionally a seasonally weak period and we began shipments of our next generation G5X to Nvidia for the new GeForce 1080Ti, further solidifying Micron's technology leadership in the high-performance graphics memory segment. Networking saw increased shipments and revenue driven by the continued growth  of 20 nanometer 4 gigabit DDR3 and 8 gigabit DDR4 products at key OEMs, especially in Asia and client revenue growth was primarily driven by the continued strong pricing environment. The mobile business unit delivered fiscal Q2 revenue of $1.08 billion, up 5% sequentially, driven by a stronger pricing environment. Non-GAAP operating income was $170 million or 16% of revenue, as pricing strength combined with improved costs. The embedded business unit delivered fiscal Q2 revenue of $590 million, up 2% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating income was $193 million or 33% of revenue. The results were primarily driven by increased automotive unit shipments and increased average selling prices of DDR3 and NAND on a like-for-like basis in our consumer and connected home segments. The storage business delivered fiscal Q2 revenue of $1.04 billion, up 21% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating income was $71 million or 7% of revenue. The results were primarily driven by strong growth in client and cloud SSD shipments and lower costs. Our 5100 cloud drive which was introduced in December, continues to be well received and is in the process of additional calls on a large number of customer platforms. Moving on to overall Company results, revenue for the fiscal second quarter was $4.65 billion, up 17% sequentially and driven primarily by DRAM pricing strength and increased NAND volume shipments in a stable to rising pricing environment. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 38.5%, up from 26% in the prior quarter, driven by product mix, cost reductions and the strong pricing environment. Non-GAAP net income was $1.03 billion or $0.90 per share. Turning to results by product line, DRAM revenue increased 22% compared to the prior quarter as the result of a 1% increase in bit shipments and a 21% increase in ASPs. DRAM gross margins for the second quarter increased 16 percentage points sequentially to 44% driven primarily by the strong pricing environment and cost declines. As we look at the next couple of quarters, we expect that second-half fiscal year 2017 bits out will exceed first-half fiscal year 2017 bits out by about 10%. Our nonvolatile trade revenue, NAND revenue, increased 11% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting an 18% increase in bit shipments. ASPs were down 6% from the prior quarter on a blended basis, primarily as a result of a higher density product mix. Gross margin increased 8 percentage points sequentially to 31% as cost per bit was down 15%. We're seeing like-for-like price increases across nearly all segments and, looking forward, we expect that second-half fiscal year 2017 bits out will exceed first-half fiscal year 2017 bits out by about 30%, occurring primarily in FQ3. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $612 million, at the midpoint of the guidance range. The Company generated operating cash flow of $1.77 billion, representing an increase of $628 million over last quarter. To conform to GAAP reporting relative to the Inotera acquisition, we reflected approximately $350 million of the Inotera purchase price as a reduction to operating cash flows. As a result, our financial statements reflect operating cash flow of $1.41 billion. We ended the quarter with cash, marketable investments and restricted cash of approximately $4.6 billion. In the second fiscal quarter, capital expenditures net of partner contributions were approximately $1.2 billion. Moving now to our guidance for the third quarter, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following, revenue in the range of $5.2 billion to $5.6 billion; gross margin in the range of 44% to 48%; operating expenses between $560 million and $610 million; operating income ranging between $1.8 billion and $2 billion; and EPS ranging between $1.43 and $1.57 per share based on 1.155 billion diluted shares. In closing, we remain focused on achieving the technology transition and cost reduction targets we outlined at our analyst day. Currently, we're tracking to deliver free cash flow in excess of the $1.5 billion we shared with you at that event and continue to view delevering as an important priority. With that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.
Mark Durcan: Thanks Ernie. In summary, we're heading into the third quarter with a strong market environment and steady progress on our technology initiatives. I'm preleased with our execution and we continue to press forward together on technology, operational and product enablement targets. Our continued progress towards these goals will enable us -- will enable further cost reductions and the opportunity to address higher value-added market segments. Looking to the market as a whole, we see increasing customer interest in Micron playing a more collaborative role in solving design challenges and plan to use this environment to strengthen our relationships with industry partners and customers. As you all know, at our analyst conference in February, I announced my retirement. While the board and I work to identify my successor, I remain fully committed and engaged in leading Micron through this exciting and dynamic period. We will provide further updates on our CEO search as appropriate. Operator, we're now ready to begin Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Your question please. 
Harlan Sur: Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the solid quarterly execution and strong outlook. Despite the very optimistic and positive pricing environment, there's been some growing concern around the notion of demand destruction given the strong pricing environment and availability of both DRAM and NAND to a point where I think there is a view forming that there's potential for PC and server destocking on the DRAM side, less DRAM per box, on the mobile side, less DRAM per smartphone and on the NAND side, less uptake of SSDs and more uptake of HDDs. I guess the question is do you see this happening and how does it impact the dynamics of the supply-demand environment going forward?
Mark Durcan: This is Mark. To date, we've seen no indication of that at all really in any segment. It's true that, in cycles, from time to time, that does happen late in a cycle, but, today, we see continued strong bit growth across almost every end market segment and no real indication of that occurring anywhere, in particular not in specialty, not in mobile, certainly not in the enterprise and server area.
Harlan Sur: Great, thank you for that. And then solid results in the NAND business with your margins up I think it's 800 basis points in the quarter. As we think about the cost curve on a go-forward basis and the ramp of your 64 layer 3D, can you just give us an idea on how your yields and performance of the products are doing either relative to your internal targets or relative to the same time last year in the ramp of your 32 layer products?
Mark Durcan: This is Mark. A year ago, Harlan, I can't catch that I even recall where we were on 3D NAND yields, but I will tell you we're very happy with where they are for 32 layer MLC and TLC. And again, TLC is the big piece of that. We're where we thought we ought to be and at very mature yields. 64 layer, as we talked about, is a material piece of our bid output late in the year and we're very happy with the progress we're making there and the yields we're seeing on that technology as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your question please.
Steven Fox: Thanks. Good afternoon. Just two questions from me. First of all, if you could talk a little bit more color around this -- I believe you talked about bit growth of about 30% half-over-half. Maybe qualify or quantify as much as you want to the growth drivers, how much from SSDs versus mobile, etc. And then secondly, can you talk a little bit about the auto growth in the quarter and what's driving that and how that looks into the second half as well and what's the key contributors there? Thank you.
Mark Durcan: Sure. So relative to bit growth with NAND, that was more statement around what our output profile is going to look like. And of course, we will deploy that output to the end markets that we feel will provide the best opportunity for the Company here as we see the back half of the year unfold. Relative to automotive, it's very similar to what we've been consistently talking about -- driver assist systems, infotainment, a lot of what is required as we move up that autonomous driving food chain and as what are today considered to be advanced features in automotive, the automotive business penetrates mid and lower end cars. So that -- there's nothing particularly unique about what continues to drive that. It's the same unfolding story relative to memory deployment in the automotive sector.
Ernie Maddock: I think, if the question is do we participate in all of the various pieces of automotive end demand, the answer is yes. We're in the drivetrain. We're in the ADAS systems. We're in the infotainment systems and continue to maintain strong market share in all those pieces.
Steven Fox: Thanks very much for that. Just real quick on the first comments, on the -- just as it applies to cloud SSDs, your own cloud SSDs that you're launching, can you give a little more color on how broadly we should see those deployed maybe during the fall of this year?
Mark Durcan: Yes. I think you're going to see them very broadly deployed. As we noted, the initial uptakes of that SSD was announced in the early part of December of last year. The uptake has been very strong and we continue to see that growing at a significant rate here as we progress through the calendar year, along with some new features. We have a 5100 SATA drive with PCIE and NVMe coming soon as well, so we think that will help with the proliferation and the expansion of the demand.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri of Cowen. Your question please.
Timothy Arcuri: Thank you very much. I guess, Mark, I'm just looking at the guidance and you guys are guiding to a quarterly earnings number that's like 50% higher than you guys did in the last cycle, yet your stock is still $5.00 below where it peaked last time. And I know there are some changes in the cap structure and whatnot. But I guess the question really is what's the concern you hear from investors when you've been out there on the conference circuit this quarter? Are people worried about the sustainability of the cycle and like what is the big concern from your point of you and is that valid?
Mark Durcan: It's a good question. I think people are looking at the cycle and wondering are we getting long in the tooth, etc.? We start to read stuff about that. We're not seeing that at all. As mentioned, we're not seeing -- really what's driving this cycle when you think about it is broad-based demand across multiple market segments and in particular it's content growth in all of those segments as opposed to particularly strong unit growth in one segment or the other. And so as we look at the market today, it looks very robust from an end market demand and maybe much broader and less unit-driven than we've seen in the past. We also see that the supply, as best we can tell, seems in control relative to demand. And I think, if you think about this cycle versus last cycle, what you saw -- what you saw last cycle was a big chunk of supply come off with the Hynix fire and the reaction with more supply to replace it and so maybe a little less stability than we're seeing this time around. So that's all on the DRAM side. On the NAND side, this HDD replacement cycle is big. We're well into it in client. It's not going to stop in the cloud and enterprise. Mobile storage demand continues to accelerate. And so, again, it's broad-based content growth in all of those end applications and it's supply on the NAND side that's relatively capital-intensive to put in place with complex technology. And so there, again, that all seems like it's in pretty good shape.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay. I guess just to follow onto that, so it looks like, based upon the guidance, that the gross margin in DRAM is going to be in excess of 50%. Usually, that doesn't last very long and people are obviously worried about Samsung adding a bunch of wafers. Why would that not happen this time? Based upon what you know, why would that not happen? And sort of what's your -- obviously, they have to add some wafers. But what's your base assumption for what the competition will do sort of in terms of bit growth this year? Thanks.
Mark Durcan: Again, I think the last cycle was a little different with that instability in supply created by the Hynix fire. I don't know why they would intentionally repeat the mistake from last cycle. They probably are enjoying making good margins. And our view is we just go out and we look at what information is available relative to all the various additions people are making and might be making and what the timeframe that might occur in and then we give you -- you know, what we think that bit growth looks like. And that looks like it's probably actually -- Samsung is actually probably on the low end over the next couple of years relative to what's going on in the industry as a whole. And the industry as a whole is probably a little bit south of where we think demand growth is. So, could it happen? Yes. Why would it happen? I can't forecast that for you.
Ernie Maddock: This is Ernie. I think the important thing to bear in mind is, in the estimates that we've provided for supply growth this year of 15% to 20%, you would have to add some wafers to get into that range. Absent those wafer additions, you would be below the low end of that range, based on everything that we know. So, it is not a surprise that wafers are being added, given the forecast that we believe exists from the supply side.
Mark Durcan: And again, the other thing to keep in mind here is there are some natural impediments. The technology is getting more expensive to deploy. It's getting more difficult. And as we look to the future, we do see trends towards new technologies that might come into place out in time and that may be somewhat of an impediment to people as they think about do I really want to add incremental, significant new wafers to use supply when there may be competing technologies coming.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely of Citi. Your question please.
Chris Danely: I didn't know I went from Jewish to Italian. Anyway, congrats. It feels like we have stepped into a time machine and got off in 1995. Can you just go through your price assumptions for the gross margin guide and then also maybe list the gross margin drivers in order of importance for beyond the May quarter?
Ernie Maddock: This is Ernie. You and I have been around each other long enough to know you're not going to get an answer to your first question. We don't give underlying pricing assumptions to derive our gross margin guidance. Our gross margin guidance stands on its own for what it is. Relative -- can you repeat the second piece, half, of your question please?
Chris Danely: Sure, just list the gross margin drivers in order of importance for wait for beyond the make order?
Ernie Maddock: Yes. So, to do that would be predicting a pricing curve which I also think is troublesome business. As we've talked about, right now, the pricing curve is much flatter than you typically see it and the normal sort of rules of thumb as you look at segments continue to be a little bit inverted as we experience this environment that we're in. So, we have -- we never predict that things go up and to the right for an infinite period of time. You would expect that we would be thinking cautiously as we do our internal business planning which we do. We do apply a very consistent methodology to how we look at things, but we'ren't in a position to tell you when we think that the pricing curve would return to any sort of more normalized perspective that we would have from historical reference.
Chris Danely: That's fine. Since I whiffed on my first question, maybe you'll allow me another follow-up. You talked about delevering now that cash flow is pretty good. Maybe give us any insight into what would be or what would trigger you to start raising capital or restructure the debt? What would be the options out there?
Ernie Maddock: I think we're pretty consistent with what we said at our analyst day. We talked about 50% to 75% of a $1.5 billion number. We're on track for that. We'll do that at a time and a pace of our choosing based upon a wide variety of business circumstances, but we do, as I said in my script, remain committed to this and think that it's an important priority for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Your question please.
Mark Delaney: The first question was a follow-up on just the broader pricing environment. I'm not looking for any absolute number, but just hoping you could help us understand if the contract prices that Micron has seen are still below spot prices. Obviously spot prices rallied pretty significantly, but there's some time maybe before contract can catch up. And just, with what you're guiding at, do you think contract pricing is still below spot in your assumptions?
Ernie Maddock: Certainly, that's the case today. And don't forget we've also talked in the past about how some of our other segments have contracts of longer duration, so you would get the impact of a renewal of those contracts and, generally speaking, that those renewal -- that renewal pricing environment would continue to be favorable as well.
Mark Delaney: That's helpful. And then for a follow-up question, I know the Company talked a bit in the prepared remarks about certain mix shifts that it has been executing on, doing more in areas like SSDs and moving more towards server DRAM and creation. I was hoping you could help us understand how much more you think you can achieve in those areas through the rest of this fiscal year.
Ernie Maddock: Sure. So, on the SSD side of the house, as we mentioned I think in response to an earlier question, we think we're at the early days of what we're seeing in terms of penetration on our cloud and enterprise SSDs. I think we do have fairly good momentum and traction in clients in OEM. So that is how we're looking at or thinking about what the opportunities are on the SSD side of the house. And then you also saw an increase in the percentage of the DRAM output that went into the server and cloud segment and we see those continuing to increase here or the demand side of it continuing to increase here, with all of the new data center deployments and a pretty strong demand environment for those.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra of Baird. Your question please.
Tristan Gerra: You mentioned that you 3D mix would exceed 75% by year-end in NAND. Could you remind me? Are you decommissioning 2D capacity or is that 3D capacity all incremental? And what kind of longer term ratio should we expect between 3D and 2D beyond this year?
Mark Durcan: It's a transition primarily from planar to 3D. If it were 100% transition which it's not, that ratio on a square footage basis might be something north of 2-to-1. But we have incremental space as well, so it's not exactly like that.
Tristan Gerra: Okay. And then could you also remind me, as you transition from 2D to 3D, for the same wafer capacity, what type of bit growth do you get with 64 layer?
Mark Durcan: From a 2D planar NAND, from a planar NAND wafer to a 64 layer 3D NAND wafer?
Tristan Gerra: Correct, yes.
Mark Durcan: It might be -- it's north of 300%, closer to 4X.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer of Summit Redstone. Your question please.
Jagadish Iyer: Thanks for taking my question, two questions. First, in terms of the DRAM bit supply, given that you have had Inotera under your belt, I'm curious why your bit shipments were only in the low single digits. And then I have follow-up.
Ernie Maddock: Inotera has always been part of our output and measured in our bit shipments, so the transaction -- the formal closing of the transaction really did not represent an incremental addition to the Company's bit supply.
Jagadish Iyer: Okay, fair enough. Then on the pricing environment for DRAM, what contributed to the 21% increase? Was there any specific subsegment of DRAM that you saw strength? And do you think that this is a one-time event or how should we think about it? I know you would not give more clarity on pricing going forward, but any color specifically on the 21% increase would be helpful.
Ernie Maddock: We've all been able to read every week about what's happened to DRAM exchange with respect to spot pricing and certainly that trend as influenced every single other segment. So I think, as Mark mentioned in his script, while last quarter the pricing was more focused around what was happening in the client and OEM markets, this quarter, the impact of that having extended over time and consistent with our earlier comments been subject to some of these contract renewals, are starting to manifest themselves across mobile, across enterprise and really the full breadth of the DRAM product portfolio.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your question please.
John Pitzer: Ernie, I know you're not going to talk about kind of forward pricing assumptions in the May guide, but when you look at the May guide and just how significantly above investor expectations it were, I was wondering if you could help us quantify or qualify a little bit to what extent is this being driven by cyclical leverage, like-for-like pricing, versus things that might have a little bit more longevity like your ability to mix into better end markets or your ability to cost-down or just operational efficiencies. And as you answer the question, I'd be curious just to see your view on whether or not you believe you are starting to close that cost cap with some of your peers out there.
Ernie Maddock: I think, one, to reiterate something we said earlier, but it is very important, we're really consistent quarter to quarter with how we think about our guidance. So there was no dramatic change from a methodology point of view in that. And I think, John, you actually hit on many of the points that are contributing to that nice uptick in margin. So, first, we do have a broad profile and that allows us to move between segments and really maximize the opportunity between those segments. And as you saw this quarter, we're tilting more to cloud and enterprise which we think represents some good, long term opportunity for the Company. We have system-level solutions that utilize the breadth of the Company's product portfolio in things like MCPs and builds on the capabilities of the Company with things like SSDs. You have a better technology execution or strong technology execution, in terms of where we have been in the past, so the gap is closing. We've been consistently telling you that we think it will close and we're going to continue to make progress in that regard. And then you do have leverage that comes from the scale that we have achieved over the course of the last two or three years as we've made these technology transitions. So, really, I think, to the point you are making, this is not only about pricing. It's about pricing and everything else that we've been working on collectively as a team to deliver broad operational capability into all of our end markets.
John Pitzer: Then maybe as my follow-up, Mark, in your prepared comments, you talked about having meaningful 1X volume by the end of this fiscal year. I'm wondering if you could quantify what you mean by meaningful. And I guess, from my perspective, it seems like a little bit earlier than I would have expected. Is that true? And if so, are you just finding it an easier ramp? And can you remind us of sort of the cost-downs you expect to get with the move to 1X?
Mark Durcan: I don't want to put too much specificity around exactly where we will end up at the end of the year on a bit mix, but I will tell you that you will recall, at the analyst day, we shared with you that we believe we were making very good progress on our 1X nanometer yield ramp at that time and that continues to go really very smoothly with a good progress in both Taiwan and Japan. So, we're very happy with the way it's going and we will continue to monitor that and drive it appropriately. I will say also that there's a pretty good suite of products that penetrate a number of different end market segments and those qualifications are going well and those products are looking very robust. And I'm happy with the way that's coming along. From a cost perspective, I think greater than 20% is what we've indicated in the past and that's probably a good place to leave it for now. At the end of the day, it will depend on mix. We've got a lot of different products going in a lot of different segments.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your question please.
Joe Moore: I'm wondering if you could touch on the NAND prices being down sequentially. I was little surprised to see that relative to what we're hearing.
Mark Durcan: It's primarily around mix. We're shipping a lot of high density TLC 3D product versus, previously, we had some lower density products hanging out in some pretty small niches as our volume has gone up and as we've begun to drive more towards some of these higher density cloud type applications. We're doing more those types of products and all of the pricing is down. They are driving some pretty significant cost improvements for us as well. And so, from a margin perspective, that's definitely where we want to be moving through time here.
Joe Moore: Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you. And then your inventory picked up a little bit and I was surprised to see that because I know how much customers want product. Can you just talk about, that and did that sort of -- is that the ramp in NAND or what are we seeing there?
Ernie Maddock: Consistent with sort of the ambitious plans we have around the SSD market, I would say the majority of that was attributable to that build-up. And in addition to that, if you are doing a quarter-on quarter compare, Inotera on the DRAM side was not considered part of the inventory in the December quarter -- or sorry, in the prior quarter -- whereas it's currently part of our inventory. So that was really a significant part of the increase on the DRAM side. So, it's those two things.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah of Nomura. Your question please.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Kristen Shak [ph] in for Romit Shah. Thanks for letting me ask a question and congrats on the great quarter, guys. My first question, you gave some helpful commentary about the bit growth for the second half of fiscal 2017 versus the first half of fiscal 2017. I was just wondering if you could give some color about how we should think about the cost declines for the second half versus the first half. I'm not looking for anything, really concrete numbers, just anything qualitative would be great.
Ernie Maddock: I think the best way I would guide you do there is we have actually provided what we thought was going to be a fiscal year -- a fiscal year cost-down target for both technologies and we've now given you all of the pieces that you need to compute that. So, that's how I would guide you to come up with your estimate of what you think our cost-downs are going to be.
Unidentified Analyst: And then we're still seeing a lot of the spec-ing uptrends for Chinese smartphones, especially in DRAM. With the strong pricing that we've seen in DRAM over the past few months, do you see that trend changing or do you see that trend continuing? Any color there would be great.
Mark Durcan: Sorry, the question around Chinese phones was content or --
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, content, mainly in DRAM content.
Mark Durcan: We continue to see, in the lower-end and midtier phones, we continue to see pretty good content growth. Yes, there is more of a concern at the high end in terms of what eventually will people stop taking densities up there, but even at the high end, I think we anticipate some continued growth with 6 to 8 gigabits at the top. But in the lower-tier and mid-tier smartphones, we still see pretty robust growth and so, in aggregate, when we look at mobile, we're thinking in terms of 30% bit growth there this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini of Susquehanna. Your question please.
David Ryzhik: This is David Ryzhik for Mehdi. Just two if I can. Just how can we think about contract discussions with customers? Are you seeing more long term type of duration negotiations? And I just had a quick follow-up. Thanks.
Mark Durcan: It's very different segment to segment, customer to customer. So, I wouldn't say that there is a huge sea change, although clearly there are some customers in this kind of environment that are interested in lengthier relationships.
David Ryzhik: Great. And for 3D NAND, any update on timing of QLC introduction and would you introduce it at the 64 layer density? Thanks.
Mark Durcan: Yes, we're not going to be too specific yet about our QLC plans, but we will confirm that we're happy with the way that technology is progressing. And that's probably all we've got to say for now.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Mertens of Needham & Company. Your question please.
Robert Mertens: Just two quick questions on behalf of Raji Gill. You spoke a little bit towards the yields with 3D NAND on the 32 layer. Could you just talk a little bit about your competitive advantage going forward on the 3D NAND side and then also just give a little bit more color on your gross margin trajectory and how we should think about that throughout the year? Thank you.
Mark Durcan: We're not going to give you gross margins, as Ernie already indicated unfortunately. We're just not going to go there. But relative to our competitive position on 3D NAND, we feel very good about it. I would direct you back to the comments we made in the slides we showed at the analyst conference a couple of months ago. We're very happy with our 32 layer yields. We're very happy with how we're progressing on our 64 layer spec. And we think we're in the lead position relative to our cost effectiveness and our density and our ability to deliver products at all the [indiscernible].
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Evercore. Your question please.
C.J. Muse: Can you guys -- first question -- update us on your thoughts in terms of DRAM supply demand for this year? And are we to assume that tightening shortages should continue through the calendar year? And then assuming the wafers that you already have baked into that 15% to 20% supply, if we don't see new wafers next year and we just think about a world that shrinks, how should we think about supply into calendar 2018?
Mark Durcan: We really don't have an update for you. It's still, in our view, it's 15% to 20% supply growth this year, could actually be less than that if there's less new wafers than we have in our plan. Demand is still 20% plus. Next year, we would be in the teens if we don't get the new wafers.
C.J. Muse: Great. And as a follow-up, you talked about second-half DRAM bits being 10% higher than first-half. I'm assuming that's production. Can you hit that on a sales basis or should we assume slightly less, given the timing of 1X?
Ernie Maddock: No, that was representative of what we think will ultimately be reflected in our financial statements.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin of UBS. Your question please.
Stephen Chin: I had a question on, first of all, for the NAND flash business with mobile being only 20% of the sales there. I was wondering. Just given the relatively low exposure there currently relative to the overall market, is that implying that, for the second half of the year, you are expecting you'll see a lot of seasonality that's helping to drive some of the second-half 30% half-on-half growth?
Ernie Maddock: Again, the 30% was a function of our output and we would direct that output into the various outlets that we have, whether it be the SSD business, the mobile business, etc. So, we will sort of wait and see how that plays out here as we get to the back half of the year.
Stephen Chin: Okay, that's fair. As my follow-up, in terms of the gross margin guidance, can you talk a bit about the implied cost reductions on both DRAM and NAND flash for this quarter's guidance? Just given the relatively high output for your 20 nanometer DRAM and also I guess the ramping nature of 32 layer 3D, is there still a lot of cost reduction in the current quarter from both of those technologies?
Ernie Maddock: Again, I'd kind of refer you back to the full-year guidance that we provided which was rather specific. We have now completed two quarters of that year and we've given you a view of the back-half bit growth. So I think we've given you all the building blocks that you need to derive a gross margin profile and that's not something that we typically share. And operator, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: We have a question from Mark Newman of Bernstein. Your line is open.
Mark Newman: I have a question around your supply growth, given there is such strong pricing out there in the market. So, firstly, can you talk about what the underlying wafer capacity trend is doing for Micron in both DRAM and NAND this year? And related to that, how much flexibility, given how strong pricing is today, how much flexibility does Micron have to add more either this calendar year or next year? I'm not saying that you will. Just how much flexibility do you have to add more if, for whatever economic means reasons, you could make the calculation that it does make sense to add more? Thanks.
Mark Durcan: I think the best way -- as best as we going to characterize wafers would be to say it's pretty stable. We're very focused on technology transitions. We're not focused on adding more supply, so we're just utilizing the existing capacity and transitioning it through advanced nodes. We do have white space in both our Fab 16 in Taichung as well as Fab 10X, but we're not planning any capacity additions this year. And if we were to decide we wanted to which I think is unlikely, for us, as for our competitors, there is significant leadtime at the moment for equipment and it would take quite a while to bring that on in the marketplace.
Mark Newman: Is it possible to quantify how much it would be in terms of wafers? Again, not saying you're going to add it, but just how much capacity you have the ability -- and how much do you have the ability to add in both DRAM and NAND?
Mark Durcan: No and, again, it's kind of moot. So, thanks for the questions.
Ernie Maddock: This is Ernie. Before we close, I wanted to share with everyone that Ivan is going to be transitioning out of his IR role into another role here at Micron and I wanted to personally express my appreciation to him for his support of the Company during his tenure in IR, including bringing me up to speed which was quite challenging, I'm sure. We will miss him very, very much. We're in the process of determining how best to fill his shoes, but in the interim, Liz Morali will be the primary IR contact point. And with that, we will say thanks again for your participation and we'll talk to you next quarter.
Mark Durcan: Thank you everyone.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's Micron Technology second quarter 2017 financial release conference call. You may now disconnect.

Mark Durcan: Thank you, Ivan. For fiscal Q1 2017, Micron posted total revenue of $3.97 billion with non-GAAP gross margin of 26% and net income of $335 million or $0.32 per share. Revenue, gross margin, operating income all exceeded our guidance. Operating cash flow was $1.1 billion. In the first quarter, we saw an acceleration of the positive market conditions to begin this fall.  For the industry, supply is slowing demand is stronger on a number of key segments and inventory is at low levels. Prices have been strengthening on a like-for-like basis across all leading SDRAM and NAND products and we see this trend continuing into the current quarter.  To give you some perspective on pricing dynamics. After declining for roughly 18 months, PC DRAM ASPs are up 50% to 60% compared to the trough pricing driven by an improvement in demand, with slightly low inventory levels and the impact of supply shifts to other segments. In contrast to all other DRAM segments declined substantially less over the same period and are recovering at a slower rate.  Given the duration of a broad supply and demand tightness in the market, we are currently seeing improvements in quarter-over-quarter pricing trends in these non-PC segments. Taking all these variables together, blended DRAM ASPs are essentially flat compared to the same period last year.  With this in mind and as we look at our current quarter, operational execution is driving DRAM sales up more than $1 billion year-over-year, while our cost-of-good-sold is up only about half this amount, driving substantial improvements in gross margins.  Product mix has a more significant impact on the NAND landscape where we are also experiencing like-for-like pricing increases. However, we are also shifting our product portfolio to 3D and TLC NAND, which enables higher density and lower cost products that also have lower ASPs. Taking together, blended NAND ASPs are down approximately 10% year-over-year, while gross margins are up meaningfully. Turning to the industry outlook, we are currently -- we currently expect 2017 DRAM Disk supply growth in the 15% to 20% range. This is based on an assumption that suppliers’ won’t add significant wafer for capacity to the industry, but will continue to focus on process node migrations to enable cost reductions and natural supply growth.  This compares to our long-term bit demand growth forecast of approximately 20% to 25%. We expect favorable supply and demand dynamics to persist in 2017. For NAND, we estimate 2017 industry bit growth in the high 30% to low 40% range, which is in line with 2016.  This compares to our long-term bit demand growth forecast of approximately 40% to 45%. 3D conversions continue to be a headwind to industry supply growth. This factor along with strong demand for storage and mobile solutions sets up for a well-balanced supply and demand dynamic in 2017. I’ll now provide a high level overview of each of our business units and Ernie will follow with more details on the specific financial performances. In the Compute and Networking business unit, we experience revenue growth as a result of strengthening or strengthened demand.  We executed well to our 20 nanometer shipment plan and achieved key qualifications of 64 gigabyte LRDIMMs at multiple server customers. We also continued our strong performance in the graphic segment, where our GDDR5X Technology leads competitors. In our mobile business unit, the completion of our customer qualifications drove substantial revenue and profit growth this quarter. As noted last quarter, we continue to see the Chinese market driving mobile growth and higher memory content for smartphone.  We have strong growth in our LPDRAM and mobile NAND product lines and are focused on new qualification opportunities as we see the mobile market as one of the strongest growth drivers of our business. Our Embedded business was driven by strong demand across a variety of segments. Our NAND based MCPs continue to win business in machine-to-machine communications modules and our strong portfolio also brought us significant share in several new home automation and action camera platforms this quarter. We expect our new application optimize SD cards to drive market share gains within both industrial and connected home segments.  Our automotive business had another excellent quarter. We are securing an increasing number of automotives design wins on our leading edge, managed NAND and 20 nanometer DRAM products. We also see automotive demand for advanced memory technology is accelerating as more sophisticated ADAS systems come to market in the years ahead. Our storage business unit continued to make progress shifting our portfolio to advanced 3D NAND technologies. First, the 1,100 client SSDs we announced last quarter completed qualifications and we commenced volume shipments with several major customers. This compliments our crucial MX 300 consumer drive, which is currently shipping at high volumes.  Additionally we announced our cloud based 5100 SATA ESSD earlier this month offering industry leading performance in 8 terabyte capacities. All three of these SSDs are built with our TLC 3D NAND and illustrate our focus portfolio transition to this high capacity, high performance and cost effective technology. We continue to provide updates with respect to critical targets related to operational execution originally shared at our Analyst Day in August 2015. Thus far these milestones including bit crossover in 20 nanometer DRAM and 3D NAND and the SSD product release roadmap have all been achieved on or ahead of schedule.  Our two year bit growth and cost per bit targets remain on track and we continue to be focused on delivering to our commitments. Our focus in DRAM this year is primarily related to the deployment of our 1X nanometer technology. We're targeting meaningful output on 1X by the latter part of fiscal 2017. We expect to generate approximately 20% to 25% cost per bit reductions in fiscal 2017. Our cash cost for bit declines will be well above this range. For NAND we will continue to focus on ramping our Gen One 3D as well as TLC. We've also commenced production on our second generation 64 layer 3D technology and we're targeting meaningful output by the latter part of fiscal 2017. The 3D and TLC ramps will deliver 22% to 25% cost per bit improvement in fiscal 2017. This cost per bit includes the impact of expanding our SSD, EMCP and managed NAND solutions which carry additional building materials and cost, but will also enable a richer ASP mix.  Relative to 3D XPoint technology we will be shipping our QuantX solutions for revenue in 2017 and continue to believe this innovative technology will be an important contributor to Micron's future success.  This month just after our quarter closed, we finalized the acquisition of Inotera in Taiwan, which we expect to continue to provide strategic and financial opportunities for the company. We are excited to welcome the Inotera team to Micron and look forward to realizing the benefits of the new operating model. Now I'd like to turn it over to Ernie. 
Ernie Maddock: Thank you, Mark. As we indicated earlier this month, we continue to see positive trends in the overall business environment resulting in fiscal Q1 performance that came in above the high end of the guidance ranges we provided in October.  Today, I'll first discuss some technology and business unit details followed by an overview of the company's result for the quarter and guidance for our fiscal second quarter. DRAM represented 61% of our total revenue with the following segmentation. Mobile represented about 30%, up from 25% to prior quarter.  The PC segment was in the mid-20% range and the server business was in the high-teens percent range. Specialty DRAM, which includes networking, graphics, auto and other embedded technologies was in the mid-20% range down from the prior quarter. In our non-volatile memory business, trade revenue represented 32% of total revenue with the following segmentation. Consumer which includes memory cards, USB and components represented 40% down from the prior quarter. Mobile was in the low-20% range up from the prior quarter as we saw the continued impact of our completed customer qualifications.  As a reminder, AMCPs are primarily in the mobile segment. SSDs were in the mid-teens range up from the prior quarter and the automotive industrial multi-market and other embedded applications were in the 20% range. Turning to performance by business unit, the compute and networking business unit reporting fiscal Q1 revenue of $1.47 billion, up 18% sequentially, primarily due to stronger demand and higher 20 nanometer shipments and a stronger pricing environment. The non-GAAP operating profit was $204 million or 14% of revenue.  In the enterprise segment, we executed well in shipping 20 nanometer solutions to the market and qualified several lower cost products at multiple customers. Cloud was CNB's fastest growing segment and Micron is now qualified on most high volume sockets for the top customers in this segment. Demand is being driven by both our leading edge DDR4 solutions, as well as continuing need for DDR3.  In graphics, we had continued share growth in GDDR with our major graphics customers. New graphics card launches and strong console sales sustain favorable demand for both GDDR5 and GDDR5-X. In networking, we saw shipment and revenue growth bolstered by the continue transaction to 20 nanometer, 4 gigabyte DDR3 and 8 gigabyte DDR4. We continue to see strong interest in our high performance memory portfolio as well. Finally within the client segment, ASP strength exceeded our expectations and solid execution on 20 nanometer drove improved shipments and cost reductions. The mobile business delivered fiscal Q1 revenue of $1.03 billion, up 54% sequentially driven by completed customer qualifications and strong sales and LPDRAM and mobile NAND products in an improved pricing environment.  The non-GAAP operating income was $89 million or 9% of revenue as we continue to ramp our 20 nanometer products and made substantial progress reducing higher cost early production inventory. The embedded business unit delivered fiscal Q1 revenue of $578 million, up 13% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating income was $178 million or 31% of revenue. The results were primarily driven by seasonally strong consumer business and record automotive revenue. Embedded ASP trends tend to be more stable compared to the broader compute and mobile market, but we are beginning to see the benefit of tightening supply demand in this business unit as well.  Consumer revenue was up 25% sequentially, driven by home automation and camera application. In addition our 20 nanometer DDR4 product continue to ramp into some 4-K set-top box applications. The automotive business performed well with revenue up 7% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. These solid results continue to be driven by strong and increasing demand for both DDR3 and e-MMC solutions for infotainment, instrument cluster and LPDRAM for advanced driver assistance systems applications. The industrial and multi market business increase 6% sequentially with a strong quarter for our NOR business combined with ramping our NAND solutions into the Japanese amusement market. In addition, we continue to see growing demand for our industrial grade managed NAND solutions. The storage business delivered fiscal Q1 revenue of $860 million, up 13% sequentially. The non-GAAP operating loss was $45 million or 5% of revenue. During the quarter SBU strengthened both the NAND and SSD product portfolio having now entered fully ramped production and customer qualification of 3D TLC NAND clients and cloud drives.  Our ramp of 3D TLC cost competitive products will positions us to effectively participate more fully in this growth segment. SBU is also benefiting from a favorable supply demand balance in the industry with like-for-like pricing improving for many products. Demand drivers look strong for the foreseeable future. Moving on to overall company results, revenue for the first fiscal quarter was $3.97 billion, up 23% sequentially and driven by strong volume shipments for DRAM combined with increasing ASPs. Trade NAND shipments also increased as a result of the successful crossover of 3D production, which occurred in the quarter and we experienced stable blended ASPs with like-for-like ASPs trending up in many cases. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 26%, up from 19% in the prior quarter, driven by a strong pricing environment particularly for DRAM and solid execution on cost per bit reductions. NAND cost reductions were driven by an ongoing ramp of 3D and the portfolio shifting to higher density TLC enabled solutions. Non-GAAP net income was $335 million or $0.32 per share. Turning to results by product line, DRAM revenue increased 24% compared to the prior quarter, as a result of an 18% increase in bit shipments and a 5% increase in ASPs. DRAM gross margins for the first quarter increased 8 percentage points sequentially to 28%, primarily driven by the strong pricing environment and continued 20 nanometer RAM. Our non-volatile trade revenue increased 26% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting a 26% increase in bit shipments.  ASPs were relatively unchanged from the prior quarter on a blended basis. Gross margin increased 6 percentage points sequentially to 23% as cost per bit was down 8% benefiting from the 3D and TLC ramps. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $594 million slightly below the lower end of our guided range, driven by lower prequalification expenses, lower legal costs and higher expense sharing credits. The company generated cash flow of $1.1 billion an increase of $200 million over last quarter and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable investments of approximately $4.3 billion. In the first fiscal quarter, capital expenditures net of partner contributions were approximately $1.18 billion. Moving now to the guidance for the second quarter, on a non-GAAP basis we expect the following. Consolidated revenue in the range of $4.35 billion to $4.7 billion, gross margin in the range of 31% to 34%, operating expenses between $590 million and $640 million, operating income ranging between $800 million and $900 million, and EPS ranging between $0.58 and $0.68 per share based on 1,123,million diluted shares. Please note that as indicated earlier this month, we expect the impact from the Inotera acquisition to be accretive beginning this quarter. Specifically for fiscal quarter two we expect the accretion to positively impact gross margins by low single-digit percentage and contribute approximate $0.02 to EPS. These impacts have already been included in the guidance I just provided and will not be further distinguished as we provide guidance in future quarters. From an operational perspective we remain on track to achieve the bit growth and cost per bit reduction targets that was previously shared and we look forward to sharing more details on our progress and plans at our analyst conference on February 2nd.  With that, I will turn it back to Mark. 
Mark Durcan: Thank you, Ernie. To summarize, we're entering our second quarter with a number of positive drivers across the business. The markets for both DRAM and NAND are healthy and improving and I'm pleased with our operational execution over the past several quarters. We will continue deploying leading edge technology and shifting our product portfolio toward higher value segments and products. Operator, we're now ready to begin the Q&A. 
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Your line is open. 
Chris Hemmelgarn: Hey this is Chris Hemmelgarn on for Blayne, thanks very much for taking the question and congrats on the great quarter. I guess first of all just regarding Inotera, could you help us understand kind of roughly how much you expect consolidating it fully consolidating operations to add to bit output on the DRAM side in the February quarter?
Ernie Maddock: We already had included the benefits of that since we took the 100% of the output. So it really represents no material change to anything we’ve provided previously. 
Chris Hemmelgarn: No, I just mean in terms of obviously you'd expect the recognized bit output to be up quarter-on-quarter. Any guide in terms of what percentage of the existing?
Mark Durcan: No. Obviously we said all along that as we have full managerial control of the entity, we will have increased operational flexibility and the opportunity to potentially fine tune some of our management practices et cetera. We expect that overtime that will provide some modest benefits to manufacturing efficiency. All of those are baked into our overall projections on a go forward basis. And we don't anticipate breaking out individual FABs for you on a go forward basis. 
Chris Hemmelgarn: Okay, that's helpful. And then as quick follow up. It's been obviously a lot in the news about potential changes to policies with the new presidential administration coming in, as I recall that you guys had a chance to kind a sit-down and chat some of that over with them. I was just curious if you had any thoughts about how some of the rule [ph] changes are going to impact your business in the coming years. 
Mark Durcan: Micron did not actually participate in the gathering of tech executives that happened recently. Through our activities, our ongoing activities and engagement with government we continue to stay involved in all sorts of policies that we believe impact our business. But there is really nothing specific that we would have to say about how that transition is going or anything of that nature at this point.
Chris Hemmelgarn: Okay, thanks so much and congrats again on the strong quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho. Your line is open. 
Vijay Rakesh: Hi, guys congratulation on a great set of results here. Just on the DRAM side, I know you mentioned that’s obviously great results there as well, how is the 60 nanometer going, how do you see the transition to 60 nanometer actually progressed through the year?
Mark Durcan: I am sorry, to 1x nanometer.
Vijay Rakesh: Yeah.
Mark Durcan: On the DRAM front, we are very pleased with the product progress we are making, we have a number -- broad set of products that are supported by that 1x technology, its running in Japan as well as our DRAM FAB in Taichung and we have a number of mobile products as well as compute and server products all of which are progressing on schedule and we are quite happy with. 
Vijay Rakesh: Great. And on the 3D NAND side, happy to see you guys startup the second generation 64 layer. Any thoughts on how we should see that progress, obviously on cross over already, but how do you see the 64 layer ramping throughout 2017? Thanks. 
Mark Durcan: Yeah, just to reiterate. We believe it will be significant late in the fiscal year in terms of the bit output, it’s a very significant shrink for us. So we are very excited about the efficiencies that it will bring to our operation, but its impact will occur later in the fiscal year.
Vijay Rakesh: Great, thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Your question please. 
Mark Delaney: Yes, good afternoon and thanks very much for taking the questions. First question I was hoping you could help us understand the sustainability of some of the strong bit growth trends that you reported in the November quarter, I think you talked about growing above the market in 2017 in both DRAM and NAND, can you sustain some of these types of strong sequential bit growth trends as you look into February?
Ernie Maddock: Yeah, we don’t have any bit growth update for you relative to the two year CAGR that we previously forecast, we are still on track to sustain those numbers and trying to get down to quarter-to-quarter we think is less productive than continue to focus on that long-term productivity increasing trend.
Mark Delaney: Got it, okay. And then for a follow-up questions I was hoping you could help us understand a little bit more of some of the end market trends in PCs and handsets and if you could elaborate specifically on what you are seeing in terms of demand trend in the China handset market?
Ernie Maddock: Yeah, so first of all on PCs, I think you have got the same market data we have there, but the PC industry ended up maybe a little stronger than any of us anticipated, still from a unit perspective flattish to maybe down a percent, but overall generating about 10% DRAM bit growth going into that segment.  Mobile is interesting, we continue to see pretty good bit growth by system, on average for the mobile market probably move into 2.4 gigabyte of DRAM and high 30s somewhere in the 35% to 40% maybe in the middle of that range in terms of gigabytes of NAND. So that would then -- if you net that out that’s almost 20% DRAM bit growth for system and maybe little north of 40% on NAND. So for that market in aggregate pretty strong and in particular the value smartphone probably seeing the highest bit growth per system of any of those segments.
Ernie Maddock: Thank you very much. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rajvindra Gill of Needham and Company. Your line is open. 
Rajvindra Gill: Yes, thank you. Congratulations as well on excellent results. Housekeeping question first on the taxes, I think this quarter it was above $30 million, can you give some sense of what the guidance for taxes going forward will be?
Ernie Maddock: I think I’ve guided to low-teens millions which would be kind of low single-digit tax rate and that will change as the company’s profitability changes obviously when the profitability goes up the tax rate will sequentially decline a little bit because of where that income is generated and show the company's profitability decline the actually rate will creep up just a little bit.
Rajvindra Gill: Okay, great. And in the commentary you had mentioned around 15% to 20% bit supply growth in DRAM barring any additional supply from competitors. Can you talk a little bit about the -- what you're seeing in terms of the transition to 80 nanometer for some of your competitors? And is there risk in your mind in terms of additional supply coming online, any thoughts on that would be helpful.
Mark Durcan: We don't have great crystal ball as to where our competitors are doing. We read the same reports that you guys read. All of that plus all the other internal intelligence we can generate that baked into our ranges and in the data sheet that we provided. So I think there has been some chatter recently potentially about few incremental wafers from one of the suppliers.  Our view of that is if that were to happen, it's a relatively minor adjustment in terms of the overall scope of the bit growth that we're projecting and it would probably not cause us to change that range that we’ve giving you.
Rajvindra Gill: Alright great. And last question in terms of -- on the balance sheet, how do you think about kind of reducing the level of debt going forward now that you're entering into period of higher free cash flow generation we’re at about $8.5 billion or close to $10 billion of debt. Any thoughts on the strategy about the reducing debt levels overtime?
Ernie Maddock: Yes, so to be consistent with my prior comments. First thing I want to do is make sure we generate the cash, which we're working on previously and expect to make some headway on here with the results we've just shared.  And then as we get to that point and look at the credit markets, as well as a number of other factors, we will make a determination about the best way to delever, but delevering for the company remains an important priority as we have an expectation of increased free cash flow this year.
Rajvindra Gill: Okay, great. Thanks again. 
Operator: Thanks. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri of Cowen. Your question please. 
Timothy Arcuri: Thank you very much. First question I guess Mark you've made some recent comments about China and about them potentially splitting the market if they do get access to IT. So my question is can you again remind us of sort of what your mission statement is around the potential of sharing IT or licensing IT into China. Thanks.
Mark Durcan: Yeah, so first of all let me say that comments that I make in the press are sometimes not in the full context of the discussion I had. And I think one of the things to think about in terms of what might or might not happen in China is that these things do take time. Our investment cycles take place over a periods of useful life of equipment of five years.  So we think in the long term when we think about investing in our business to make sure that we're being good stewards of the shareholders' money. But anything that would happen there is going to play out over many years. And having a crystal ball as to exactly how that will play out is difficult to say. Relative to what Micron has said about our interests in China, we have a great interest in doing business in China. We have large existing operations there including backend operations, circuit design, product engineering activities as well as software and firmware activities.  So we have a lot of activity in China already from an operations perspective. And we have a large number of important customers over there. So we stay fully engaged with China and continue to expect to have strong relationships there and grow our business. Relative to whether we would undertake any expansion or licensing activity in China. What we said is really as it has been which is our job is to look for opportunities to make Micron a stronger company. And we will continue to investigate lots of options about ways to generate shareholder value whether it's in China or in any part of the world.  And that’s just part of us being effective managers of the company. And we'll continue to do that and if we can figure out things that make the stronger we'll always consider that in terms of the long-term benefits and act accordingly.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay, great. Thank you for that. And then I guess I had a follow-up for the question that was asked about some of the tax law changes coming. It seems pretty obvious that there is going to be some sort of that that gets added to product that’s made outside the U.S. and you guys are obviously fairly exposed to that.  So I am wondering, is there any like contingency planning happening and I am sort of trying to assess the likelihood that maybe CapEx might have to be a little higher as you may have to plan for some of those contingencies? Thanks.
Ernie Maddock: So Tim, I mean really it’s an issue of what you think any such tariffs or what not. How they would impact our end market not necessarily as they directly impact Micron because typically we manufacture overseas, we sell in many cases overseas and then it’s our customers who would then be subject to any of those importation issues.  So I think it’s really too soon to tell what the impact of that would be because simultaneously we’re reading about a dramatic reduction of the corporate tax rate and also the ability to repatriate billions of dollars of cash. So there is a lot of moving pieces to this and I think anybody who would pertain to be able to specifically predict things is probably guessing a little bit right now.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay Ernie, thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. 
Joe Moore: Great, thank you. I wonder if you can just give us some context on why the markets are so good. And I guess in particular you know when I look at your shipments have been stronger than I expected. Your competitor shipments have been a bit stronger than I expected and yet are mean our checks and everyone check show this good now and staying good for a while.  Can you give us any context on why the supply demand balance has shifted so much in a favorable direction when everyone is kind of shipping more bits than the sort of long-term trend line?
Mark Durcan: Yes at the end of the day Joe it’s got to be adding up all the pieces right and having less supply than demand. I will say that as the end markets that we ship into continue to segregate and the product has to find its way into the right or the wafer have to find their way into the right product at the right time for the right segment.  Getting that balance exactly right segment-to-segment becomes difficult. And therefore I think it provides the opportunity for supply -- for pricing to react to changes in supply and demand in a way that’s I think is positive from a manufacturers’ perspective.
Joe Moore: Great, that’s helpful. Thank you. And then secondly in terms of your NAND planning is there going to continue to be a long tail on the planer NAND business or do you see the whole business kind of transitioning to 3D overtime?
Mark Durcan: There is definitely a tail and it definitely exists for a long time. The question is how significant is that in terms of bits and what eventually will be the pricing in that long tail. I think that the planer bits are going to get squeezed out of a lot of the end market applications as we start to generate more 3D supply as an industry.  However, there will be a long tail it’s probably less than 10% of the overall market that sticks around for a long, long time and serves as very valuable niches. So it’s a matter of getting that balance right and making sure that you have the product -- have the right products in that in those lagging nodes so you can address the right market opportunities. 
Joe Moore: That’s very helpful. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your question please. 
Steven Fox: Hi, good afternoon. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the higher margin higher mix products where maybe where you mentioned like-for-like pricing also getting better for example in the storage business unit with SSDs.  How are you managing your customer expectations for a longer design cycles and qualification cycles given that product is tight now and you are saying it could be tight for a while especially as you ramp 3D NAND and maybe it has some puts and takes along the way?
Mark Durcan: Yes, it’s always tricky when you have customers with supply expectations making sure that you are making the right commitments that you can deliver on while not significantly over under committing. And there are lots of those segments that are sort of value add where you have to have long-term customer relationships where there is a certain amount of trust and I think from Micron’s perspective that’s actually an advantage for us.  Our customers like us, they want us to succeed, we have a long-term history of meeting our commitments. And so I think in this kind of environment that actually plays out pretty well for us. Some of the specific segments that are value add that are pretty important thing like graphics, we grew our graphics business pretty substantially this year. In many cases those are sole source relationships or two sources at most and a significant piece of the customers end products. And so those types or relationships I think are flagships for that kind of thought process.  Automobile also I think is another one where Micron has very significant market share deep relationships with the customers and a trust that we are going to be there for them with the right products as markets tighten up.
Steven Fox: That’s really helpful. And then just quick clarification, so on Inotera understand you don’t want to go too much deeper into the number, but in terms of some of the synergies that are potentially ahead of you with Inotera should we just think a bit more as the flexibility to manage bits a little bit more efficiently or is there should we consider that there could be some meaningful cost savings that could come through for the margin down the road? Thanks.
Ernie Maddock: This is Ernie. I think the best way to think about is what Mark articulated earlier which is the cost synergies are relatively small the real opportunity will be as we align the manufacturing capability fully to the best of Micron fabs and that will provide more incremental opportunity to us and the cost savings piece.
Steven Fox: Great, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Chris Danely of Citi Group. Your line is open.
Chris Danely: Thanks guys. Quick question on mobile end market, you talked about China is being a big driver there, can you give us any sense of how big China is as far as your mobile demand or how big of the increase it was sequentially?
Mark Durcan: We have pretty good growth obviously in all geographies and with a lot of I think customers with the mobile business doubling. Some of that was with was with the market leaders but a lot of it was also was in China. So, e-MCP have been a great business for us, lot of that is in the Chinese value handsets and I don’t think we want to get specific in terms of percentages but I think it’s fair to say that we had strong growth in China as well as some of the high end smartphone manufacturers.
Chris Danely: Great. And then second question on another end market PCs, so again we all read the same stuff you do about shortages in DRAM in the PC end market, would you say that that is the end market where supply is tightest and any estimate of when these lead times could be or these extending lead times could be relieved?
Mark Durcan: Yeah, I would say it’s tight there but product is moving around. Right, the industry is not static and what tends to happen as the market tightens up like this is people will sacrifice a little bit short term margin to move into segments that they believe are longer-term more advantaged. And so there is a little bit of that going on right now where perhaps margins might actually be a little higher in PCs, but people may shift production into servers because it’s viewed as potentially longer term more favorable or noble because its maybe slightly more defendable market share as things change over time.
Chris Danely: Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Pitzer: Good afternoon guys, thanks for letting me ask the question. Mark, I guess my first question is just around sort of your DRAM profitably versus peers, I mean absolutely clearly DRAM is getting better, but there is still there is gap between the peers, I’m wondering if you can talk about the 1x transaction for you, it seems like there is two vectors where you might be able to close that gap.  One, it just seems like a better shrink for you than maybe your peers and; two, correct me if I am wrong, but most of Rexchip I believe is still a 25 nanometers. So it might seem to me that as you guys move to 1x you will have a big bigger wafer start base at 1x than you had at 20 nanometers, am I thinking about that the right way or how are you thinking about it?
Mark Durcan: First of at a level we're going to continue to outgrow the market in terms of bits like we talked about. And we're reducing cost at a faster rate than we have over the last three years. So that gap will continue to narrow with the forecast we've given you. Specifically relative to 110 series, yes it's a good shrink we have as I mentioned we've got a number of different products coming some of them are bigger shrink than others.  And we’re particularly excited about some of the ones that come later in the fiscal year that really drive out at a lot of costs in die size as appose to some of the ones that come earlier and fill value added potential segments or specific power or performance attributes that the customers are looking for. Beyond that I think it's fair to say that we should get good bank for the buck on this technology transition not only because it's a substantial shrink, but also because a chunk of it the large chunk of it’s happening in Taichung so we're actually transitioning capacity from 25 nanometer all the way down to 1x. So it's as we did with 20 nanometer in Hiroshima and in Inotera and a big chunk of that capacity at Inotera was doubled half from 30 nanometer to 20 nanometer. This will be a double half from 25 to 1x at the Taichung fab. And so there is a pretty good bank for the buck there. 
John Pitzer: That's helpful. And guys as my follow up you're still endorsing the two year CAGR for bit growth in NAND and DRAM for you. Ernie I know you don't want to get into quarter-by-quarter but I'm kind of curious as how we should think about linearity of that bit growth from here on out for this fiscal year for both DRAM and NAND.  And I kind of ask the question because specifically for DRAM if it's kind of the linear growth rate it just seems like the February numbers are still embedding some very conservative assumptions around pricing given how good the environment is. So how do I think about that dynamics?
Ernie Maddock: I think you're going to see us make some steady quarter-on-quarter growth. But I don't think in DRAM particularly you're going to see it continued at the levels that you’ve seen it for the last couple of quarters. And I think the best guidance we can provide is that we're going to be roughly year-on-year to get to our targets, we're going to need to be at or slightly above 50% in terms of bit growth year-on-year. I mean we've just given you a pretty big number for Q1. So that math is getting easier and easier to work out. I would also tell you relative to some of the pricing, you will note that we widened our revenue guidance range a little bit and that's reflective of a bigger business and the fact that we realized pricing environment continues to be dynamic. So we did try to reflect our best thinking in the guidance that we've provided to you.
John Pitzer: Perfect, thanks guys. And congratulations on the strong results. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jagadish Iyer of Summit Redstone. Your question please. 
Jagadish Iyer: Yes thanks so much for taking my question. So first question Mark or Ernie how should we think about cost reduction for Gen Two NAND versus your Gen One? And when do you think it might become visible for you guys?
Mark Durcan: Yeah well, on full conversion I think of it as roughly doubling the bits for wafer and think of a cost down in the range of greater than 30%. So it's a big transition, but it's also as we mentioned will start to become significant until later in fiscal 2017.
Mark Durcan: Okay. And then on the DRAM front, I just wanted to find out if there is going to be any meaningful wafer capacity additions for Micron in fiscal '17. Is there a fab where you have some additional headroom for you to invest or should you invest in new greenfield? Thank you.
Mark Durcan: We're very focused on the technology upgrades that we were talking about with John a minute ago. That's where we have the biggest bank for the buck. We do have some clean room space around the network, but we have no plans to add new wafers this year.
Jagadish Iyer: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur of JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon guys and solid job on the quarterly execution and also congrats on the 600 basis point inflection in NAND gross margins. If we focus on this clearly 3D bit crossover was a big driver going forward, as I think about more cost per bit decline. Do you still have the benefits of continued higher 3D mix higher TLC 3D mix on Gen One. Question here is when should we expect TLC 3D crossover with 3D MLC. Is that going to be this quarter?
Mark Durcan: Yeah it definitely will be in this quarter in aggregate we expect TLC to be greater than 50% of the 3D bits.
Harlan Sur: Great, thanks for that. And then at the product level based off of third party estimates the enterprise SSD market is about a $10 billion market growing at about 25% year-over-year for the next few years, you guys have low single-digits market share while your JV partner has about 35% market share here high capacity status the biggest portion of this market you just announced the 5100 series that’s 3D TLC.  Can you guys just give us a sense on when you’re going to start shipping this in volume production are the large hyper scale guys that’ll be customers here? And just given what looks to be a step up in the roadmaps and maybe some of your customer feedback, do you guys anticipating growing your share here in the enterprise space in 2017?
Mark Durcan: Yes, we are definitely plan to grow our share. As you point out the fact that our share is relatively small in those segments today means there is a lot of opportunity, we do have what we think is a much better product portfolio analysis there’s a lot of customer excitement and eagerness. And we think that we’re well positioned with long-term customers who really want to buy from Micron. So yes.
Harlan Sur: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Romit Shah of Nomura. Your line is open. 
Romit Shah: Yes, thank you. I just wanted to ask a question about gross margin that the guidance is much better than expected. I am just -- I am curious how would you suggest we think about the gross margin potential of Micron considering your mix cost roadmap and whatever price -- base line pricing assumptions you’re making is last cycles your peak gross margins sort of a good guide post for us or are you thinking about it differently?
Ernie Maddock: Well that’s a question that got a thousand relative comparisons in it and what I would tell you is look we are a different company than in the last peak we have a higher mix of NAND, where we have a technology progression that we’ve tried to share with you. So certainly I think we have outlined our cost reductions over the next three quarters or so.  If you take the broad guidance we have provided, we’ve provided bit growth targets and you get to overlay of pricing environments and from that drive a gross margin profile. But I would expect if you have a similar market you’re going to continue to see opportunity for us to expand our gross margins. 
Romit Shah: Okay, thanks Ernie. And then can I also ask you, what’s the net operating -- the NOL balance today? And can you just educate us on restriction in terms of utilizing net asset against future tax progressions?
Ernie Maddock: Yes, it’s somewhere in the $4 billion plus or minus range and one of the reasons that -- and we’re very focused on protecting that NOL, which is the reason we put our NOL rights plan in place and it’s in the proxy now and up for shareholder review as well. And we intend to do everything we can do to continue to preserve our ability to use that because these are exactly the times that we want to have the ability to do that.
Romit Shah: Is it a $4 billion balance mean that whatever the tax rate is 5% is sort of the right way to think about your rate over the next several years.
Ernie Maddock: No because that would apply to you I think common earnings which are tax unfortunately to much higher rates than 5%.
Romit Shah: Okay, so you can only utilize it for U.S. income.
Ernie Maddock: That’s right. 
Romit Shah: Okay, got it. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the David Wong of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. 
David Wong: Thanks very much. Can you give us some idea of what you expect your debt and cash and equivalents might be at the end of the February quarter for along the Inotera payments? And apart from CapEx are there any significant post acquisition cash charges for restructuring or anything else to do with Inotera?
Ernie Maddock: So there are no significant restructuring charges anticipated. We borrow $2.5 billion relative to Inotera, so we would expect that to be somewhere -- total debt to be somewhere in the range of $12 billion, high $12 billion maybe $13 billion plus or minus there is a few little moving pieces around.  We are sitting here with cash this quarter at $4.3 billion there was a cash components of the transaction of about $500 million. And then we’ll generate operating cash flow and free cash flow in fiscal Q2 which we don't guide. So the result of that will be sort of where we’ll be at cash, but I would expect based on everything I know that it's reasonable to think flat or higher.
David Wong: Great, thanks very much. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Cassidy of Stifel. Your question please. 
Kevin Cassidy: Thank you. On your transition to the 1X DRAM process, will this be any different than past transitions? Meaning are you going to be coming out into the PC market first and then mobile or will these be targeted for certain markets.
Mark Durcan: We've got as I mentioned earlier Kevin we've got a broad spectrum of products. We're trying to make sure we get as many of them qualified early in the ramp as possible this time and do a slightly better job than we did at 20 nanometer. So actually we have sort of mobile and compute products coming and then we have sort of additional cost reduced and broader market applications behind that.
Kevin Cassidy: Okay great. And on your 3D cross point, you said that you'd have your first revenue in 2017. Can you state what end market that would be?
Mark Durcan: Sorry, can you repeat the question Kevin?
Kevin Cassidy: 3D cross point, what's your first end market for that?
Mark Durcan: We're talking to a number of different customers and we probably don't want to say yet.
Kevin Cassidy: Okay, congratulations on the great results and guidance. 
Mark Durcan: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Newman of Bernstein. Your line is open. 
Mark Newman: Hi, thanks and congrats on a great quarter. Question really about where we are in the cycle right now. Things look really great on pricing. I wonder and as also you mentioned inventory on the DRAM maintenance level also looks good. Do you have any comments on the inventory of the customers?  I'm wondering particularly on the Chinese smartphone OEMs have been buying quite a lot of memory through this second half of 2016. And I'm just wondering if you're seeing any double ordering any excess inventory on the customer side. Anything at all that makes you a little bit concerned of excess inventory either on the chip side or on the finished product side on especially on handsets?
Mark Durcan: Not really Mark. We've heard rumors along the lines of those that you're alluding to I believe. But we can't -- I can't validate those for you. Certainly in most market segments it's very, very tight. And anytime you have that and customers starting to get nervous about are they potentially getting a wind down et cetera. You always start to be concerned that people are just trying to get a little bit ahead of it build some inventory, I think that's only natural. I think we're doing a pretty good job of trying to allocate this product where it's absolutely most needed. And so I don't think too many people are building up too much inventory.
Mark Newman: Great thanks. And if you think back to the previous back in 2014 at the moment this feels very much like 2014 pricing strong, demand is good, supply demand movement is pretty tight. Anything different if you compare between now and then because now clearly what happened in 2015-16 wasn't quite what we were hoping for in terms of supply demand balance in pricing.  I was just wondering if you had any comments on what is different between the previous cycle? Clearly the industry is a lot better than the past, but the question is how much? And I'm just trying to ask if you had any particular thoughts of this time versus 2014 in particular. 
Mark Durcan: Well I think that part of what happened in the last latter stages of the last cycle where perhaps a little bit a miscalculation by one of the suppliers, but that they probably learned from so there is that. The biggest change structurally in the market though really is the fact that the products are going in a much broader set of end markets are much more broadly distributed now we’re three or four years on from where we were in the last cycle. And I think it does make a difference.
Mark Newman: Thanks very much.
Ernie Maddock: Mark I’ll add one more piece to that, which is sort of a long-term trend that we’ve talked about in the past in terms of slowing technology migrations, means that the competitors in the marketplace are likely doing math with numbers that are changing less rapidly than they used to be. So both from a demand and a supply perspective as those numbers get smaller and the slope gets smaller and a rate of change it gets a little bit easier to do the math and keep things in balance. And then finally you layer on what’s going on with NAND right now from a demand perspective, just explosive I think is probably the right word in terms of demand and elastic as well. And so I think there is maybe some insulation there that wasn’t there last time around. 
Mark Newman: Great, thanks very much.
Ivan Donaldson: Operator we have time for one more question.
Operator: Yes sir, our next question comes from C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI. Your question please. 
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Ida [ph] calling in for C.J. question. Another questions on XPoint, can you talk about whether you see that product impacting DRAM demand down the road?
Mark Durcan: A question on export, is that. Not early no, the question was asked who we are ship to first, we are not tell you who we are going to ship to first, but longer term it’s storage, it’s datacenter and it’s mobile applications all of those. I think early on it’s pure additive demand from the overall memory market. So we get two or three years in and have more substantial ramp going on the cost reduction. Yes I think it will overtime cannibalize part of the DRAM business.
Unidentified Analyst: And second question, in terms of the NAND channel inventory, who is that looking right now?
Mark Durcan: Very tight, very tight, customers are quite concerned. 
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. 
Ivan Donaldson: Thank you everyone. This now concludes Micron Technology’s first quarter 2017 financial release conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Abigail and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Micron Technology’s Fourth Quarter 2016 Financial Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Ivan Donaldson. Sir, you may begin your conference.
Ivan Donaldson: Thank you. And welcome to Micron Technology’s fourth quarter and 2016 fiscal year financial release conference call. On the call today with me are Mark Durcan, CEO and Director; and Ernie Maddock, Chief Financial Officer. This conference call, including audio and slides, is also being webcast from our Investor Relations website at investors.micron.com. In addition, our website contains an earnings press release filed a short while ago and supplemental information including quarterly operational and financial metrics and guidance, GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations, slides used during today’s conference call, and a convertible debt and capped call dilution table. Today’s call will be approximately 60 minutes in length. A webcast replay will be available on our website for one year. We encourage you to monitor our website at micron.com throughout the quarter for the most current information on the Company, including information on the various financial conferences that we will be attending. You can also follow us on Twitter @MicronTech. As a reminder, the matters we will be discussing today, includes forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today. We refer you to the documents the Company files with the SEC, specifically our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for a complete discussion of these important risk factors and other risks that may affect our future results. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after today’s call to conform these statements to actual results. I’ll now turn the call over to Mark.
Mark Durcan: Thank you, Ivan. For fiscal Q4 2016, Micron posted total revenue of $3.2 billion with gross margin of 18% and a non-GAAP net loss of $56 million or $0.05 per share. Both revenue and gross margin were at the high end of the guidance range and together generated earnings per share that exceeded guidance. Operating cash flow was $896 million. On the last call, we reported that while we were seeing signs of improvement in selected markets, we were uncertain of the extent and the duration of the improvements. During the quarter, we continue to see market conditions improve driven by both supply and demand fundamentals. Industry inventory appears lean and the current market outlook for both NAND and DRAM continues to be positive. Currently prices are increasing in number of segments, stabilizing in others and we’re seeing fewer segments showing residual declines. This environment frames our thinking and the guidance that Ernie will provide a little later on. We made significant progress on a number of key initiatives in the quarter including the completion of the mobile product qualifications that we’ve been discussing in our early 1X nanometer DRAM deployment. We’re also seeing the benefits of the 3D NAND yield ramp, which generated stronger than expected NAND bit growth in the quarter. I’m going to provide a high level overview of each of the business units and Ernie will follow with more details on each business’s financial performance. In our compute and networking business unit, we experienced accelerating revenue growth in the face of moderating pricing environment. Revenue growth was driven by continued increases of 20-nanometer shipments as well as a significant transition to DDR4 and the cloud and client segments where shipments exceeded DDR3 for the first time. We saw ongoing strength to graphics driven by GDDR5 and 5-X products, which supported NVIDIA’s introduction of the 5-X based TITAN X, the highest performance consumer graphics card in the market. In the enterprise segment, Micron was recognized at the Flash Memory Summit as the innovation leader in non-volatile DIMMs, an important solution of high performance servers. Turning to our mobile business unit, China is becoming a more significant growth driver in mobile devices. Most of these devices are differentiated by large amounts of memory including up to 6 gigabytes low power DRAM. Additionally, the top of the line Apple and Samsung models now ship with 256 gigabytes of NAND and we see mid range Chinese handsets heading in the same direction in order to compete. Although there is a moderating pace of smartphone unit growth, significant content increases of both NAND and DRAM will generate strong overall bit growth. During the quarter, we introduced four new mid to high density mobile 3D NAND products with positive reviews from the press and from our customer base. Mobile DRAM and eMCP price declines moderated in the quarter with more recent signs of stabilization and increases. Revenue growth in our embedded business unit has been driven by a record automotive business and increased performance in the consumer and connected homes segments as well as the strengthening industrial multimarket business during the quarter. We have maintained our leadership position in automotive through strong customer support and the introduction of new products that meet the fast growing memory content requirements for infotainment, ADAS and instrument cluster applications. High temperature DRAM and automotive grade NAND products are enabling a strong design win pipeline. The introduction of several new industrial solutions has positioned us to grow our share within IMM and retain our high market share in machine to machine communication modules as the industry migrates from 2G to 4G and LTE. We’ve also been successful in achieving strong market share positions in consumer applications from action cameras and home automation to high volume markets including digital TV and set top boxes. Finally, our storage business unit is continuing to transition its product line to our leading edge 3D NAND technology. We’ve seen positive response from customers this quarter related to our refreshed SSD portfolio which offers a breadth of solutions to meet diverse application requirements. We’re finalizing qualification with eight major OEMs on our 1,100 client drive and are engaging with cloud customers on future designs. In the enterprise, we’re seeing companies begin to retrofit HDD infrastructures with SAS SSDs as they modernize existing investments. Our customers and demand executives like financial services and energy are moving stores closer to the server. We have seen significant interest in our PCIe NVMe drives in these applications due to their ability to deliver very consistent high performance. We’re actively extending TLC 3D NAND across our cloud and enterprise portfolio and expect to introduce our first TLC 3D SATA drive for these markets later this year followed by a server focused version early next year. We expect to see positive supply and demand dynamics in the SSD market for 2017. Turning to the memory industry more generally, we’ve seen further evidence that DRAM wafer output is declining as a result of lost throughput related to the 20-nanometer and 1X nanometer conversions. Absent some replacement of these wafers, we could see industry supply growth as low as mid-teens in 2017. As some of lost wafer output is replaced, industry supply growth could be in the high-teens percent range. This compares to our long-term bit demand growth forecast in the low to mid 20% range.  For NAND, we estimate 2017 industry bit growth in the high 30% to low 40% range, which is in line with 2016. This compares to our long-term bit demand growth forecast in the low to mid 40% range. Despite significant investments in 3D conversions across the industry, we believe that 2017 supply growth will be relatively balanced with demand given the disruption in the fab output related to these conversions. For our operational priorities for fiscal 2017, or our operational priorities for fiscal 2017 continue to be targeted at ramping advanced technologies with an added focus on building out a more robust product portfolio, in particular for non-volatile memory products. For DRAM, we begin the 1X nanometer ramp and expect to have meaningful output by the middle of 2017. At our winter Analyst Day, we shared two-year bit growth targets for DRAM and we are on track to meet to these targets. We were slightly below the range in fiscal 2017 (sic) [2016] and expect to be above the range in fiscal 2017. All of the DRAM bit growth will come from technology transitions and we currently have no plans to add wafer capacity. We expect our fiscal 2017 DRAM cost per bit to decline 20% to 25%, as a result of completing the 20-nanometer migration and initiating the 1X nanometer conversion. Our cash cost for bit declines will be meaningfully higher than this range. For NAND, we will continue to focus on ramping our Gen 1 3D as well as TLC. As we updated at our last Analyst Meeting, 3D bit output will exceed 2D output in the current quarter ahead of our initial target. We will also be working on deploying second generation 64 layer 3D technology. Similar to DRAM, our 2016 NAND bit growth came in below the two-year CAGR shared at our analyst event and we therefore expect 2017 to be above that range. We are forecasting our fiscal 2017 NAND cost per bit to decline 20% to 25% as a result of the 3D and TLC conversions. This cost per bit includes the impact of our planned build out of SSDs, eMCPs and Managed NAND solutions all of which carry additional bill of materials costs but will also enable a richer ASP mix. On a like-for-like basis, cost per bit will decline more substantially. Relative to 3D Xpoint technology, we are working with market enablers on adoption of our QuantX solutions and continue to believe this innovative technology will be an important contributor to Micron’s future success with initial revenue later in 2017. Now, I would like to turn the mic over to Ernie.
Ernie Maddock: Thank you, Mark. We had a solid end to our fiscal year as our continued focus on execution coupled with a more favorable business environment resulted in improved financial performance. I’ll begin my comments today with some technology and business unit details followed by an overview of the Company’s results for the quarter and guidance for our first fiscal quarter 2017. DRAM represented 60% of our total revenue with the following segmentation. Mobile represented about 25%, similar to the prior quarter; the PC segment was in the upper 20% range, up slightly from the prior quarter; server business was in the high teens percent range, down from the prior quarter; and specialty DRAM, which includes networking, graphics, auto and other embedded technologies, was in the low 30% range, up from the prior quarter and primarily driven by an increase in graphics which represented more than 10% for the quarter. In our non-volatile memory business, trade revenue represented 31% of total revenue with the following segmentation. Consumer, which includes memory cards, USB and components, represented about 50%, down slightly from the prior quarter; mobile was in the high teens percent range, up from 13% in the prior quarter as we began to see the impact of our completed customer quals. As a remainder eMCPs are primarily in the Mobile segment. SSDs represented 13% similar to last quarter and the automotive, industrial, multi market and other embedded applications were in the high-teens percent range similar to prior quarter. Turning to performance by business unit, the compute & networking business unit delivered fiscal Q4 revenue of $1.25 billion, up 14% sequentially, primarily driven by 20-nanometer shipment growth accompanied by strengthening demand in a moderating pricing environment across all segments. The non-GAAP operating loss was $7 million or less than 1% of revenue. In the enterprise segment, conversions to DDR4 are now largely complete and we are focused on enabling our solutions for the next generation server platform. We are seeing continued interest in both higher density RDIMMs and LRDIMMs as well as NVDIMM solutions. The cloud component of the enterprise segment is growing quickly driven by continued growth in density across both DDR3 and DDR4 solutions. In graphics, we saw a growth well above typical seasonality, driven by our GDDR5 and GDDR5-X products. There are additional G5-X based product announcements from NVIDIA in both the graphics and workstation segments during the quarter. In networking, we enjoyed double digit revenue growth with strength across all regions and growing interest in applying the high bandwidth capabilities of GDDR5 and GDDR5-X to the networking segment. Finally within the client segment, we saw market demand which exceeded our expectation as well as a continued transition to DDR4 which for the first time represented a majority of client shipments. The mobile business unit delivered fiscal Q4 revenue of $671 million, up 20% sequentially, driven by a strong quarter in our eMCP products. The non-GAAP operating loss was $45 million or 7% of revenue and was partially impacted by the consumption of higher cost early production inventory accumulated over the last two quarters. We saw significant growth in the recently qualified higher density MCPs and as smartphone OEMS are positioning their products based on higher memory density specifications, which is helping to accelerate adoption of smartphones with richer memory content. The embedded business unit delivered fiscal Q4 revenue of $513 million, up 5% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating income was $133 million or 26% of revenue. The results were primarily driven by record automotive and increasing consumer business combined with some recovery in our industrial multi-market business. The automotive business delivered solid results with revenue up 6% sequentially driven by strong and increasing demand for both DRAM and eMMC solutions for infotainment, instrument cluster and advanced driver assistance systems applications. European, Korean and Japanese customers continue to fuel this growth and our portfolio of leading edge automotive grade solutions is continuing to enable platform design wins. The industrial and multi-market business increased 16% sequentially, primarily driven by the ramp of our NAND solutions into the Japanese amusement market. In addition, we continue to see strong demand for our NOR and NAND based MCPs used in machine-to-machine wireless communication modules. Consumer and connected home revenue was up 7% sequentially with solid demand for MCPs used in action cameras and home automation applications. We continue to see this demand pattern continue in the current fiscal quarter, which typically sees strong seasonal demand. Our 20-nanometer DDR4 products continue to ramp into set-top boxes and IMM applications. The storage business delivered fiscal Q4 revenue of $758 million, up 5% sequentially. The non-GAAP operating loss was $69 million or 9% of revenue. During the quarter, we entered production and OEM qualification of TLC 3D NAND-based SSDs in the clients and consumer segments, providing customers with a refreshed 3D-based portfolio as storage products expand the demand spectrum in these markets. In the enterprise SSD segment, consecutive quarter bits sold were up 45% based on higher sales of our planar MLC based cloud drive. We are deploying 3D TLC across the enterprise nm cloud portfolio with several product launches over the next two quarters. Moving on to overall company results, revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter was $3.2 billion at the top end of our guided range and up 11% sequentially. Fairly significant increases in volume shipments for DRAM were offset by moderating ASP declines, while trade NAND shipments increased as a result of early success of our 3D ramp and we experienced generally stable ASPs. Gross margin for the quarter was 18% also at the top end of our guided range. The non-GAAP net loss for the quarter was $56 million or $0.05 per share, significantly better than the guidance. For the full fiscal year, we achieved non-GAAP profitability despite our technology transition and memory market pricing pressure achieving non-GAAP net income of $66 million or $0.06 per share. As a reminder, Micron included both amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock compensation expense in our fiscal Q4 non-GAAP results. Taken together, these two items represent $0.04 a share in the fourth fiscal quarter and $0.20 per share for the full 2016 fiscal year. Turning to results by product line, DRAM revenue increased 13% compared to the prior quarter, as a result of a 20% increase in bit shipments, partially offset by a 6% decrease in ASPs. DRAM gross margins for the fourth quarter increased two percentage points to 20%, primarily driven by strong cost reductions as a result of the continued 20-nanometer ramp. Our non-volatile trade revenue increased 12% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting a 13% increase in bit shipments, partially offset by a 1% decrease in ASPs. Gross margin decreased a couple of percentage points to 16% as cost per bit was up related to the 3D ramp and build out of higher cost storage and mobile solutions to support future growth. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $559 million. This was below our guidance, primarily due to continued expense control and the timing of prequalification expenses for the fourth quarter, some of which will now occur in fiscal Q1. The Company generated operating cash flow of $896 million, which included strong quarter for collection activity and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable investments of approximately $4.8 billion. In the fourth fiscal quarter, capital expenditures net of partner contributes were approximately $1.7 billion. Before I move on to our guidance for the upcoming quarter, I want to share some changes to our reporting. The first of these changes relates to the depreciation schedule for our DRAM capital equipment. Previously, this equipment had been depreciated over five years. However, given the longer intervals between technology transitions, we have changed the depreciable life of our DRAM capital equipment from five years to seven years. This change will reduce depreciation by approximately 100 million per quarter on a going forward basis. The depreciation schedule for NAND related equipment remains unchanged. Additionally, and to be consistent with the majority of semiconductor companies who report non-GAAP results, Micron will exclude stock-based compensation and the amortization of acquisition related intangibles from our non-GAAP reporting. These expenses on average are approximately $50 million per quarter. Moving on now to our guidance for the first fiscal quarter, which we developed in the context of the market environment that Mark described earlier, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following: Consolidated revenue in the range of $3.55 billion to $3.85 billion; gross margin in the range of 23% to 25.5%; operating expenses between $600 million and $650 million due to the resumption of variable compensation expense and the higher pre-qual expenses that we spoke of earlier. Taken together, these items represent a sequential increase of approximately $80 million of which $25 million resulted from the timing of pre-qual between fiscal Q4 and fiscal Q1. Operating income in the range of $245 million to $330 million, and EPS ranging between $0.13 and $0.21 per share based on 1,046 million diluted shares. Relative to our capital spending plans for fiscal ‘17, as we shared last month, we expect to spend between $4.8 billion and $5.2 billion net of partner contributions. Between 40% and 50% of the total will be allocated to DRAM; between 30% and 40% to non-volatile memory; and between 15% and 25% to technology and product enablement. Consistent with our public comments, this level of CapEx allows us to appropriately fund our technology investments while achieving neutral to positive free cash flow generation in fiscal 2017. Operationally, we are on track to deliver the bit growth and cost per bit reduction targets that we previously shared as we complete the 20-nanometer DRAM conversion, reach crossover of first generation 3D NAND this quarter and commence the ramp of 1X nanometer DRAM and second generation 3D NAND in 2017. For FY17 specifically, we expect DRAM and NAND cost per bit reductions between 20% and 25%. Finally relative to the Inotera transaction, Micron and Inotera have concluded that sufficient progress has been made in Inotera addressing the issues that caused the delay in closing. An Inotera board meeting has been scheduled for October 11th and the directors of Inotera are expected to set a share swap record date at that meeting. We anticipate that the share swap record date will be set for the first half of December of 2016. With that I’ll turn it back to Mark.
Mark Durcan: Thank you, Ernie. To summarize, we faced challenging market conditions in fiscal 2016 and envision to going through a transition period of our technology migrations. Despite these headwinds, we ended the year with positive non-GAAP EPS. Compared to prior cycles, this represents a material improvement in our performance and further reinforces our belief in structural industry improvements. We are now experiencing a more positive and improving environment, and Micron is committed to making even further improvements in our relative performance with enhanced growth and cost reductions and expanded capability to deliver value added products to enable our customers. Okay, operator, we are now ready to begin Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is open.
C.J. Muse: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question Ernie for you on the pricing front. I know you don’t want to go into specific details but curious if you think about November, what you’re embedding in terms of I guess changes to mix and perhaps any flow-through of lower margin inventory, and any other kind of factors that we should be thinking about as it relates to DRAM ASPs?
Mark Durcan: This is Mark. Maybe I’ll take that one C.J. Certainly relative to the sell-through of inventory, there is an impact there, given some of the inventory we built up over the last couple of quarters relative to the qualifications we mentioned. Relative to market assumptions, we’re not going to get into the detail as always of the embedded margin because we don’t want to forecast the ASPs. But I think it’s fair to say that we’re seeing some early signs of significant price movements. And as we’ve done in the past, we want to wait before we get ahead of ourselves in projecting what may come as we move further out into the quarter but I do think that the trend is positive and the bias is positive.
C.J. Muse: It’s really helpful. I guess as my follow up, how do you think about channel inventory today? And I guess this is another DRAM question. And then as part of that how do you expect customers to act as you look into 2017 in an environment where bit supply is sub-20% and demand presumably higher than that? How do you expect the kind of changes in behavior there? Thank you.
Mark Durcan: Certainly if we think about inventory in the marketplace, certainly channel inventory I think is very, very tight, maybe one to two weeks or less than a week. At the major customers, we have less precision relative to that but I’d say, it’s certainly down and there is a sense of urgency at the large OEM customers as well. In some cases, we may be looking at allocation of certain products in certain markets. And certainly the customers are beginning to ask for longer-term price commitments, which is in my mind always a good thing. And we’ll look at those on a case-by-case basis and potentially take customers up on that where appropriate but obviously always keeping the long-term interest of shareholders in mind.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura. Your line is open.
Romit Shah: Yes. I just want to come back to the guidance because it’s something that people are trying to sort of gauge given that last quarter at least relative to how you originally guided, you guys came in a lot better. And I know at the time that there was a lot of moving pieces and you guys wanted to give yourself cushion. So, could you talk a little bit about visibility and at least on the pricing front if we could get a sense just directionally how you are thinking about ASPs in the November period? And then I have a follow-up.
Ernie Maddock: Romit, sure. This is Ernie. So, I think it’s important to acknowledge that although we beat our EPS guidance, we actually were well in the ranges of both our revenue and our gross margin guidance. And so, we did think about the opportunity that was ahead of ourselves as we were giving the guidance for the last quarter and we’ve done the same thing in essence this quarter as well. So, I think you can look at the range of our guidance and it generally contemplates the outcomes that we see. And obviously if things continue on a strong and favorable momentum, it’s reasonable to think that you’d end up at the upper end of both pieces of the range which would generate a result similar to this quarter. And I think consistent with Mark’s prior comments, we are continuing to see positive momentum. I do think it’s important to understand that that momentum has existed and has started to strengthen and so as a result of its actual impact in our fiscal quarter with part of it already completed and we’re in negotiations for others, I think the trap we want to avoid is presuming that whatever the latest pricing news is gets retroactively applied across the entire quarter because that’s certainly not the environment that we’re living in. But I do think we were pretty thoughtful about the revenue range. And obviously we’re going to work hard and try to do as well as we can but we’ve put a lot of thought behind the numbers we have just shared with you.
Romit Shah: Yes, that’s helpful. And then, Mark, I have a strategic question for you which is you talk about one of the priorities being to just ramp advanced products in non-volatile memory but at the same time sort of implicit in the fiscal 2017 free cash flow guidance is that you -- at least the way I’m interpreting it is that you’ll continue to burn cash in NAND. And so I guess my question is at what point do you consider a partnership to lessen the period expense and the CapEx burden associated with running this business?
Mark Durcan: We’re always looking for ways to improve our relative competitive position. And we’ve used partnerships and strategic relationships extensively in the past. We’ll continue to evaluate that and again always with the long-term in mind. We are -- there is an embedded assumption in there. There are lots of opportunities out there today. And I think I would not try to dissuade you of that view of life. I would just caution you that we are going to be pretty careful and deliberate about making sure we take a long-term view relative to the relationships and the partnerships we engage in and we are doing something that really drives a long-term strategic benefit for the Company as opposed to a short-term fix, more supply in the marketplace.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Mark Delaney: First question is I mean you could update us on the Inotera transaction, and if that were to close, if you could help us to understand the potential accretion or dilution from that transaction? And then related to it, to what extent is Inotera closing already embedded in of the financial guidance that you gave for fiscal ‘17?
Ernie Maddock: So, as we had in our prepared remarks, we do expect the transaction to close at this point, sometime in the middle of December. We did contemplate that timing in our guidance, so it doesn’t really have a dramatic impact on our FQ1 guide at all. And certainly, the transaction will continue to be accretive to gross margins and continues to be accretive to free cash flow. And essentially the EPS accretion is really dependant on how we choose to finance that last billion dollar component which we don’t have to make a decision on until about 30 days or so prior to closing. So, as we said before, we have the option of using equity or convert or cash or a combination of those. And so the specific EPS accretion will really be dependent upon what we finally decide for those things.
Mark Delaney: And then, a clarification on your comments that Micron will be above the CAGR that is provided for DRAM and bit growth in fiscal ‘17. I just want to clarify you would expect to be above the high end of your guidance for both the DRAM and NAND, so I mean I think it was over 30% in DRAM for fiscal ‘17 and over 40% in NAND for fiscal ‘17?
Ernie Maddock: What we said, Mark, was that we’ve given these two-year CAGRs and we were slightly below for both NAND and DRAM in fiscal ‘16. So, it’s reasonable to think that would be slightly above the range that we provided in fiscal ‘17, so that we over the two-year CAGR fulfill the commitment that we made around those bit growth CAGRs. So yes that’s a reasonable thing to assume.
Mark Delaney: That’s very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen. Your line is open.
Timothy Arcuri: Thank you. I had two. Ernie, I am still little confused on the guidance. If I try to adjust for the changes in the reporting, it sounds like you are excluding about $150 million per quarter now. So on an apples to apples basis, the guidance is actually like $0.13 or something like that lower than what the headline number is or more like $0.04 at the midpoint; am I not thinking about that right?
Ernie Maddock: Yes. That’s a reasonable way to think about it. Sure, Tim.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay. And then, I guess that leads me to the question about OpEx because it seems like some of that’s related to OpEx. So, I guess if you add the stock comp back and you assume that’s mostly OpEx, you are guiding to like 650 to 700, but it sounds like maybe 80 million of that is really one-time in nature; so, maybe the baseline is more like 600 million going into next quarter, is that -- sorry going into the fiscal Q2, is that the right run rate headed into the January quarter?
Ernie Maddock: So, let me sort of try to frame that for you a little bit. We had a couple of things that are impacting this quarter’s OpEx. The first was that about 25 million, give or take, are pre-qual expenses that we’ve planned to spend in FQ4 are appearing in FQ1. And then secondly, we have -- we had even prior to this rollover, the highest point of pre-qual expenses for the entire fiscal year was actually occurring in Q1, plus we have the resumption of variable compensation given the new pricing environment. And so what we’ve tried to frame for folks is sequentially between the variable comp being reinstated, as well as the pre-qual expenses, that’s a sequential increase of about $80 million from FQ4 to FQ1, so that predominately explains the change to the OpEx. And then certainly we’re hopeful that the variable compensation piece continues, because we’re hopeful that the business environment is favorable. And we would expect pre-qual expenses to moderate such that we should be in that range of 600 plus or minus, so probably midpoint around 600, a few quarters, maybe couple of quarters higher, couple of quarters a little bit lower under the new framework for reporting OpEx. So, those numbers would still exclude stock-based comp, but you would expect to see a pretty meaningful moderation of OpEx as we go forward throughout the year as a result of this pre-qual situation being resolved from the rollover.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Your line is open.
Ian Ing: Yes, thank you. Congrats on the guidance. DRAM question here, you’ve got favorable contract pricing; you didn’t quite get the bit output acceleration in Q4. Just wanted to understand that a bit and are there any shortages in terms of meeting customer demand at this point?
Ernie Maddock: I think part of the explanation of Q4 bit growth being slightly below, I think what we previously talked about was in fact that as we watched the market evolve we made some choices around where we’d like that output to be. And the result is that our Q1 -- fiscal Q1 bit output is now going to be higher than what we had expected it to be. So, obviously that did play into our thinking as we saw market evolve. Relative to specific shortages, I’m not aware of any. I don’t know Mark if you are. But certainly, all of our customers are being very attentive to making sure that their supply needs are taking care of. And we are seeing certain segments and certain customers where the possibility of allocation is present.
Mark Durcan: I don’t think we want to call this out today on this call, but there is certainly that risk.
Ian Ing: Okay, thanks. And for my follow-up here, server as a percent of DRAM that is down sequentially and August is -- what’s happening here, perhaps enterprise is offsetting the cloud? And shouldn’t this be a pretty attractive market to serve? I think pricing and server typically tracks PCs with a little bit of lag.
Mark Durcan: Yes. I think it will reaccelerate relatively quickly. It has been a little bit more of a lumpy business here over the last year or so, but we like the trends there.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Rajvindra Gill: Yes. Thanks and congrats on good execution. Just a question on the inventory increase on a year-over-year basis relative to the revenue increase year-over-year based on your guidance. So, it seems like that the inventory is increasing at a faster clip than revenue. So, just wanted to get a sense in terms of any concerns you see there? So, is inventory outgrowing revenue on a year-over-year basis?
Ernie Maddock: I think you have a couple of things. First, as we’ve talked about in the last quarter or so, as we’re ramping on the new technologies and predominantly because of these delayed mobile calls, we had some inventory built up that is now flowing through. However, we absolutely still continue to get more-and-more output from the factory and it’s going to be a couple of quarters before that inventory actually starts to decline, but we have a very clear view of an ability to decrease inventory meaningfully over the course of fiscal ‘17. I’d also remind you that we are also building supply chains for SSDs and MCPs which take longer in terms of their aggregate end-to-end cycle time than selling components. So, we have that effect as well. That will cap out here in the next quarter or so and then you’ll see normalization and a flow through of that as well. So, we’re not -- we’re cognizant of the inventory position, we’d like to think that we anticipated that and share that with you. And we’re equally confident that the inventory will decline nearly every quarter in fiscal ‘17.
Mark Durcan: Yes. To be honest, we feel pretty good about where we sit, given the trends in the marketplace as well. And we don’t feel quite as much urgency as we might under different market conditions.
Rajvindra Gill: And just last question from me on the cash flow, and obviously you can’t talk little bit about fiscal year ‘17. But if you kind of take your CapEx guidance and your depreciation add back, it does seem like it still will be kind of difficult to generate a meaningful free cash flow next year, assuming a fairly big ramp in gross margins and revenue, gross margins maybe to continue to increase above and beyond what you’re guiding for November. So, I just wanted to get a sense of how you’re looking at free cash flow. And Inotera agreement, how much free cash flow does that add to the Company, add that back on?
Ernie Maddock: On average, the Inotera transaction is going to add somewhere between $300 million and $600 million of cash flow on a free cash flow basis, but I’d really trust that that’s an average amount which would be sort of the free cash flow net of the incremental depreciation -- I’m sorry, the incremental CapEx. But I think that the best way I could -- the guys are thinking there is that we’ve prepared pretty conservative plan and we have a free cash flow neutral position in the context of that conservative plan. Obviously Q4 is a little bit stronger; it’s fair to say that Q1 was a little bit stronger as we look at it now versus our conservative plan. And so, we would expect to be able to accumulate cash over the course of 2017 if in fact this current market environment continues. Anytime we use words like significant, it gets hard to determine what’s significant to you or significant to me, but trust me every dollar is significant to us. And so, we’re being very careful and monitoring that very carefully.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Harlan Sur: NAND cost per bit was actually up slightly in Q4. Was this mix related? Maybe you could just tell us what cost per bit declines were on a like for like basis? And should we anticipate an acceleration of cost per bit starting here in the first quarter especially I think as you mentioned you get 3D bit crossover over 2D? But it seems like to me as gross margins for NAND should be inflecting up here in Q1 but I’m trying to get a sense for that.
Mark Durcan: A lot of moving pieces, Harlan; I think just to get to the crux of your question, yes, you should anticipate cost per bit start coming down nicely with the 3D ramp as we start flushing those wafers through the backend and out in the marketplace. Costs are coming down nicely this quarter and we continue roadmap ahead for that as we move through the year.
Ernie Maddock: Yes. And we’ve provided a cost per bit reduction forecast for the year to you. And I everything Mark said is absolutely true and counterbalancing that just a bit is this supply chain build up that I talked about because as MCPs and those SSDs have a higher COGS component, theoretically, they’re also generating more margin but if we’re only looking at the cost perspective, that will have a tendency to dampen the cost for bit reduction because the mix has changed.
Harlan Sur: Great, thanks for the insights there. And then, on the 1X DRAM ramp that you highlighted in your slides, when does that ramp actually commence; is it end of this year, beginning of next calendar year? And you’ve mentioned also that you expect significant output by middle of next year and maybe you can just be more specific on when you expect bit cost over 1X versus 20-nanometer. Thank you.
Mark Durcan: So, we have -- we actually have wafers in manufacturing fabs in both Hiroshima and Taiwan that are yielding. The output today is insignificant. We’ll continue to run engineering pilot line lots. And by the time we get to the middle of next year, you should see the significant terms of our overall output. I think probably got to wait another quarter before we give you little bit more precision on what the -- when the bit crossover might be.
Harlan Sur: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open.
Steven Fox: Just two questions from me, just following on that prior question regarding NAND cost per bits and all the mix issues. Can you just take that one step forward and talk about maybe how the storage business unit starts to recover in terms of profitability; is there a path to turning profitable this fiscal year? And then secondly, can you just talk about seasonality this year maybe versus last year in terms of what kind of unit shipments you’re seeing versus content shipments from some of your core markets and whether it’s stronger or weaker than a year ago? Thanks.
Ernie Maddock: So, let me address the question about the storage business. We are certainly hopeful that we can exit the year at least with a profitable note for the storage business. I think it’s dependent on a few things. Obviously we’re in the middle of a very significant portfolio sort of change out and we have to execute on those. So, far our record has been good with respect to the client and consumer segments, but we have some big product launches with respect to both data center and enterprise coming up here toward the end of this calendar year and in early calendar ‘17. And those would be really pivotal to us in completing that transition. I think that again track record has been great, the SSDs have been well-reviewed and we’re very optimistic that our subsequent product launches will be equally successful. I also think it’s important to keep in mind that we also are seeing the benefit of 3D in the memory -- I’m sorry, in the mobile business unit as well. We saw that -- we had the mobile percentage of our NAND business this quarter move from the low teen essentially to the high teens as a result of more and more calls [ph] there and the increasing importance of the MCP portfolio. So, we are seeing the benefit of that really across multiple business units.
Mark Durcan: Let me just add to that on the seasonality question. Q4 obviously typically is a very strong quarter for NAND. Hard to know for sure but our sense is that the demand picture probably has more staying power than just the typical seasonality that you see, given the strong growth in the end applications.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel. Your line is open.
Kevin Cassidy: Your guidance for first quarter is significant increase over fourth quarter. Can you give us a ranking of the end markets or the end products that are driving the increase?
Ernie Maddock: I’ll take that. So, obviously as has been the case, the sort of specialty markets, the embedded markets whether it’s automotive, industrial, medical probably top of the list within the computing and networking segment, graphics has been quite strong, server probably next and then followed up with mobile and client.
Kevin Cassidy: Okay. And are you seeing a significant increase with 3D NAND versus the planar NAND?
Mark Durcan: In terms of demand?
Kevin Cassidy: No, growth. I am sorry.
Mark Durcan: It’s a very quickly moving dynamic right now. So, yes, we’re seeing that happen sort of real time as we sell through the early production and move more and more of the products into the TLC format.
Ernie Maddock: And certainly more of that opportunity is ahead of us than it is behind us given that we’re just going to hit bit crossover for 3D in this quarter. And as Mark said, we’re continuing to transition, which adds cost because it suppresses output. But with more significant bit growth ahead, we expect the cost reduction opportunity to accelerate a little bit here throughout fiscal 2017.
Kevin Cassidy: Okay, great. Congratulations on good results.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Pitzer: I guess I want to go back to the cost side of the equation, guys. I guess just given the change in the depreciation schedule for the November quarter, I would have thought your ability to get gross margin to kind of the high 20% range especially in this pricing environment would have been fairly easy. So, I’m just kind of curious as to what the offsets are in the November quarter. Is this all about the calls on mobile and if it is, what do you adjust to make that to be a hit to gross margins and when might that be done? And then, Ernie, I know you gave full year cost targets on a per bit basis, could you give the fiscal first quarter? If you did I missed them.
Mark Durcan: I think, John, actually it’s really a little bit more about the lag that you typically see as pricing starts to turnaround as some of these things. Yes, there is an inventory effect relative to some of these products that we’ve built up in inventory that we’re early product on either 20-nanometer or 3D NAND etcetera as we sell through that’s a little bit of a headwind until that’s flushed out. But it’s really more around as ASPs turn around, they will turn around instantaneously and they didn’t turn around until end of the quarter last quarter. So remember, we had a pretty significant feed relative to the midpoint of our guidance last quarter, which gives you an indication that pricing was starting to accelerate then. It takes little while to play out and to start to [ph] do as we see these things happen. So, the trends are all in place. I think we are heading where you think where we ought to be. But it can take a little while to play out through the financials.
Ernie Maddock: Yes, and I didn’t provide a cost specific cost per bit target for FQ1.
John Pitzer: Okay. And I guess as my follow-up, Mark, just on the Inotera acquisition, if you go back and look at what you guys have tried to accomplish over the last kind of seven, eight years, it’s actually been to try to mitigate the cyclicality of the industry within your financials by setting up some of these JVs. Buying Inotera kind of reverses that. I am kind of curious, is this purely a financial decision on your part? You mentioned in your prepared comments that this downturn troughed at much higher levels than past downturns. So, does that give you the confidence or is there actually a fundamental reason to own the asset; will this allow you to kind of ramp 1X, or 1Y or 1Z more quickly on Inotera? If you just give a justification that would be great.
Mark Durcan: Yes. There is a lot of components to it. I think you put your finger on a piece of it which is the volatility in this business I think we can conclude is going to be less going forward. This certainly seems to have been born out as we move through this last cycle. It doesn’t mean that cycles are gone, it just means that the volatility is less. So that is less of a defensive driver, so to speak. An important thing for us in this whole picture is operational flexibility and control. As we think about our ability to drive new technologies, either in the manufacturing or to transition technologies with the Inotera assets, how the ownership of that asset and the ability to mix and match different technologies as well as potentially more value add products and capture that value is significant. Notwithstanding the fact we have a good operating relationship with Inotera, we believe that there is more value we can bring as sole owners than as board members and operational partners. And at the end of the day, it gives us the ability as well to take cash flow that’s going to be generated with Inotera and to put it across our network where we find that most useful. So number of different factors play into it, all of which I think point in direction that we are moving.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Ernie, just going back to your CapEx for the next fiscal year, it sounds like you are incrementally more confident with the Inotera deal. And in that context, how should we think about the incremental CapEx requirement for Inotera? In the context of your comment that in Inotera would help with free cash accretion, I’m just trying to reconcile everything. And I have a follow-up.
Ernie Maddock: So, when we provided that CapEx guidance of essentially midpoint of 5 billion net of partner contributions, we did say it included contemplated investments from Inotera. So, that’s an all-in number. And as you know, we don’t break out specific CapEx by fab. So, we don’t plan to start doing that now. But that 5 billion midpoint with a little range around that is inclusive of anticipated investments at Inotera.
Mehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thanks for clarification. And then, with the 3D NAND and the crossover with 3D NAND, should I assume that all the 3D NAND capacity coming on line is TLC or is this clearly MLC left in the mix?
Ernie Maddock: No. The first out 3D was MLC but we very quickly introduced TLC. And as we said in our prepared remarks, most of our client consumer SSDs are now out on TLC and we’re qualifying the TLC into some mobile applications as well and we will be majority TLC by the middle of fiscal ‘17 here as we go forward. So that’s part of the engine of the significant bit growth that we’ve contemplated and forecast.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the decision to move to seven-year depreciable life on DRAM. I guess that strikes me as a long time. And I look at your CapEx ratio, PP&E sort of a third. What was the thinking my seven years and can you remind us the depreciation life of the NAND equipment?
Ernie Maddock: So, the depreciation life of the NAND equipment is about five years. And really, we conducted quite an extensive study around how long the technology transitions existed or took in the DRAM world, how long they were contemplated to take on a going forward basis, we looked at the practices of others, both competitors and partners. But really the substance of the decision was related to what we anticipate and what we’ve been saying for some time is a sort of slowing of the technology transitions and therefore the longer useability of that equipment as the technology transition times change. And the reality is there is a range of answers you come up with when you do a study like that. And much like the midpoint of guided range in seven years felt to us like it was not overly aggressive, but not overly conservative either. So, you could assume that we could have gone a year or two on either side of that and we chose a position that we thought was reasonable given what we know and understand about the pace of technology transition.
Joe Moore: Okay, great. Thank you for that. And then as a follow-up, have you given or can you give an absolute number for depreciation for either the quarter or for the fiscal year?
Ernie Maddock: We expect depreciation to be somewhere in the range of $4 billion for the year give or take.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you very much.
Ernie Maddock: And operator, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
David Wong: Thanks very much. Ernie, are you noting that you might be able to generate cash over the next few quarters? Can you give us any idea what you would do with any net cash generated; would you be able to pay down debt or other uses of cash?
Ernie Maddock: Certainly, first thing we’re going to be focused on is actually accumulating the cash. So, that’s my first priority because I have to have some of it to be able to decide what to do with it. And certainly at that point in time, we would certainly look at the opportunities that were available to delver and we would look at those in the context of everything else that’s going around. And it’s really impossible to say specifically what we would decide to do in the context of a future that’s not yet here. But I can tell you that delevering is an important priority. And depending on how much cash we generate, we may choose to deploy a 100 million of that or so back into CapEx, if that’s the right decision, but delevering is certainly nearest and dearest to our hearts at the moment.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s Micron Technology fourth quarter 2016 financial release conference call. You may now disconnect.

We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after today’s date to conform these statements to actual results. I will now turn the call over to Mark.
Mark Durcan: Thanks, Ivan. For fiscal Q3 2016, Micron posted total revenue of $2.9 billion with gross margin of 17%, a non-GAAP net loss of $79 million and a non-GAAP loss of $0.08 per share, all within our guided range. Operating cash flow was $389 million. Top line results were primarily impacted by continued weakness in the PC segment and the mobile qualifications we discussed last quarter. With recent data points indicating some improvement in channel pricing, an expectation of finalizing our mobile qualifications and continued progress on our technology and operational milestones, we remain confident about our opportunities. Today, I would like to provide a brief overview of our progress in each of the businesses and Ernie will cover other business unit performance details. In our Compute and Networking business unit, we returned to revenue growth despite pricing pressure in the client segment. This was driven by the ongoing ramp of our 20-nanometer products, which exceeded 25-nanometer shipments on a bit basis for the first time. We enjoyed continued 20-nanometer qualifications across all CMB market segments led by our 8-gigabit DDR4 product in enterprise, cloud and client. In May, NVIDIA launched the world’s fastest consumer graphics card designed with Micron’s GDDR5 X. We are excited about the prospects for this high-performance memory product. In enterprise and cloud, we saw initial customer announcements based on our NVDIMM product offering with high-performance persistent memory. Turning to our Mobile business unit, our results continue to be impacted by the timing of product qualifications as we transition customers to 20-nanometer versions of LPDDR4. We have successfully concluded some of the delayed qualifications that we discussed last quarter and we anticipate finalizing the remainder during fiscal Q4. We are ramping the output of these products throughout the quarter and into fiscal Q1 2017. We anticipate continued demand growth in mobile market in the fourth quarter in terms of both NAND and LP DRAM. In our Embedded business unit, the automotive segment delivered record revenue, driven by volume increases in DDR3 and increasing density mix in the eMMC. Density activity remains strong with recent qualifications of automotive consumer and connected home applications. In the consumer MCP business, we saw some recovery, but we expect to continue into fiscal Q4 aligning with seasonal demand. And finally, our Storage business unit is in the midst of refreshing its SSD portfolio with a higher capacity 3D NAND memory technology. We also introduced Micron Accelerated Solutions, which are enabled by our enterprise SSDs and advanced DRAM, integrating compute and storage to improve efficiency and performance in a variety of storage applications. And we announced our new 110 SATA client SSDs, leveraging triple levels cell 3D NAND for class leading performance and power efficiency. To summarize, our leading edge technology deployment continues to progress throughout manufacturing for both DRAM and NAND and we are on track with our bit growth and cost reduction targets. We believe the combination of new products with more efficient manufacturing on advanced nodes will drive improvement in our competitive position in the rest of 2016 and beyond. Turning to the memory industry more generally, we believe that the DRAM industry supply growth will be in the low to mid 20% range in 2016, which is consistent with our prior commentary. If wafer output declines in the latter half of the year as some parties have forecast, we would expect to exit the year on a slower run-rate and 2017 bit supply growth could be in the mid to high-teens. This compares to our long-term bit demand forecast in the low to mid-20% range. The significant improvements we are seeing in channel pricing are not currently impacting other segments. And as a result, we continue to take a conservative view of the market environment. For NAND, we estimate 2016 industry bit supply growth in the mid 30% to low 40% range with a similar range in 2017 as early 3D conversions create some temporary supply constraints. Over the last several quarters, we have experienced strong demand coupled with aggressive pricing as suppliers have been driving to increased penetration rates and densities. Similar to DRAM, the current channel pricing environment appears to be improving, but has not yet significantly impacted across other segments. Our long-term bit demand forecast is in the low 40% range as lower cost and higher performance 3D NAND solutions enter the market. From an operations perspective, Micron remains focused on a few key priorities. For DRAM, we successfully achieved our targeted 20-nanometer crossover during fiscal Q3 and also enabled our 1X node in manufacturing. We expect to ramp 1X nanometer DRAM in volume starting in 2017. We are forecasting – we are still forecasting Micron’s fiscal year 2016 and 2017 DRAM bit growth in the 28% to 30% range, which is likely above the market. We achieved 22% bit growth in fiscal Q3 and expect even stronger bit growth in Q4. In light of current market conditions, we had no plans to add DRAM wafer capacity. As noted above, we are migrating to advanced technology nodes in order to achieve cost reductions and adjust higher density designs for mobile, cloud and enterprise segments. For NAND, we continue to make great progress on our Gen 1 3D NAND and are reaching maturity yields ahead of expectations. We still expect to achieve 3D bit crossover by this fall, which will allow us to take advantage of the cost benefits that this technology provides. Our second generation 3D product is also on track with initial production this quarter. Equally exciting is that we expect TLC to be the majority of our 3D bit output within the next few quarters. In aggregate, we are forecasting Micron’s fiscal year 2016 and 2017 NAND bit growth in the 30% to 40% range. We expect to be somewhat below the market in 2016 and somewhat above the market in 2017. TLC enabled 3D NAND technology is a big step forward and a significant driver relative to the progress we expect to make in our NAND business. This technology progress must be complemented by enabling product solutions for key storage and mobile segments. We have outlined the storage product roadmap, which includes our recently announced client SSDs, followed by cloud drives later this year and enterprise solutions early next year. We are also evaluating a number of mobile product opportunities for 3D NAND in 2017. Relative to 3D XPoint, we are working with market enablers across a number of market segments and continue to believe this innovative technology will be a strong contributor to Micron’s future success with revenue in 2017 and beyond. Micron has a committed focus on the deployment of advanced technology to drive manufacturing efficiency and enable innovative new products for our customers. While we haven’t finalized our fiscal year 2017 business plan, we are approaching that plan with prudence and conservatism and carefully reviewing our capital investments and projected operating cash flows to ensure the appropriate balance. Now, I would like to turn it over to Ernie.
Ernie Maddock: Thanks Mark. I will start off by sharing technology and business unit details and circle back to the overall company results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. DRAM represented 60% of our total revenue with the following segmentation. Mobile was in the mid 20% range. The PC segment represented about 25%. The server business was in the low 20% range. And specialty DRAM, which includes networking, graphics, auto and other embedded technologies, was in the high 20% range. In our nonvolatile memory business, trade revenue represented 31% of total revenue represented 31% of total revenue with the following segmentation; Consumer, which includes memory cards, USB and components, represented about 55%. Mobile and SSDs each represented approximately 13%. And as a reminder, eMCPs are accounted for in the Mobile segment. The automotive, industrial, multi market and other embedded applications were in the high-teens percent range. Moving on, I will share a brief operational summary of each of our business units. Micron’s compute and networking business unit posted fiscal Q3 revenue of $1.09 billion, up 4% from the previous quarter, primarily driven by our 20-nanometer shipment growth across all segments and partially offset by lower average selling prices. Our non-GAAP operating loss was $63 million or 6% of revenue. In the Enterprise segment, demand for our 20-nanometer 32 gigabit DDR4 RDAM was driven by the launch of Intel’s latest server platform. We also saw solid growth in the Cloud segment with continued transition to DDR4. In graphics, we saw strong growth driven by our GDDR5 and GDDR5X products and are approaching a seasonally strong period for graphics applications, including virtual reality and expect good performance from this segment for the next quarter. In networking our business was somewhat flat, however we made significant progress enabling our 20-nanometer products and also announced our eUSB 3.0 solution. Finally, within the client segment, we continued enablement and volume ramp of our 20-nanometer, 4 gigabit DDR3 and 8 gigabit DDR4 solution to all major OEMs. In Micron’s mobile business unit, we posted fiscal Q3 revenue of $561 million, up 12% from the prior quarter, as we continue to ramp 20-nanometer LPDDR3 and LPDDR4. While the low density eMCP market is still under pressure, a move to higher density designs in FQ 4 and early FY ‘17 should help stabilize and improve this segment. Our non-GAAP operating loss was $17 million or 3% of revenue. We have successfully concluded some of the delayed qualifications that we discussed last quarter and we anticipate finalizing the remainder during fiscal Q4. This work will allow us to more fully ramp our 20-nanometer mobile products in fiscal Q4 and into next year. Both LPDRAM and NAND content continued to increase in mobile devices, which when combined with even modest unit growth, will result in very solid bit consumption. In our embedded business, we posted fiscal Q3 revenue of $487 million, up 6% from the previous quarter, with a non-GAAP operating income of $107 million or 22% of revenue. The results were primarily driven by continued strength in the automotive and consumer segments, offset by softness in the industrial multi-market segment. In our Automotive segment, we achieved record revenue increasing 6% quarter-over-quarter and 10% year-on-year. We continue to see increasing demand in both DRAM and eMMC applications that include infotainment, instrument cluster and advanced driver assist systems and continued to see strong demand from our EMEA customers which was more recently complemented by growth in Korea and demand recovery in North America. Our portfolio of leading edge solutions is enabling major 2018 platform automotive design wins. Our industrial multi-market business declined 9% quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to global market softness in the manufacturing infrastructure segment. However, we continue to see healthy demand for our NOR and NAND based MCPs used in machine-to-machine wireless communication modules. Our consumer and connected home revenue was up 3% quarter-over-quarter with some softness in the set-top box business, offset by strong demand for NAND and LPDRAM MCPs to support action camera and home automation applications. As we enter into a seasonally strong period, we expect demand continue to grow. Customers are also beginning to design and ramp our 20-nanometer DDR4 products into set-top box applications. Micron storage business unit posted fiscal Q3 revenue of $719 million, down 20% from the previous quarter with a non-GAAP operating loss of $62 million or 9% of revenue. As we transition to lower cost 3D NAND products, we continue to optimize our product mix. In clients and consumer SSD, consecutive quarter bits sold were down 20% as we reduced production of planar NAND based SSDs while ramping volume production of 3D NAND based SATA and PCIE clients and consumer SSDs. These new products will enable the company to enhance its competitive position. In the Enterprise and Data Center SSD segments consecutive quarter bits sold were down 10%. As we have previously noted, our 3D NAND solutions will improve our product portfolio in this segment, enabling us to participate more significantly in this important growth business for the company. Now looking at the company overall, as Mark noted earlier, revenue for the third quarter was $2.9 billion, which was near the midpoint of our guided range and roughly flat compared to the prior quarter. Fairly significant increases in volume shipments for DRAM were offset by decreases in selling prices while trade NAND shipments declined as we are in the middle of a significant conversion from planar to the 3D NAND. Gross margin for the quarter was 17% within our guided range. The non-GAAP net loss for the third quarter was $79 million or $0.08 per share, slightly better than the midpoints of our guided range. As a reminder, Micron includes both amortization of acquisition intangibles and stock compensation expense in our non-GAAP results. Taken together, these two items represent $0.05 per share for the recently completed quarter. Now let’s look at results by product line. DRAM revenue increased 9% compared to the second quarter as a result of the 22% increase in bit shipments, partially offset by lower selling prices. As the results of our 20-nanometer ramp and ongoing mobile qualification timeline, DRAM finished goods inventory increased during the quarter. DRAM gross margins for the third quarter decreased approximately two percentage points to 18%, as decreases in ASPs outpaced significant cost reductions. Our non-volatile trade revenue decreased 15% compared to the second quarter, reflecting a 10% decrease in bit shipments combined with a 6% decrease in ASPs. Gross margin decreased a couple of percentage points to 17% as ASP reductions outpaced cost per bit reductions. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter came in at $523 million below our guided range due to the reversal of accrued cost for variable compensation plans, which were suspended in the third quarter. The company generated operating cash flow of $389 million and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable investments of approximately $5.7 billion. Expenditures for PP&E during the quarter were $1.7 billion and we continue to expect our fiscal 2016 capital expenditures to be in the range of $5 billion to $5.5 billion net of partner contributions. During the quarter, we received approximately $2 billion from the issuance of secured notes and an additional $114 million in equipment financing. Also, we resolved the long outstanding tax matter, which resulted in a $52 million benefit to the tax line. This benefit was offset by the write-off of a related $30 million receivable that was reflected as non-operating expense. In the third quarter, we also acquired Photronics interest in our captive mass operations for $93 million resulting in 100% ownership of the mask operations. Moving on to our guidance for the fourth quarter, on a non-GAAP basis we expect the following: Consolidated revenue in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.2 billion, gross margin in the range of 15.5% to 18%, operating expenses between $580 million and $630 million and operating loss ranging between $135 million and $55 million and an EPS loss ranging between $0.24 and $0.16 per share based on 1.036 billion diluted shares. Operationally, we are on track to achieve the bit growth and cost per bit reduction that we previously shared as we continue to ramp our 20-nanometer DRAM and 3D NAND production. In recognition of the current business environment and the need to accelerate focus on the company’s key priorities, we plan to implement the cost saving program, which we expect will save the company approximately $80 million per quarter in fiscal 2017. The savings will result from a combination of our more focused set of projects and programs, the permanent closure of a material number of open headcount requisition and a workforce reduction in certain areas of the business, as well as other non-headcount related spending reductions. About half of these savings will appear in the gross margin line of the company while the remainder will be reflected in operating expenses. These savings are baseline against our previously planned 2017 fiscal spend levels. We expect to take reserves approximating $70 million for the cost of this program, the majority of which will occur in fiscal Q4 with the remainder in the early part of fiscal 2017. As we complete our fiscal 2017 planning process, we are mindful of the need to effectively balance period spending, CapEx and free cash flow and we continue to explore other opportunities to improve the company’s financial performance. Finally, at this time, we don’t have any new information to share relative to Inotera. As we stated in our press release, the transaction will not be closing in mid July and we expect to provide an update during the latter part of the calendar year. With that, I will turn it back to Mark.
Mark Durcan: Thank you, Ernie. To summarize, we continue to navigate challenging market conditions, but remain confident in the long-term health of the industry and the company’s strategy to improve our relative competitive position. The decision to implement cost reduction initiatives is always difficult and is never made without thoughtful consideration about the short-term and the long-term impacts. However, to ensure that we can continue to place emphasis on our most important company priorities, we believe the steps Ernie outlined are prudent and will help deliver the best long-term results for the company. I would like to take a moment to thank our customers, partners, shareholders and team members for their continued support. Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho.
Vijay Rakesh: Yes, hi guys. Just a couple of questions here on the DRAM side, obviously, good bit growth there. But how do you – what’s the mix of 20-nanometer that you are shipping now and how do you see that as you progress through the August quarter? Do you see further cost reductions there? Thanks. I have one follow-up.
Mark Durcan: Yes. 20-nanometer is the majority of the bits that we are shipping now. And when we talked in our prepared remarks about the strong bit growth above Q3 levels, you saw what the relative growth was in Q3 and you can assume it will be a little bit north of that as we look at fiscal Q4.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. And on the 3D NAND side, obviously, it looks like bit growth was a little light obviously because of the transition. What’s your mix of 3D NAND that you are shipping now? And when do you see the transition and the bit growth start to open up for you on the NAND side?
Mark Durcan: Yes. I would say low double-digits today. As we commented – as we get into the back half of the calendar year, we expect a crossover. So, that’s coming pretty soon. So, it’s a pretty significant ramp from here over the next couple of quarters.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. And obviously, you guys are giving a blind estimate on the gross margin now, which is great. As you look at your mix with 20-nanometer costs coming down and 3D NAND PNC starting to ship, any thoughts on where do you see those margins start to bottom out? Thanks.
Mark Durcan: We typically don’t comment on margins, because it’s a function of our pricing environment just moving around on us everyday. And so really what we have said is that the cost curves that we articulated in our Analyst Day are still legitimate. As you can imagine, when we do 3D crossover and NAND in the fall, that’s when you expect to see the accelerated cost reductions begin to occur there. And on the DRAM side, with the kind of bit growth that we delivered in fiscal Q3 as well as what we are forecasting for fiscal Q4, you can get some idea of what the cost reductions would be there.
Vijay Rakesh: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer: Yes, good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Ernie, maybe just a follow-on to that margin question and I appreciate that margins are a function of pricing, which is hard to predict. But you have got a lot of elements moving in the right direction. Revenue is growing sequentially into the fiscal fourth quarter. You have got 20-nanometer mix. You have got more mobile. NAND has started to turn your way and yet you have got gross margins that are likely going to be down sequentially. Can you help me understand just kind of some of the factors around mix that are in play and kind of the narrative that we were hoping for is that this quarter, the May quarter and the August quarter would start to show some tangible evidence of you kind of closing the relative cost gap to some of your peers? And just given the gross margin guidance, it looks like that’s not happening and I am trying to figure out why?
Mark Durcan: Maybe, John, maybe I can take that one instead of Ernie. Again, on the pricing environment as you noted, we are seeing there is obviously encouraging things going on in the channel. Before we start making that into any sort of guidance we would give, we want to actually see that as it moves through other end market segments and out in the contract pricing etcetera, etcetera. So, really this was a question about the tailwinds we have and I think you did a nice job articulating for us. We have got – I think we have done a good job on the 20-nanometer ramp and we will continue to see some improvement for that as we move through the next quarter. We articulated pretty strong bit growth moving forward in both DRAM and in particular maybe a couple of quarters out in NAND as we really see that transition kick in and the 3D TLC part of that transition kick in. So, we have got a lot of good tailwinds. We also articulated we are making lot of good progress on qualifying and re-segmenting those more advanced technology nodes in the right market segments. And we do believe that you will see progress relative to our competition in terms of how our margins move. We never know exactly what they are going to do and it’s tough for us to predict what their results are going to look like given the pricing environment.
John Pitzer: That’s helpful, Mark. I appreciate it. And then Ernie, maybe if I follow on just on the OpEx guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter, a little bit higher than we thought. Can you help us understand are there some period expenses that are coming in? And then as you talk about the restructuring and the cost savings given that you kind of have that cost gap and you had a lot of initiatives on your plate for investing, how do we get comfortable that you are kind of taking cost out of the right areas and yet still investing in areas you need to invest?
Ernie Maddock: Sure. So, to the first part of your question, there are some very significant pre-qual expenses that we expect to incur in Q4 that are influencing the guidance that we have provided for the quarter’s OpEx. And then relative to the cost reduction, the only comfort perhaps I would offer you, which I hope is very strong comfort is that we actually think very carefully about what we are doing here and the decisions that we made with respect to the cost savings program were deliberated, very thoughtfully debated. And at the end, we believe we are the right balance to both help improve the financial performance of the company while at the same time not jeopardizing any of the company’s potential in terms of revenue opportunities.
Mark Durcan: John, maybe I can add one point there, just so everyone on the call is clear, I know you are. The preproduction R&D class Ernie is referencing are really associated with a lot of new products in qual with these technology nodes that are now ramped. And some of those are sort of costs that flow through the R&D now as opposed to directly on the cost flow and inventory.
John Pitzer: Perfect. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura Securities.
Romit Shah: Yes. Thanks Mark. You mentioned that channel pricing has improved. At what point would you start to see that show up in contract and in some of your other businesses, because it looks like just based on the guidance for August that you are not expecting the overall pricing environment better relative to May?
Mark Durcan: Well, it’s a very dynamic environment. So, again, we want to make sure we are giving you what we believe is realistic guidance and guidance that is achievable. And we are going to have to see what plays out in the markets over time. When contract – when spot pricing starts moving, that’s a great indicator of where the markets might go, but what has to happen obviously is there has to be enough liquidity in the market that can carry through into larger volume quarters associated with contract market. And inventory has to burn off. And we are seeing good indications of those types of things, but we need to make sure the pudding is fully baked before we serve it.
Romit Shah: Okay, that’s helpful. And then just on the pre-call expenses that are boosting OpEx this quarter, is that sort of more one-time in nature or do you expect expenses to sort of remain elevated through the course of the year as you ramp these new products?
Ernie Maddock: Well, certainly, they will occur as there is a concentration of new products. So you shouldn’t expect that they are going to occur each quarter. And I would tell you then in Q4, they are particularly high relative to what we have seen over the recent history as a reflection of what Mark said. But it is likely that some time during the course of 2017, you are also going to see these occur as we release new products. But again, we see a particularly high concentration in FQ4 ‘16.
Romit Shah: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri from Cowen and Company.
Tim Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I guess I had two questions, first of all, the NAND bits are really moving around a lot, obviously given the planar to the 3D move, so maybe you can hold our hand a little bit and on the 3D transition because it does sort of look like there has been some issues in the 3D transition looking at the bits and maybe also talk about what the bit outlook is for August in NAND to just sort give us some comfort that you are sort of getting through this transition?
Ernie Maddock: So Tim relative to – I will take the second part of your question first and then we will circle back around to the first. The stake in the ground is we have said a few things, which were actually we reiterated today that would kind of be in the opposite direction of thinking there were problems with our 3D NAND transition, right. We are seeing mature yields occurring at rates that are slightly faster than we anticipated. We had originally probably six months ago talked about big crossover for 3D at the end of the year. Today, we reiterated again that that was going to occur in the fall. So a pull forward of a couple of months. And so we are not going to give you a bit guidance for the August quarter, but we do think that these data points will hopefully give you comfort that in fact, the transition really is occurring slightly more rapidly than we have expected it to occur.
Mark Durcan: The thing I would add to that Tim, is keep in mind we have also talked about the fact that we want to deliver more of our NAND bits in actual solutions to the customer. And as we do that, there is a natural tendency to stretch out the supply chain in aggregate and some lengthening of the total manufacturing cycle time as we move through that transition. So part of this I think is also reflective of the fact that we are making some fairly significant progress relative to like getting these bits into the types of end products that we want to deliver to the customer.
Ernie Maddock: I think one final point that may be also contributing to the overall impression is we do see planar bits coming down fairly significantly as you move away from that planar SSD markets that we have sold into in the past. So there are many dynamics sort of at play here relative to what comes out as an aggregate bit number.
Tim Arcuri: Got it. And then just as the follow-up to that. Ernie, you talked at the Analyst Day, I think you said that $800 million of the CapEx this year would be for fab shell spending. So that sort of net of the partner contribution you would be sort of in the 4 to 4.5 range. And so – I am sorry, net of the partner contribution and also net of the fab shell spend would be in the sort of 4 to 4.5 range and so I am just kind of wondering, as you look to next year and I don’t – and I am not asking for guidance, but I am just wondering how you think about the maintenance CapEx level of the company given some of these initiatives you have in DRAM and also in 3D NAND, how do you sort of think about how to balance that? Thanks.
Mark Durcan: Well, you really asked kind of two different questions, right, how do we balance and obviously, the balance has come in as we think about the aggregate business for the company and the cash flow that we are planning to generate and a number of other factors. As we look at maintenance CapEx, we sort of said that we were normalized in that low $4 billion range ex-Inotera and we wouldn’t move away from that in a very substantial way as we are thinking about things today, bearing in mind that we are still in the midst of a ramp of 3D in the Singapore fab. So it isn’t exactly a normalized environment for us. Even taking out the shell, we are still outfitting that shell with productive capacity.
Tim Arcuri: Got it, okay. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Wong from Wells Fargo.
David Wong: Thank you very much. For the second generation 3D NAND, when you hit crossover in the fall for 3D NAND, will this all be on second generation technology or will it be first generation and what’s the difference in layer count between first and second generation, please?
Mark Durcan: So David, it will be primarily significant majority of that. In fact, almost all of it will still be Gen 1. Gen 2 we start to see significant output in the second calendar quarter into the summer of 2017. And we haven’t said what the layer count does, but we have indicated that it’s roughly a 30% cost reduction moving from Gen 1 to Gen 2 and it is roughly double the bit.
David Wong: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes in the line of Chris Hemmelgarn from Barclays.
Chris Hemmelgarn: Thanks very much for taking the question. I guess first of all, building on David’s question, as you are seeing 3D ramp across the industry, how do you view your competitive position and at your Analyst Day, you laid out some beliefs that you are going to have cost leadership, is that holding as you are seeing the competition ramp?
Mark Durcan: This is Mark. Yes, absolutely. We are very happy with the way the ramp is going. We are very happy with the technology we are delivering and its ability to scale going forward. We think it’s the best solution in the industry for almost every end market application.
Chris Hemmelgarn: Okay. And I guess to the harder question, what needs to happen for you guys to get back to sustain profitability, I mean I applaud the restructuring efforts, but I look at the savings you have announced and that fall short of the wash as you put up for the last two quarters and what you guided to the next quarter, are you confident these changes are going to be enough to get you back to profitability next year?
Mark Durcan: Well, we think we are doing all the right things. And we think we were making a lot of good progress on a relative competitive position on technology. But the products are all coming along nicely now and the qualifications are progressing well. So there is always the wildcard around ASPs, but we think we are making very significant progress and we think we will see that every quarter as we move forward, you will be able measure us versus our competition. And hopefully confirm that we are doing all the right things and exactly when that results in profitability, we can’t tell you, but we think its coming.
Chris Hemmelgarn: Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy from Stifel.
Kevin Cassidy: Thanks for taking my question. On the mobile side, as you start getting more qualification on the LPDDR3 and DDR4, are you expecting that – I guess what percentage of your revenue will be those products versus eMCP and what is it today?
Mark Durcan: Let me see it if I can find those numbers. I don’t have them right in front of me. For the mobile DRAM portfolio generally, eMCP probably represents...
Ernie Maddock: Well, I will jump in real quick, Mark. So, the way we break it out Kevin, is mobile DRAM discrete is reported in our DRAM business. And that’s about mid-20% of our total DRAM. Our eMCPs are reported in our NAND reporting segment. And we said mobile was in the mid-teens percent of the NAND business, mid to low – low to mid teens.
Kevin Cassidy: Okay. Maybe as you ship more of the LPDDR3 and 4s, are you expecting that your average selling price would increase?
Ernest Maddock: Again, it’s really challenging to give you a forecast of what’s going to happen with the pricing environment. But in terms of aggregate revenues, we would expect it, as we move through these qualifications, that you are going to see the mobile business maintain or slightly improve in terms of a percentage of its overall revenue to the business. And as we noted in our comments, right, as we see eMCP market moving to higher density, we think that, that will be sort of a starting point for an improvement in that aggregate market, which has been weak actually in the last couple of quarters and that’s a quarter or so off as we roll into calendar 2017.
Kevin Cassidy: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI.
C.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, first question on the mobility qualifications side, how much I guess is the uncertainty around timing there whether it’s the month of August or September, October impacting your gross margin guide? And then as part of that, how should we think about the incremental gross margins as you start selling down your inventory going forward once we do get to qualified?
Ernest Maddock: So, C.J., it’s Ernie. We are pretty clear on the qualification timeline. There is more uncertainty around the timing of shipments, because at the end of the day that is going to be a function of each of those customers sort of current inventory dynamics with respect to the inventories they have on hand, their success in the marketplace and how they want to position their inventory. And in addition to that, we are going to have as we already talked about significant quarter-on-quarter growth in production, some of which is directed toward that mobile market, because we believe that it’s fairly strong. So, mobile in general has a better gross margin profile than the aggregate business. So, as that product flows through, although there will be some early pressure as a result of that inventory having been built at a time when costs weren’t fully baked as a result of the volume ramp eventually it will flow through into the margin profile of the company.
C.J. Muse: Okay, that’s helpful. And I guess as a follow-up when you think about your 3D NAND cost structure, curious how you would compare that today versus the price leader in planar NAND and when you think you will crossover? Is that Gen 1 when you are fully ramped at high volume or is that more Gen 2 in the summertime next year?
Mark Durcan: Yes, I think it’s probably most closely timed to an increase in our TLC mix, which is probably a couple of quarters out and then we will get a second surge sort of in calendar Q2 and Q3 of next year as the Gen 2 kicks in, in a significant way. But again, we think we will be the leader as we fully implement Gen 2 and TLC.
C.J. Muse: Great. Thanks Mark.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.
Joe Moore: Yes, hi. Thank you. I wonder I just wanted to clarify when you talk about Q4 DRAM bit growth being better than Q3, that’s sequential bit growth north of 20%. And I guess that then implies when you look at revenue not growing very much that ASPs are down similarly. I know you don’t want to give a pricing forecast, but I just want to make sure I understand I am planning it hard to get to your revenue number with my pricing assumptions?
Mark Durcan: So, the first part of your assumption process, Joe, is correct. And again, we are not going to comment on ASPs.
Joe Moore: Okay. And then separately, can you talk about how the Inotera, the new pricing agreement factors into this? Is that a positive or a negative at this point relative to the old pricing agreement? And maybe if you could compare that versus a wholly owned situation if that deal in fact moves through? Just as any context you can give us around that dynamic?
Ernest Maddock: Sure. So, in the current pricing environment what we have contemplated as we look toward the Q4 is pretty much a wash to be honest with you, either way that the results to Micron would be roughly the same.
Joe Moore: Alright. Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I am still a little bit unclear as to the gross margin decline or the slight gross margin decline in the August quarter given that we have seen some stabilization in DRAM and NAND prices starting kind of in the month of June, your 20-nanometer mix and your 3D NAND mix is moving higher. So, I would assume that your blended costs are coming down nicely. You mentioned other parts of the market that may not be participating on the pricing stabilization that we are seeing in the PC market. But if I look at the end market demand parameters, data center, networking fundamentals seem to be improving into the second half. Embedded fundamentals seem to be seasonally up. Can you guys just articulate like what segments are still showing aggressive pricing declines?
Mark Durcan: Yes. So, let me try to characterize that a little bit for you. So, it is important to recognize that these data points are really happening in real time. And as we look at how we actually entered this quarter, we were actually starting the quarter below the average of the prior quarter and we are now seeing some upward trends that are causing everyone to have the enthusiasm that we are talking about, but it is important to understand that what we have been reading about in the last two weeks has a) not impacted the entirety of the quarter and b) hasn’t reflected itself yet as we look at forward pricing. And as Mark mentioned a couple of times, we really are wanting to provide prudent guidance in the context of an environment that’s moving around very, very significantly. The other point I would make is it is absolutely true that we are seeing strong bit growth and cost reductions on the DRAM side. Remember that we said the majority of the NAND cost reductions occur as we achieve that big crossover, which is later in the fall of this year. So, we are getting quarter-on-quarter cost productions in NAND, but I think you might be perhaps pulling towards that bit crossover comment into the full quarter that we are coming up on and that’s just not going to be the case.
Harlan Sur: Okay, appreciate the insights there. Maybe more of a product question for me next. I mean, if we include 2 in 1s, I think SSD and embedded NAND attach rates in notebook PCs are at or slightly above 50% now and continuing to climb. I think you guys had a target of having your 3D NAND base client SSD in the market in calendar Q3. Maybe if you can just give us an update there? And I think you guys also had a target to have your 3D NAND-based SATA solution, your high capacity drives for hyperscale drives starting in calendar Q4, if you could give us an update there as well? Thanks.
Mark Durcan: Well, they are both in the market. And we are going to just have to see what the demand looks like, but so far we like the reaction we are seeing.
Harlan Sur: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill from Needham & Company.
Rajvindra Gill: Yes, thanks for taking my question. On the whole 3D NAND conversion, I just wanted to get a better understanding of in your estimation what would be more cost effective that the 3D on 32-layer versus the 20-nanometer that’s currently on 2D NAND?
Mark Durcan: Definitely. The 3D 32-layer is cost advantaged relative to 20-nanometer, even 16-nanometer planar NAND. And we believe that as we move through time, the market is going to appreciate incremental value in 3D NAND bits as well.
Rajvindra Gill: But can you give us an idea in terms of if your 3D NAND is actually fitted for some of the applications as it will be available for applications such as mobile or embedded or cars?
Mark Durcan: Yes. We have a full product portfolio coming for 3D NAND that will address. And I think I mentioned this in my commentary we have 3D NAND products for consumer client datacenter and enterprise as well as evaluating mobile applications on a go forward basis.
Rajvindra Gill: Okay. And just last question on the mobile DRAM qualification issues, what specifically can you talk about it? Has there been quality issues with respect to your mobile DRAM, which is preventing you from getting qualified at certain customers and as a result losing market share to Samsung and….
Mark Durcan: You know I think we have gone through a very significant transition here, in some cases from 30-nanometer to 20-nanometer, in some cases from 25-nanometer to 20-nanometer. And from a timing perspective, in some cases, we were later with a particular either density or iode or interface that the customer is wanting. And so it’s just a matter of working through that process and qualifying both products in the various fabs that we are ramping. So I don’t think there is anything untoward or unusual in that process. It’s just a matter of a fairly significant ramp across two high volume fabs and taking the time to qualify a full suite of products across all those technologies.
Rajvindra Gill: And if I could just squeeze one more, in terms of kind of competitively as it relates to your other major competitors moving to a smaller process node and you guys perhaps perpetually plan to catch-up in terms of process node transition, kind of what are some of the lessons you think you guys have kind of understood from the 20-nanometer transition and trying to rectify that when you go to the other process node transition, just in general any comments there would be helpful? Thank you very much.
Mark Durcan: Yes. So certainly, we think 3D NAND has gone very, very well for that. For us, that has been really a model, where we take technology, we have developed in fab 4 and move it into a consistent equipment set in a historically Micron environment, where the equipment all matches and things go very, very well. What we had experienced in 20-nanometer is we are matching at this set of equipment, given the Elpida acquisition. So we have got one full set in Hiroshima, one full set in the MMT fab in Taichung and a separate tool set in the Inotera fab. And that’s just more complicated. And every time we make this transition, we get more and more of those tools aligned. And we feel like actually we are in pretty good shape now. And as we move to the 1X node beyond that, it’s going to be a lot more seamless and a lot easier to execute on a go forward basis. So we are – we think we are the leader in 3D and we think we are getting closer in DRAM and 1X is coming along now running at sort of pre-production levels in both Hiroshima and Taichung.
Rajvindra Gill: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Mark I am just looking at your NAND gross margin, it’s been below corporate average since mid-2013 and you have all of these new product qualification coming up, I am just wondering is there a strategic alternative here to make more it dramatic or to take a more dramatic action because it has been more than 2 years that NAND has been underperforming compared to the corporate average and in case these product qualifications don’t go well is there alternative strategy here? And I have a follow-up.
Mark Durcan: We are always open to looking at lots of different ways to optimize the business for the shareholders. Having said that, we like our NAND position, we like the technology. The early feedback from the customers is they like what we are doing, they like not only the 3D technology, but the product portfolio. And we think we are making progress. So we are kind of encouraged with the progress we have been making. Yes, we completely – we have admitted for 18 months now that we completely missed the boat on planar TLC. We think we have taken significant steps to remedy that on a go forward basis. And we intend to do so. So we are going to play it out. And as we do that, we will look at lots of different strategic options for the DRAM business, just like we do for the – sorry, for the NAND business, just like we do for the DRAM business and 3D cost plans and all the other interesting new technologies we are developing.
Mehdi Hosseini: Anyway you could share with us qualitatively or big picture what some of those options are?
Mark Durcan: Well, I think we will just keep those to ourselves, Mehdi. But I think the main point I would want to make to you is we think it’s important to have a diversified set of products or technologies to support memory system solutions for our customers. We think were in a strong position there. We like the growth profile associated with the non-volatile memory business generally and that includes not only NAND, not only 3D cross point business that we are currently developing, but also other advanced storage class memories we are working in. And we will look at lots of different ways of optimizing the value in all those different technologies. And we way may find different solutions in different segments, but we are always looking for those opportunities to create value added partnerships or new relationships.
Mehdi Hosseini: Got it. And then quickly for Ernie, how should we think about working capital inventory and accounts receivable, it seems like at least on the inventory side, it may not come down significantly until February quarter, is that a fair assumption or not?
Ernie Maddock: I think it’s reasonable to think about inventory being within a pretty narrow band for a couple of quarters. So I think that’s a reasonable thing to think about. And obviously, we pay a lot of attention to working capital and tend to do so on a going forward basis and my statement about inventories was on a dollar basis. So obviously bits are going to move around as costs move around.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. Thank you.
Ivan Donaldson: And operator I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: Certainly. Our final question for today comes from the line of Tristan Gerra from Baird.
Tristan Gerra: Hi, good afternoon. You have mentioned on the call today that the 3D NAND cost structure is laying to the TLC mix and you have mentioned a two quarter out timeframe for that mix ramp, is that in line with the Q4, fiscal Q4 target in terms of cost improvement in your NAND business that you provided last quarter or was there a little bit of a change in terms of where you expect an inflection point in your cost structure in NAND flash?
Mark Durcan: No, there is no change. We are – I think we are pretty consistent. The fiscal Q1 is our crossover, is aligned with our crossover in the fall, what we talked about today, which is a little earlier than we had originally talked about. The 3D crossover comes a little bit later. And that drives a surge in the cost improvement, but not necessarily to drive the improvements that we have kind of outlined relative to our guidance.
Tristan Gerra: Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up, any steps that you can talk about that you are taking to accelerate the node migration notably at Eldida?
Mark Durcan: The migration of DRAM from 20-nanometer to 1X?
Tristan Gerra: That’s right.
Mark Durcan: We are not completely done with 20-nanometer there yet. But as I mentioned a minute ago, we have 1X running there. It’s kind of where we have been doing our pilot line activity and we have transitioned, where we have transferred that technology into the Taichung fab and they are progressing with that. We wouldn’t expect to see volume starts in either Eldida or Taichung until later this year.
Tristan Gerra: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of – I am sorry that does conclude our conference for today. And we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.
Mark Durcan: Thank you everyone.

Mark Durcan: Thank you, Ivan. For our second fiscal quarter of 2016, Micron posted total revenue of $2.93 billion with gross margin of 20%, non-GAAP net loss of $48 million and a non-GAAP loss per share of $0.05, all within our guided range. Operating cash flow was $763 million. Our results were impacted by continued weakness in the PC market, seasonality and timing of product launches in certain market segments. We are continue -- we are simultaneously ramping qualifying and delivering several leading edge products including 20-nanometer DDR4, low-power DDR4, and 3D NAND based solutions. Our progress has been strong, but is always challenging to precisely align technology conversions and fab output with customer qualification cycles and market seasonality. Today I’d like to provide a high-level overview of our progress in each of the business units and have asked Ernie to cover business unit metrics and financial performance. In our Compute and Networking business unit, we recently achieved initial customer qualifications from our 20-nanometer 8 gigabyte DDR4 products. These are now ramping in volume. In the Enterprise, we’ve qualified an innovative NVDIMM solution at two major OEMs. In the Graphic segment, we’re enthusiastic about the early success of our GDDR5X a discrete solution for increasing data rates above 10-gigabits per second. We’ve several major design wins and expect to have the products available by the end of the current fiscal quarter. In the Networking segment, we are seeing early signs of demand recovery in China, where we believe our broad portfolio and strong customer engagements position us well for the future. Turning to our Mobile business unit, results have been negatively impacted by the timing of product qualification as we transition customers to 20-nanometer versions of LPDDR4 products. We do expect to finalize 20-nanometer low power DDR4 qualifications with most customers by the end of this quarter and this coupled with our expectation that memory demand across the smartphone categories will continue to expand, leaves us confident that our mobile business is well positioned for substantial growth by the fourth fiscal quarter of this year. In our Embedded business unit, automotive design-in activity remains strong, particularly with 20-nanometer DDR3 and low power DDR4 products. We’re seeing growth with automotive customers in greater Asia and continuing to build upon success with European and U.S manufacturers. We are also generating strong design-in activity for our industrial SSDs and we’re delivering a broad portfolio of differentiated Non-Volatile Memory, DRAM and MCP solutions to the Consumer and Connected Home segments. Finally, our Storage business unit has been positioning us product portfolio to take advantage of our high-performance 3D NAND technology. We are currently sampling Tier-1 OEMs with early versions of our 3D NAND enabled PCIe NVMe client SSDs. Over the next two quarters, we will be shipping crucial branded low-cost 3D NAND client SSDs, high-performance drives targeting gaming enthusiasts, and a 2 terabyte client OEM drive. In summary, the leading edge technology deployment is progressing well across manufacturing for both DRAM and NAND, and our bit growth and cost reduction targets are on track. We believe the combination of new products with more efficient manufacturing on advanced nodes will drive significant improvement in Micron’s relative competitive position in the second half of 2016 and beyond. Turning to the memory industry more generally, we believe that DRAM industry bit supply will decrease to the low to mid 20% range in 2016 and could drop a low 20% in 2017. Our estimate is based on slowing technology driven supply growth and no incremental wafer supply. Although the current environment remains challenging, we believe -- we continue to believe that longer term DRAM bit demand growth in the low to mid 20% range will result in healthy market fundamentals. For NAND, we estimate 2016 industry bit supply growth in the mid to high 30% range as early 3D conversions create some temporary supply constraints. We continue to expect the cost and performance advantages of 3D NAND will drive enhanced adoption rates and densities across key storage markets and we’re confident in Micron’s roadmap in 3D NAND in terms of timing, performance, and relative cost position. Internally and from our operations perspective, Micron remains focused on a few key operating priorities. For DRAM, we continue ramping 20-nanometer. This technology node will represent more than 50% of our fab bit output in the current fiscal quarter. We are enabling 1X DRAM in manufacturing and recently began transferring this technology to our Taiwan fab in Taichung. We expect to ramp 1X nanometer in volume starting in fiscal 2017. We are still forecasting our own fiscal year 2016 and 2017 DRAM bit growth CAGR in the 20% to 30% range. This is likely above the market. On current year bit growth, we will be weighted to the second half of fiscal year 2016 with substantial bit production output gains in fiscal Q3 and Q4. We currently have no plans to add DRAM wafer capacity, so any market share growth in DRAM will be the result of technology deployment. For NAND, we’re ramping Gen 1 3D NAND in Singapore and expect to have more than 50% of our NAND bit fab bit output on 3D by the fall of 2016. We are also enabling Gen 2 3D in manufacturing and expect to be in early production starting this summer. We are forecasting Micron’s fiscal year 2016 and 2017 NAND bit growth CAGR in the 30% to 40% range. We expect to be below the market in 2016, but well above the market in 2017. Most of this growth will be related to 3D and TLC conversions which will begin to deliver more substantial bit growth and cost reductions starting late in fiscal year 2017 – 2016, excuse me. We are planning for incremental capacity with our Singapore fab expansion and are beginning two installations this quarter. As always, we continue to be mindful of market conditions as we contemplate our investment decisions. Relative to 3D cross point, we’re working with market enablers and continue to believe this innovative technology will be a strong contributor to Micron’s future success. We continue to augment our controller and subsystem capabilities, and have made good progress in aligning this roadmap with our 3D NAND RAM. We expect to substantially expand our vertical -- vertically integrated solutions over the next 12 months. Now I’d like to turn it over to Ernie.
Ernie Maddock: Thank you, Mark. Before sharing our normal financial summary, I’ll cover more technology and business unit details. DRAM represents 54% of our total revenue with the following segmentation. Mobile was in the low 20% range, the PC segment was in the mid 20% range, the server business was in the low 20% range, and specialty DRAM which includes networking, graphics, auto, and other embedded technologies was in the high 20% range. And our Non-Volatile Memory business, trade revenue represented 37% of total revenue with the following segmentation. Consumer, which includes our memory cards, USB, and components, represented more than 50%. Mobile, including MCP was in the low teen percent range, while SSDs were in the mid teens percent range. Automotive and industrial multi-market segment and other embedded applications were in the mid teens percent range. Moving on, I’ll share a brief operational summary of each of our business units. First, CNBU. The Compute and Network business unit posted fiscal Q2 revenue of $1.05 billion, down 8% from the previous quarter impacted by lower average selling prices and continued softness in demand from the PC segment. Our non-GAAP operating loss was $55 million or 5%. Our high-value solutions from Enterprise, Networking, and Graphics market helps to offset some of this weakness. In the Enterprise and Cloud segment, we continue to see significant demand from our DDR4 solutions; specifically within the cloud segment we had record DDR4 shipments increasing our market share with key hyper-scale customers in Asia Pacific. Within the Enterprise segment, demand for our 32 gigabyte DDR4 RDIMM also gained significant traction with key customers. In Graphics, we continue to see demand softness; however, second half demand looks stronger for products such as our 20-nanometer 8 gig GDDR5 solution. In Networking, we also saw slowdown in demand as a result of lower LTE shipments during the quarter, but we’re expecting a recovery in the second half of the year. Finally, within the client segment, we achieved successful enablement and volume ramp of our 20-nanometer 4 gigabit DDR3 solutions. Also, we shipped samples of our 20-nanometer 8 gigabit DDR4 solution to all major OEMs and began high volume production. Micron’s Mobile business unit posted fiscal Q2 revenue of $503 million, down 40% from the prior quarter due to delayed customer qualifications and pricing pressure in the eMCP market. Our non-GAAP operating loss was $21 million or 4% of revenue. We expect some continued challenges during fiscal Q3 as we conclude our customer qualifications, but expect to see improved shipments during our fourth fiscal quarter. Bit shipments of eMCPs were down approximately 25% as we redirected bits to higher value homes. We saw strong LP DDR3 demand from China in mid tier phones and expect this demand will continue into next year. Looking forward, our Mobile portfolio continues to position us for growth and success, while we had some missteps in our Mobile qualifications in FQ2, we expect this situation to progressively improve during the calendar year. We continue to ramp our LPDDR4 solutions into both the flagship and high-end segments and will be introducing our innovative 3D NAND into flagships and some higher end phones in the second half of calendar 2016. The Embedded business unit posted fiscal Q2 revenue of $460 million, down 4% from the previous quarter with a non-GAAP operating income of $87 million or 19% of revenue. The results were primarily impacted by softness in demand from the consumer and industrial multi-market segments, offset by continued strength in the automotive segment. Looking ahead, we continue to see increasing demand in both DRAM and eMMC for automotive application that includes Infotainment, Instrument Cluster and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. In addition, our NOR XTRMFlash product introduced last quarter, continues to gain adoption with key chipset and system on-chip venders within the automotive ecosystem. Our Industrial multi-market segment, we’re seeing good design-in activity of our M500 IT industrial SSDs and specialty DRAM. And in the Connected Home segment, we’re seeing increased DRAM demand from key set top box customers in both Asia and North America. Micron Storage business unit posted fiscal Q2 revenue of $901 million, up 2% from the previous quarter with a non-GAAP operating loss of $80 million which represents 2% of revenue. We continue to optimize our product mix to address market challenges, particularly in the client and datacenter SSD segments. Our Trade NAND component bit growth was up 16% quarter-over-quarter and we see demand increasing driven by OEM enterprise solution providers and webscale customers who want to leverage the energy savings and performance gain enabled by Micron flash. In our Client and Consumer SSD segment, consecutive quarter bit growth was up 13% reflecting accelerated SSD adoption in OEM Ultrabook and Ultrathin PCs. In our Enterprise SSD segment, we’re starting to ship our S600 Series SaaS drive Micron’s first product produced through our strategic partnership with Seagate. We expect to realize revenue from this new product line in Q3 as we move into volume production. Finally, the Datacenter SSD market segment saw significant downward pricing pressure, driven by TLC enabled competitors and aggressive competition for hyper-scale business. Micron’s participation in this market has been measured and in the second quarter with strategically shifted bit supply from this segment to more favorable market margin opportunities. Looking at the Company overall, as Mark noted earlier, revenue for the second quarter was $2.93 billion which is at the low end of our guided range. Our revenues were impacted by seasonality, timing of product launches, and DRAM and NAND pricing pressure driven primarily by the PC end market. Gross margin for the quarter was 20%, 5 percentage points below the previous quarter and at the high-end of our guidance. The non-GAAP net loss for the second quarter was $48 million or $0.05 per share at the favorable end of our guided range. Gross margin reflects the pricing environment noted earlier, as well as the timing of our leading edge technology migrations. As we’ve noted before, these migrations will generate more substantial cost per bit reductions starting in FQ3 for DRAM and FQ4 for NAND. As a reminder, Micron includes both amortization of acquisition and tangibles and stock compensation expense in our non-GAAP reporting. Taken together, these two items represents $0.06 per share for the recently completed quarter. Looking at results by product line, DRAM revenue decreased 18% compared to the first fiscal quarter, primarily as a result of lower average selling prices and lower volume shipments. During the second quarter, DRAM bit inventories increased as a result of the 20-nanometer ramp and the timing of product qualifications with certain mobile customers. While we currently expect substantial growth in the volume of DRAM sales in Q3, we also expect an additional inventory increase that will become available for incremental revenue during the following quarters. The further market adoption of DDR4 products continued in the second quarter and represents approximately 26% of total DRAM volume sales. As a result of decreases in average selling prices, DRAM gross margin was lower than in our previous quarter at approximately 20%, while bit costs remain relatively flat. Our Non-Volatile Trade revenue decreased 6% compared to the first quarter as a result of the decrease in selling prices, partially offset by higher sales volume. Gross margin decreased a couple of percentage points as improvements in per bit cost nearly offset the decrease in selling prices. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter came in at $583 million, slightly below the midpoint of our guided range. The Company generated operating cash flow of $763 million during the second quarter and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable investments of approximately $5.1 billion. Expenditures for PP&E during the quarter were $1.2 billion and we continue to expect our fiscal 2016 capital expenditures to be in the $5 billion range net of partner contributions. During the second quarter, we borrowed approximately $425 million with equipment financing and also repaid the third installment on the former LP to creditor debt, bringing the total repayment to approximately half of the total debt. Moving now to our third fiscal quarter guidance on a non-GAAP basis we expect the following. Consolidated revenue in the range of $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion, gross margin in the range of 16.5% to 19%, operating expenses between $560 million and $610 million, operating income ranging between a loss of $70 million and income of 10 million, and an EPS range between a loss of $0.12 per share and a loss of $0.05 per share based on 1.36 billion diluted shares. Operationally we’re on track to achieve the bit growth and cost per bit reduction targets outlined in our recent Analyst Day. Along these lines, we expect strong double-digit bit growth and related cost reductions for DRAM in fiscal Q3 as a result of the deployment of our 20-nanometer technology. These trends will continue in future quarters along with the benefits of expected improvements in seasonality and further progress on our product qualifications. Our 3D NAND ramp in manufacturing is proceeding well and we expect to see significant bit growth and cost reductions starting in fiscal Q4. With that, I’ll turn it back over to Mark.
Mark Durcan: Thank you, Ernie. There is one additional thing I’d like to mention before opening up the call for questions. As you know Mark Adams resigned for health reasons at the beginning of the year. Rather than directly replacing his role, we’ve decided to make and are in the process of implementing some changes to our organizational structure that we believe will effectively ensure our ongoing competitiveness. To summarize, we continue to navigate challenging market conditions, and we’re working to match the timing of our leading edge output with the right mix of customers in end markets. We remain confident in the long-term health of the industry and our strategy to improve our relative competitive position. Operator, we’re now ready to begin Q&A.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Your question please.
Mark Delaney: Yes, good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. First question is on the inventory which I know Ernie you talked about increasing this quarter, then potentially again next question. Can you just talk about how you expect to work down inventory going forward and if you need to do anything on the utilization front in order to manage the inventory levels?
Ernie Maddock: No, we don’t expect to do anything on the utilization front and we think the substantial majority of the inventory will be work through in the fourth fiscal quarter with maybe a little bit carrying over into Q1, but we don’t foresee anything beyond that.
Mark Delaney: And then for a follow-up on the gross margin outlook for next quarter, can you just help us better understand some of the mechanics that are driving the decline and if any color between the different segments of how gross margins might trend?
Ernie Maddock: You know I think if you accept that the cost reductions are on track with what we articulated in our Analyst Day, really it sort of boils down to what your assumption is relative to the pricing environment and certainly we’ve embedded certain assumptions in our guided range and really want to make sure that we’re communicating that. The issue relates to an assumption around the pricing environment and not the realization of the cost reduction of the Company.
Mark Delaney: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is open.
Steven Fox: Thanks. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could just provide a little more color on the qualifications on the mobile side. Any issues as to why you sort of missed a window and why won’t penalize you maybe for more than a couple quarters? And then secondly, just on the client SSD business, if I look at numbers in terms of pricing in the last three months or so, you’re seeing pretty sharp ASP declines on average for client SSDs. I’m just curious given -- I know, I understand the cost basis is going down, but relative to those cost declines, how close are you to coming to acceptable margins once you get through the technology transition? Thanks.
Mark Durcan: Yes, so first relative to the qualification, obviously when you’re ramping multiple new fabs on new technology nodes and simultaneously transitioning to new densities and new IOs, it’s a complicated thing to keep everything completely aligned with all the various customer requirements and customer product rollouts, particularly in a design-in sort of more sticky environment like we experienced in the mobile segment. So really what we experience is more of a timing issue relative to some of those products and some of those customers, and we’re very confident that the product meets their needs. Its just a matter of now getting them queued up and through the qualification cycle. So, very confident that that we’ve a good handle on the timing and that’s why we continue to build those products and are confident holding the amount of inventory to cover that. Relative to the -- to client SSDs, you’re right. There has been significant pressure there. We have talked about strong double-digit growth in terms of our bit growth on NAND, on a go-forward basis. And given that, significant cost reductions have come with that as well as the strong ability to ramp TLC as we move late into the year with our 3D NAND. So, generally speaking we feel pretty good about where our NAND business goes as we move late into this year and into the next year.
Steven Fox: Okay. So just to be clear, the costs do you still feel like the cost reductions can obviously those margins aren’t going to be above the average, but you feel like you can get into acceptable range and ramp volumes in there by the fourth fiscal quarter, is that fair to say?
Mark Durcan: I’m not going to predict anything relative to ASPs or margins, but I do feel very confident that our 3D NAND ramp and our TLC ramp are as predicted with the associated cost gains that you expect and that we previously discussed.
Steven Fox: Great. It’s very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for taking my question. Mark, as you look into the second half, especially with the mix shift, the shifting more towards mobile and served DRAM, how should we think about the die penalty and increase DRAM bits that are coming from your migration to 20-nanometer? You do get a better cost decline, but the results show a mix shift that carries a die penalty. And I’m just trying to better understand those dynamics? And I’ve a follow-up.
Mark Durcan: Yes. So, you’re correct that some of these new IOs have die size penalty associated with them. It’s a mix of anywhere between 0 and 8, 9, 10 percentage, depending on the density and the form factor. I’d say that the mix shift that we see is, yes, we will continue to see as we move through the year. Some increase in the growth in the mix relative to these mobile IDs. Generally speaking, we’re also going to see growth in the server segment as well. So, generally speaking we’ve given you this all-in bit growth guidance of 15% to 25% CAGR over the next couple of years. And that includes the mix effects that we currently anticipate in our business and I think we’re fairly confident in terms of our ability to understand.
Mehdi Hosseini: Sure. And then one question for Ernie, as you go to this inventory adjustments, is there any color you can provide on how we should think about the free cash flow? I know you don’t want to comment on margin, but your working capital requirement is going up. Should we assume that cash burn is going to decrease or increase from the just reported quarter or any other color that you can provide?
Ernie Maddock: You know if you look at the guidance we’ve provided for FQ2 and what we’ve provided for FQ3; they’re not too dissimilar to one another. And if you look at the CapEx discussion we just had where we’re saying we’re still on track to spend about $5 billion and clearly we’ve reported on the first half of the year in terms of CapEx spend. I think you’ve all the information you need to understand within a reasonable estimable range what the cash flow environment will likely look like for the third fiscal quarter.
Mehdi Hosseini: But you just said that your inventories are going to go higher, I’m just -- would that imply that your operating cash is going to be less compared to the February quarter?
Ernie Maddock: No, because if you think about the reverse, let’s say they weren’t going higher, you would have expected those to sell-through into the revenue line, which would have effectively increase the cash flow vis-à-vis the prior quarter. So, the fact that we -- the guidance does really contemplate if you sort of follow the guide post I’ve just provided to you, they will get you to a pretty good estimate of what is likely to happen on cash flow for the quarter.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy of Stifel. Your line is open.
Kevin Cassidy: Thanks for taking my question. It seems the automotive market has some good growth and can you give us an idea of what content -- what DRAM content can be in the automobile over the years?
Mark Durcan: Probably not -- it varies greatly depending on model obviously. You would kind of think in terms of all-in memory growth and we think it can be up to $90, $100 a car.
Kevin Cassidy: Okay. And will this be above corporate average gross margin or where does it fit in on the gross margin curve?
Mark Durcan: Yes, the automotive business has been pretty strong for us. And its also we view it as an attractive business, because the sockets are pretty sticky, the life times of the products are longer and so from a total return its very positive market for us.
Kevin Cassidy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Rajvindra Gill of Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Rajvindra Gill: Yes, thanks for taking my questions. I’m just trying to get a better understanding of the gross margin guide. I’m trying to reconcile the fact that as we progress throughout the year, you should be getting higher yields on 20-nanometer and 20-nanometer should represent a higher percentage of the capacity, yet the margins are coming down 300 odd basis points. And so, if you could maybe help me reconcile that, the gross margin guide with relative to the cost reductions, improving as you go throughout the year that will be helpful.
Ernie Maddock: I think its very similar to the answer of one of the earlier questions, which is we’re very confident and provided some pretty clear visibility into what we think is happening with the cost structure. And as I said earlier, we all have an assumption set around what’s going to happen in the pricing environment and so depending on your assumption about that, and we certainly have taken a view that suggest that you’re going to continue to see some of the pressure that we’ve seen over the recent quarters. So the gross margin guide is very, very centered around an ASP assumption versus any doubt about our ability to achieve our cost reductions.
Rajvindra Gill: So why would you -- in the second half, calendar second half, what makes you kind of optimistic that the pricing is going to or with the overall DRAM environment is going to get better and somehow lead to better DRAM pricing? And along those lines, can you talk a little bit about why is the pricing been so weak in the last several quarters and why would it somehow abate going forward, if that’s the case?
Ernie Maddock: You know I’m not sure I said that product would improve at all. So, I don’t think I went there. And as a result of that, I think I said we expect to see continued pricing pressure and certainly if you think about our discussion around our inventory build and that being in the mobile business and the mobile business typically being at the upper end of the gross margin continuum rather than the PC segment, it does help explain some of that thinking that went into our gross margin guide for the quarter.
Rajvindra Gill: And just last question, and what is the basis of the comment that you’re going to improve your competitive position as you move throughout the second half of ’16, as you just acknowledge that the pricing environment we don’t know what’s going to happen, it could get worse, it could get better. Why would your competitive positioning improve in the second half?
Mark Durcan: So there is always a mix piece to the equation that may vary from competitor to competitor, but if you set that aside, I think we’ve outlined that we think our bit growth and our cost downs, particularly in DRAM starting in Q3, and in NAND later in the quarter are going to be significant relative to what you would expect for an industry average and that’s really what drives the fundamental equation relative to relative competitive position irrespective of what market conditions might look like.
Rajvindra Gill: All right. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your question please.
Farhan Ahmad: Hi. This is Farhan Ahmad asking the question on behalf of John. Thanks for taking the question. My first question is regarding the cost reductions that you just reported for DRAM and NAND. It seems like the NAND cost reductions were pretty significant that came in at 12% quarter-on-quarter whereas DRAM was somewhat less than what I’d have thought like the cost per bit actually went off. Can you talk about what drove the bit cost reduction in NAND? And also on DRAM, like why are we not seeing any benefit from the 20-nanometer transition yet?
Mark Durcan: Well, we had significant bits -- bit growth in NAND in the quarter and typically we expect the cost reduction associated with that. On the DRAM side, what we did I think experience a measurable success relative to the progress we made on our 20-nanometer and the placement of those products with customers. There is a mix impact that is somewhat of a headwind related to the type of memory and in particular LPDDR4 and DDR4 versus LPDDR3 and DDR3. That is a headwind relative to bit growth. We will overwhelm that as we move through the next couple of quarters as we’ve talked about. But that has been a little bit of a headwind and when you layer on top of that some of the inventory growth in high margin products or with a higher margin products typically the mobile piece of the business, that was somewhat of a headwind relative to the cost reduction of DRAM in the current quarter.
Farhan Ahmad: Got it. And then one question is related to your inventories, like you’re holding little bit longer inventory and given that the mix is such a big factor in -- like on the mobile side, it seems like it’s very specific to the products that you’re designed in. Should we assume like most of the inventory that you’re holding mostly is going to be in the PC or can you hold inventory in other segments of the market as well?
Mark Durcan: No, in particular inventory that we’re holding is primarily been around timing of product qualifications, and while there is a mix of different types of products in that inventory, I wouldn’t direct you to the compute market, in particular, in fact I’d say that mobile is more significant piece of that.
Farhan Ahmad: Thank you. That’s all I have.
Mark Durcan: Let me just -- additionally its -- we’re not taking what we think is any significant risk here. These are products that we’ve high confidence we’re going to sell-through are pretty fungible among customers.
Farhan Ahmad: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Arcuri of Cowen and Company. Your line is open.
Timothy Arcuri: Hi. Thanks a lot. I had a question on gross margin as well, but I guess I’m just -- I want to make sure that I’ve the right message from what you’re saying. It sounds like that you’re saying that look from the gross margin guidance that it would appear that maybe you’re not getting the cost downs, but in fact you’re. Its just pricing, it’s basically overwhelming the cost downs in the make orders. That is the message?
Mark Durcan: We’re not going to forecast the make order pricing for you. We -- no matter how many times you -- how different ways we go at it, Tim, unfortunately we can’t tell you that, but we can tell you we’re pretty comfortable with our cost downs and our bit growth, being along the lines of what we previously forecast to you and we’re very comfortable with the way everything is progressing in manufacturing. So you got to take that last little piece and plug it in yourself.
Ernie Maddock: Yes, and I’d add to that, Tim, that its important to remember that we’ve always sort of looked at NAND cost reduction as more of a Q4 event with DRAM in Q3 and if you again couple that with the color we’ve provided around inventory and that being predominantly attributable to one of the higher margin segments, I think you will find that if you triangulate around all of this, its pretty easy to understand that what we’re saying around cost reduction is in fact reality.
Timothy Arcuri: Got it. Thank, Ernie. And then, I just have one more, so can you talk about Inotera, May is the first full quarter of the new agreement. Of course you’re in the process of buying them, but the market dynamics have changed a lot since you last talked about the impact. So, can you maybe help us a little bit about handicapping what the impact of the change in the agreement is on the make order guidance?
Mark Durcan: Sure. So, obviously with the change in the market since the time we talked about the acquisition, the benefits whether you assume its the new arrangements or the full consolidation are actually more muted. We still believe that they’re positive, but significantly more muted than the time when we originally announced things and we’d expect from a handicapping point of view FQ1 would be the first time you would see the big uplift and the impacts that we’ve previous talked about relative to margin accretion starting in the third quarter have obviously changed as a result of the change in the market environment.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And next question comes from C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI. Your question please.
Ada Menaker: Hi. This is Ada calling in for C.J. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the timing of the 1X nano ramp and also the required CapEx there?
Mark Durcan: Yes, not a whole lot to communicate on that yet, other than we’ve started early silicon in the fab in Taichung. And this it’s a process that we don’t believe will result in any significant volume on 110 -- when we call a 110 series or 1X nanometer node until we get into 2017.
Ada Menaker: Thank you. And in terms of the financing for the Inotera acquisition, any updates there?
Mark Durcan: You know that’s moving along as we expected. So there is no new news from the last time we shared things publicly.
Ada Menaker: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Joseph Moore: Great. Thank you. I wanted to clarify one thing on the slide, it says the capital expenditures is 5.3% to 5.8% net of the partner contribution, is it still $5 billion net of partner contribution, is that right?
Ernie Maddock: Yes, it is still $5 billion net of partner contribution.
Joseph Moore: Okay, great. And then with the mobile issue, is that something that you were able to anticipate -- did you know that three months ago, when you talk about the quarter, when you plan the fab or did that surprise you over the course of the quarter and what happened for kind of like-for-like pricing in the mobile space, outside of that issue.
Mark Durcan: We ended up in a slightly different place relative to what we saw through relative to mobile, that is fair to say. Relative to mobile pricing, down mid single digits in the quarter we finish.
Joseph Moore: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho. Your line is open.
Vijay Rakesh: Yes, hi guys. Just looking at the make order, the softness in the gross margin side, when you -- as you ramp your 20-nanometer LPDDR4 once it gets qualified, let’s say, and 3D NAND, do you expect the margins to improve once they start shipping. Obviously, most of it is [indiscernible] inventory now. Can you get us some color there?
Mark Durcan: You know we continue to focus around our cost and our cost competitiveness. We really don’t get in the business of forecasting margins, because there is a pricing environment piece of that which we’ve very little control over. So, we can talk clearly about what we think is going to happen on the cost front, we’ve done that. I’m happy to reiterate that. But margin is not something we’re in the business of doing.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. And on the 3D NAND side, I guess just looking at 3D NAND and LPDDR4, what do you expect the mix -- what does that mix here and where do you see the mix, let’s say by exiting calendar of ’16?
Mark Durcan: While we talk about being in -- being over 50% 3D NAND in the fall, and so if you want more precision than that, probably not ready to go there yet, other than to say we continue to be very happy with the way that technology is rolling out in manufacturing. We are very satisfied with the quality and the -- and our ability to apply TLC versions of our 3D NAND. And that will provide an added boost really later in the fall and into the beginning of 2017.
Vijay Rakesh: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Li of Robert Baird. Your line is open.
Justin Li: Thanks for taking the question. This is Justin calling on behalf of Tristan Gerra. My first question would be, could you share your view on that recent memory investment from China?
Mark Durcan: Well, its -- I don’t think I’ve got anything really new to say about that. I think we’ve said before that we anticipated that clearly China was interested in being the memory market and that they would look for ways to find partners or to grow organically. We’ve now heard about significant investments in organic growth. But we would remind everyone a yes, that we believe that there are significant technology hurdles and intellectual property requirements in terms of being a major player in the memory space and we think its going to be a challenging road for the -- for organic and will take sometime.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thanks. The next question is regarding the 3D cross point that you will start to sell next year, which customers are you going to sell to and how much cannibalization do you think it will bring to DRAM and NAND?
Mark Durcan: Yes, its what -- first of all, you’re right. This year we’re short of an enablement mode, and we’re working with a number of different end market segments. Some customers then have significant interest in mobile, some customers in enterprise, or big data applications, I mean mobile for low power -- from the low power benefits. Early on as we ramp this technology we expect cannibalization to be low to zero. Over time, as the technology matures and drive to significantly higher volumes. I’d expect some of that volume to come out of what otherwise would have been DRAM and maybe even eventually what otherwise have been other types of Non-Volatile memory. But generally speaking, this is a differentiated technology that will grow the size of the overall memory market at least over the next two, three, four years.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Jagadish Iyer of Redstone. Your line is open.
Jagadish Iyer: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions, Mark. First on the, you heard on the DRAM side, the bit growth was substantially less in the last quarter. And you did say that in the fiscal third quarter you’re going to have significant chunk of it. What gives you the confidence that you’re going to be ramping successfully on that, given that the historically you’ve had some challenges on that. Can you just elaborate your conviction level on what kind of step up on the big growth are we going to see in the second half between calendar third quarter and fourth quarter and then into 2017?
Mark Durcan: Yes, so we don’t give you bit growth projection for either production or sales anymore, since we are down guiding all the financial numbers. But I think the broader interpretation of your question is what are we confident, we’re going to have the bit growth that we’re baking into our models and the answer there is we’re now a month of the quarter, so a significant part of the output is already out and another significant part of the output is already running in the fab. We are seeing a month of yield data already. And we just reinforce what we said in the last Analyst Day presentation that the ramp is really at that time was and continues to outperform any previous new technology ramp in terms of yield maturity. And so, we just really like the way its going. We are seeing strong progress in two fabs in parallel and we’re highly confident that we’re going to deliver on the bit growth and associated cost improvements that we forecast to you previously.
Jagadish Iyer: Okay. Just on the cost reduction, how should we be thinking about in terms of is it going to be -- how, is there a cost reduction go for 20-nanometer going to be different from the cost reduction, the 25-nanometer, can you just elaborate on that or is it going to be similar?
Mark Durcan: Well, what we’ve said is that over a -- the CAGR that we provided which is 16 and 17 that we’re looking at somewhere in the realm of 25% cost down versus 20-nanometer, that’s more of a cash cost down and that if you take total costs, all then including depreciation which we will encounter to a higher degree of 20-nanometer versus what we encountered at 25. We are looking at somewhere between 15% and 25%, so it will obviously in the early days it will be less, but as we get and ramp to mature yield, you will expect to see some right in the center of that range.
Jagadish Iyer: Okay. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chin of UBS. Your line is open.
Steven Chin: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a couple on NAND flash, if I could. First, I just wanted to review a quick the cost reduction strategy for assisting products, in particular, as their coal mentioned of TLC. I just want to make sure is that TLC 2D NAND or were you referring to a 2D planer TLC as well as part of the lower cost NAND that’s going to go into SSD right this year?
Mark Durcan: So, we’ve planer, TLC NAND in the marketplace today. But we -- I think we commented earlier that, the SSD, the client SSD and consumer SSD market has been fairly challenged from a pricing perspective and so we’ve been measured in terms of how we approach that end market? I think the more important thing is that yes, we believe that as we move to 3D NAND and very significant percentage of our output will eventually become 3D and that’s just drive significant cost reduction above and beyond the conversion to 3D itself.
Steven Chin: Okay. Thanks, Mark. And I just -- as my follow up for the Gen2 3D NAND process that you mentioned will be going into, I guess, going through the fabs a little bit later this summer, Can you comment on whether the tool set for this Gen2 will be identical to the Gen 1, that you’re already outfitting in your fabs or will it requires some incremental spending on top of that? Thanks.
Mark Durcan: So, we actually already have Gen 2 in a manufacturing fab. What I commented on was that we’d start sort of early production in the summer. So, we’ve -- we actually have product range from manufacturing fabs today on Gen 2, and obviously like the way that’s going as well. As to the equipment set, its not identical, but it is similar equipment. In some cases more of it, that are very, very similar tools.
Steven Chin: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Romit Shah of Nomura. Your question please.
Romit Shah: Yes, thanks. Just back to inventories, it just seems from my perspective that less demand gets a lot better. Pricing is going to continue to be weak until Micron and the DRAM industry overall cuts production. So, I guess, my question is, what will it take for that to happen?
Romit Shah: We don’t have any plans that cut production to date.
Mark Durcan: Mark, you said in …
Romit Shah: You can see if others divide enough.
Romit Shah: I mean, is your point that its got to come from the market share leader first?
Mark Durcan: Well, I think -- well, first of all, we’re not going to do it unless we see negative cash margins, because we haven’t added any incremental capacity. And we think we’d be foolish to be the first ones to take capacity off, given that fact set.
Ernie Maddock: Yes its point to remember how much of our cost structure is fixed. And so to Mark’s point as long as we’re getting a contribution to that cost structure, that fixed cost structure, it’s a really ill advised move to be unilaterally cutting production.
Romit Shah: So the other thing I think, just the sort of temporarily the assumption in your question. DRAM CapEx is going to be down about 30% this year. So I don’t think its necessary all doom and gloom as we look at -- what we think supply growth is going to be going forward and what we think demand growth is, segment by segment. We kind of already gave you our opinion, which is its going to take a little bit of time, but we think that this is going to be a healthy environment again.
Romit Shah: I guess, the prevailing view a year-ago was that all the players in the DRAM industry were focused on maximizing profit, but today the focus seems to be on market share and Mark, maybe you could just give us your perspective on what you think happening in terms of this competitive dynamics.
Mark Durcan: Our focus isn’t on market share. Our focus is on making sure that we’ve deployed equivalent advanced technology, at least equivalent advanced technology to our competitor, so that we’re not incentivising others to play for market share. And we think that’s just really a prudent thing to do as managers of our business that we should make sure that we’re putting in place efficient manufacturing production capacity and that’s what we’re very, very focused on.
Romit Shah: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Ing of MKM Partners. Your question please.
Ian Ing: Yes, thank you. So, in your prepared comments you talked about early signs of a demand recovery in China. Could you talk more about that? I’m assuming it excludes mobile, given some of the qualification issues?
Mark Durcan: You know that comment was really a specific to the networking segment of our CNBU business. And we start -- we’re starting to see a little bit more activity there, maybe early parts of next generation infrastructure rollout. And we’d expect that to continue for a number of years.
Ian Ing: Okay. So, largely networking then. Okay, my follow-up is expectations for DRAM bit growth in fiscal ’17 under 20%, I mean has that thinking changed since the Analyst Day, because you did provide that two year CAGR 20% to 30% over two years. I mean, do we go to the low end of the range or could you go under that?
Mark Durcan: No, we still think that the range that we provided is accurate over that timeframe. The industry we think will be less than 20% in terms of industry bit growth.
Ian Ing: Thanks for the clarification. So, you’re implying you could outgrow in fiscal ’17, outgrow the industry?
Mark Durcan: Yes, that’s as a result of deploying advanced technology, not adding wafers for, are targeting some specific market.
Ian Ing: Okay. Thank you.
Mark Durcan: And operator, I think we’ve got one more question, then we will be done.
Operator: Yes sir. And the question comes from the line of Nilay Mehta of KLS. Your line is open.
Nilay Mehta: Hey guys. I’ve some question, a few from me, first sort of on the end market. It seems like PCs were pretty weak in the first quarter, just seems all the data points since that came through your numbers. Just want to see what you guys are thinking going forward what you guys have seen from your customers on the PC side and also on the mobile side, it sounds like you guys have some inventory builds. I just want to get a little bit color on sort of what cause that inventory build and how you guys see that playing out? And then my last question is on the Inotera financing. You say there is no updates, but given where the stock is right now, would you contemplate doing the equity portion in that given again where your stock price is now in the amount of shares you guys have, would have to issue to finance that 1 million RPs[ph]? Thanks.
Mark Durcan: So I will take the first two and I will let Ernie to come back to the Inotera financing. Relative to PCs, yes, it continues to be weak. We think maybe down mid single-digits for the year, DRAM content maybe up about 10% for the year. We’re not expecting any big things out of PC demand when we give you our view as the demand growth for the year across all the various segments. But once you get outside of PCs, growing obviously slower than overall market supply for DRAM, and mobile growing maybe right around the market supply for DRAM. You got all these other segments that we think will out script supply growth servers, automotive, etcetera, etcetera. So, generally speaking we do believe that in aggregate things are going to take care of themselves. Relative to mobile inventory, again its primarily -- there is a mix of things in inventory, but we did indicate that a chunk of it is mobile and a lot of that just revolves around timing of product qualifications that we’ve, a high confidence in, we’re just building inventory in advance of those qualifications and so that we’re prepared to ship that product out when the qualifications come through. And Ernie, you want to take Inotera?
Ernie Maddock: Sure. So, again similar to what we said before, we’re looking at a wide variety of options for that remaining $1 billion and as the time to close approaches, we will be looking at the alternatives that make the most sense to us, given where we’re at the time.
Mark Durcan: All right. I want to thank everyone for their participation on the call today and for their continued interest in Micron. Obviously, I’m still bullish of the memory industry. I like the way we’re executing and with that I’m going to turn it back over to Ivan to close us up.
Ivan Donaldson: Thanks, Mark. If you just bear with me, I’ve to reread then Safe Harbor language real quickly. I need to -- let's see.

Mark Durcan: Thank you, Ivan. For fiscal Q1 2016, Micron posted total revenue of $3.35 billion with gross margins of 25%, non-GAAP net income of $249 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.24, all within our guided range. In addition, our non-GAAP operating income was 246 million and our operating cash flow was $1.1 billion. Our results were primarily impacted by continued weakness in the PC DRAM segment. In addition, pricing pressure was also present in the client SSD and certain eMCP segments. As for Micron's execution, we are on-track with the qualification of several new technologies, including 20-nanometer DDR4 and low-power DDR4, as well as our 3D NAND products. These products and technology transitions can be disruptive to the manufacturing environment in the short-term, but we believe they will pay dividends going forward as our product portfolio will be better positioned to address market demand. While current market conditions and our financial results have been challenging, we remain confident and we're focused on deploying our advanced technology in order to drive enhanced operational leverage for the Company. Taken together expected market conditions and new product qualifications will continue to create challenges in the near-term. However, we still expect to see stronger bit growth and cost reductions commencing in the second half of fiscal 2016. These advancements in our technology deployment, as well as our new system level solution products we're developing and deploying will improve our long-term competitive position and drive enhanced financial results. Reflecting on market conditions, we believe that DRAM industry bit supply growth will be in a low 20% range in 2016, in line with demand and that industry fundamentals will remain healthy over the long-term. Demand continues to diversify driven by the mobile cloud server and embedded segments, which together balance maturing PC demand. The DRAM industry consist of only three technology developers, based on current long-term outlook we foresee technology driven supply growth slowing and can envision a future in which no additional DRAM wafer capacity is required. Turning to the NAND market, as I noted earlier, we've seen price competition in client SSDs and eMCPs during our first fiscal quarter. While we expect some of these trends to continue into fiscal Q2, we've also seen some positive signs in other segments and will continue to monitor market conditions carefully. Industry-wide, we see relatively muted NAND supply growth in 2016 as planar fabs are converted to 3D, creating short-term headwinds to supply. We estimate industry bit supply growth in the mid-30% range, which is likely below the long-term demand trend. As the cost advantage of large scale 3D NAND deployment is realized, we expect solid-state drives will see accelerated adoption in the client, datacenter and enterprise segments. This adoption combined with higher densities, should form the basis of a healthy long-term demand environment. These trends will likely be complemented by density growth in mobile devices. Beyond 2016, we believe that the longer term NAND demand trend should lead to additional industry capacity, including our own Fab 10X expansion in Singapore. Construction for this facility is on-track and we currently expect to ramp into it starting in the second half of calendar 2016. Our capacity ramp will be driven by market conditions and expected ROIC. Micron has focused on the deployment of advanced technology to drive manufacturing efficiency and enable innovative new products. Specifically in 2016, this focus is on three key areas, ramping 20-nanometer DRAM and enabling 1X DRAM in manufacturing, ramping 3D NAND and enabling second generation 3D NAND in manufacturing, and finally accelerating the development of advanced controllers to enable growth in SSDs and other system-level solutions. In terms of bit growth, for DRAM, we still expect Micron to be above the market for calendar year 2016, based on a market growth assumption in the low-20% range. The majority of Micron's growth will occur in the latter half of fiscal 2016, with continued progress in fiscal year 2017. For trade NAND, we expect our bit growth to be below the market in calendar 2016, as we proceed with 3D conversions which will limit output in the first half of the year. Our Fab 10X expansion and 3D conversions position us to significantly outgrow the NAND market in fiscal 2017. Turning to Inotera, as you heard us announce last week, we entered into agreements for Micron to acquire the remaining outstanding equity of Inotera. We believe this a compelling combination for the companies, our shareholders, our customers and our employees. Micron has a solid history of integrating memory assets and we believe this acquisition will prove to be successful. Separately, we've also entered into an agreement granting Nanya an option to license to future DRAM technology nodes in exchange for a royalty and equity arrangement. These agreements form the basis for a continuous strategic partnership with Nanya and the Formosa Group. I'll turn the call over to Mark Adams now, who will summarize our operational and business unit results. Ernie Maddock will then cover Q1 financials and I'll conclude with a couple of thoughts prior to Q&A. Mark?
Mark Adams: Thank you, Mark. I will begin by reviewing our DRAM and Non-Volatile businesses, followed by an update on each of our four business units. And close with commentary on our operations and technology deployment activities. Let's begin with DRAM, which represented 58% of our total revenue in fiscal Q1. While PC DRAM average selling prices remained under pressure, we saw more stable pricing in our other market segments, where demand remained relatively healthy. We continue to ramp 20-nanometer DRAM technology and move production to DDR4 and LPDDR4 to meet customer demand. As a percentage of DRAM revenue in fiscal Q1, mobile was in a low-30% range similar to Q4. The PC segment was in the mid-20% range, up slightly from prior quarter. The server business was in the high-teens percent range from the low-20% last quarter. And especially, DRAM which includes networking, graphics, automotive and other embedded technologies was in the low-20%, similar to last quarter. In our Non-Volatile Memory business, trade revenue represents 34% of total revenue in fiscal Q1. Performance was consistent with our expectations making early progress on our 3D RAM and customer qualifications. As a percentage of trade, Non-Volatile Memory revenue in fiscal Q1, consumer which includes our memory cards, USB and components was approximately 50% up from mid-40s in Q4. Mobile including MCPs was in the high-teens percent range from low-20s last quarter. SSDs were in the mid-teens percent range similar to last quarter and Automotive and Industrial Multimarket segment or AIM and other embedded applications were in the mid-teens percent range similar to Q4. Moving on to our business units, Micron's Compute and Networking business unit posted fiscal Q1 revenue of $1.14 billion down 12% from the prior quarter with non-GAAP operating income of $21 million or 2% of revenue. CMBU was impacted by lower average selling prices driven by continued softness in demand from the PC segment. While we anticipate this demand to remain relatively soft in Q2, we're encouraged by growth opportunities in other areas of the market, including enterprise and cloud segments and remain focused on optimizing our product mix in fast growing high-value segments. On the technology front, we successfully executed go-to-market activity on our 20-nanometer DDR3, our GDDR5 and 8 gigabyte DDR4 products. Our Enterprise and Cloud segment saw strong growth for our DDR4 products driven by increased cloud demand from several of our hyper-scale customers. We're making good progress deploying our 20-nanometer 8 gigabyte components which will drive future cost improvements. Looking forward, we anticipate year-over-year bit growth of 40-plus percent driven by increased memory requirements to support virtualization and real-time analytic workloads. Our DDR4 portfolio and innovative Non-Volatile DIMM products have us well-positioned to benefit from these strong growth trends in the future. The graphic card segment experienced softness in demand as customers rebalanced inventory levels of GDDR5 early in the quarter. We anticipate demand to increase returning to normal levels within the current quarter. We continue to successfully ramp our 20-nanometer 8 gigabyte GDDR5 with a substantial increase in shipments during fiscal Q1 and we are well-positioned to capitalize on growth in system DRAM content in the future. The Networking segment was impacted by seasonal weakness in demand and the delay of China LTE build-out. However, market feedback suggests that demand should regain momentum in the coming months. In Q1, we doubled DDR4 shipments quarter-over-quarter in our networking segment. In the Client PC segment, we shipped our first 8 gigabyte DDR4 samples to major OEM customers and are well-positioned for mass production later this quarter. Looking forward as PC form factors continue to evolve, Micron's broad offering in DDR3, DDR4, and low-power DRAM will enable us to meet the changing needs of this market and deliver greater value. Micron Stores Business Unit posted fiscal Q1 revenue of $884 million, up 4% versus the prior quarter with a non-GAAP operating loss of $27 million or negative 3%. We maintain relatively stable average selling prices in our Stores business for the fourth consecutive quarter. SBU continues to focus on optimizing our product portfolio to mitigate transactional market exposure, while serving higher value segments. Our 3D vertical NAND technology has three times the density of existing planner solutions. We are actively sampling and developing our own SSD product portfolio based upon through an 384 gigabyte 3D TLC and 256 gigabyte 3D MLC NAND, and expect to make products available for broad marketplace adoption in the second half of fiscal year 2016. In the Components segment, we delivered our first 3D NAND dye to the market in Q1, shipping 256 gigabyte MLC 3D NAND components to nearly 20 third-party USB and consumer SSD manufacturers. Shipments to additional customers are continuing this quarter. Client and Consumer SSDs bit growth increased by double-digits sequentially as decreasing SSD prices continues to accelerate adoption in OEM Ultrabook and Ultrathin PCs, as well as consumer upgrades. Lower density consumer SSD will continue to narrow the cost gigabyte parity gap with hard drives, increasing their attractiveness. Our Enterprise business saw quarter-over-quarter demand growth with strong OEM component sales growing 47% sequentially. Enterprise SSD revenue was up 13% sequentially driven by market pull for enterprise server, cloud storage and flash array solutions. We began sampling our new S600 Series of SaaS-based SSDs in fiscal Q1, having qualified these drives with OEM customers and engaging in qualifications with numerous end-users and channel integrators. This SSD series is the first product family developed as part of Micron's strategic agreement with Seagate combining flash innovation and SaaS expertise from both companies. These drives are scheduled to begin shipping commercially in the first half of the fiscal year. Datacenter SSD bit shipments were down quarter-over-quarter amid competitive price pressure. Despite the market competitiveness in enhances datacenter SSD segment, we received orders for M500 DC and M510 SATA-based SSDs from multiple hyper-scaling customers and cloud customers, and continue to ramp these encryption enhanced SSDs with end-users who require enterprise-level data encryption in end-markets such as medical, banking and government. Micron's mobile unit posted fiscal Q1 revenue of 834 million down 13% versus the prior quarter, due to lower volumes and pricing pressure from the eMCP market. Non-GAAP operating income was 136 million or 16% down from Q4 reflecting the higher cost of 20-nanometer product during the early ramp. Micron’s Mobile business unit continues to benefit from the evolving mobile systems architectures that steadily increase memory density requirements at all private levels. Demand in the quarter moved toward the high-end and value segments, both of which continued to show rapid growth in memory content. We started to see seasonally soft demand in line with our expectations towards the end of the quarter, which we expect to continue through fiscal Q2. Bit shipments of eMCP were down 14% driven by relative softness in the mid-range handset market in China. We are encouraged by strengthening sign in the higher value markets. Demand remains strong for discreet on package low power DDR4 and higher density eMCPs. We will be completing a number of LP4 20-nanometer Tier 1 OEM qualification this quarter and expect LP4 volume to surpass LP3 by fiscal Q3. The Embedded business unit posted fiscal Q1 revenues of 479 million, slightly up from the previous quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin increased to 24%, which is a 2% improvement from the previous quarter, driven by better overall cost and growth in the Automotive segment. Automotive revenue increased 5% quarter-over-quarter and 12% year-over-year. These results were driven by solid growth in DRAM and eMMC in applications that include Infotainment, Instrument Cluster and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. We recently announced our XTRMFlash a new NOR flash solution with an auto sequential interface that boats industry-leading reading throughputs with ultra fabs and random access times. We also continue to make good progress in next-generation design wins with key automotive customers in Europe and in Asia. Following a strong fiscal Q4 2015, our Industrial and Multimarket business declined primarily due to reductions in NOR volumes. We lost our first SSTD M500IT targeted for industrial customers in the quarter and we are making positive strides with DDR4 validations and low-power DRAM design wins. Our Consumer and Connected Home revenue increased 10% quarter-over-quarter with significant increases in unit volume demand for DRAM partially offset by pricing declines. We anticipate continued share increases in DRAM. Our MCPs, NOR, EMLC, SPI NAND and high-endurance eMMCs provide a strong baseline portfolio, in addition to DRAM and low-power DRAM products in the Consumer and Connected Home market. Key trends include the growth of wearables, cloud-based DDR and instant on applications, including graphical man-to-man interfaces and multifunction printers and home automation products. I would like to close with a few updates on our operations and technology deployment activities. As is evidenced from my comment about prior design wins and qualifications, Micron remains on-track to our conversion plan and yield targets for both the 20-nanometer DRAM and 3D NAND technologies. We continue to expect, 20-nanometer to represent more than half of our DRAM output in the May quarter. And 3D NAND is on-track to be a majority of our NAND output by the end of the calendar 2016. Our 1X DRAM and GEN 2 3D NAND technologies are also progressing well in R&D and we are focused on transferring the technology to production fabs before the end of fiscal 2016 for the production ramp beginning in fiscal 2017. We are also very excited about the opportunity to simplify our operations and business model, as a result of the announced acquisition of Inotera. The fab will be 100% converted to our 20-nanometer technology by the time we expect to close the deal in mid-2016, hoping to drive significant cost reductions for Micron thereafter. In addition, we will increase our flexibility to drive capital investment decisions, as well as product and technology mix going forward. Now to continue our commentary on Q1 results and Q2 guidance, I will turn the call over to Ernie.
Ernie Maddock: Thanks Mark. Consistent with the direction that we shared last quarter commentary around the P&L will focus on our non-GAAP results. Please refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation slides posted on our Web site. As Mark Durcan noted earlier, revenue for the first quarter was $3.35 billion coming in at the low-end of our guided range. Overall, our revenues were impacted by declining pricing particularly in the PC DRAM segment, partially offset by volume increases in both the DRAM and Non-Volatile Trade segments. Gross margin ended the quarter at 25.3%, consistent with our guidance and non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $249 million or $0.24 per share, slightly above the midpoint of our guided range. During the quarter, we benefited from a better than anticipated tax provision, as well as favorable results from our equity method investments offset by lower than expected operating income. As a reminder, Micron includes both amortization of acquisition intangibles and stock compensation expense in our non-GAAP reporting. Taken together these two items represent an additional $0.04 per share for the recently completed quarter. Now let's look at the results by product line. DRAM revenue decreased approximately 10% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of lower average selling prices. During the quarter, we saw further market adoption of DDR4 DRAM products, in both mobile and non-mobile segments. DRAM gross margin was in the upper-20% range, lower than our previous quarter as a result of decreases in average selling prices that outpaced decreases in per bit costs. Our Non-Volatile Trade revenue decreased slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, due to decreased average selling price that outpaced increases in sales volume. Gross margin remained relatively flat in the low-20% range as decreases in per bit cost to offset selling price changes. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter came in at approximately 600 million in line with the midpoint of our guided range. The Company generated operating cash flow of approximately 1.1 billion during the first quarter and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable investments of approximately $5.4 billion. Expenditures for PP&E in the first quarter were $1 billion and we continue to expect fiscal 2016 capital expenditures in the $5.3 billion to $5.8 billion range with expected third-party contributions of between $300 million and $800 million. During the quarter, we repurchased 57 million in face value of convertible notes for $94 million and approximately 7 million shares of our common stock for 126 million. Moving now to our second fiscal quarter guidance on a non-GAAP basis we expect the following. Consolidated revenue in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.2 billion, gross margin in the range of 17.5% to 20%, operating expenses between $565 million and $620 million, operating income ranging between a loss of $20 million and a income of 20 million, I'm sorry, operating income ranging between a loss of $60 million and income of $20 million and an EPS range between a loss of $0.12 per share and a loss of $0.05 per share based on 1.30 billion diluted shares. As we've discussed on the call we intend to acquire the remaining interest in Inotera not owned by Micron. This transaction will result in the full consolidation of Inotera into Micron's financial statements after closing of the acquisition, which is expected to occur mid-calendar year 2016. I'd like to spend a few moments reviewing key aspects of this important transaction. First, we expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive at closing. Second, and equally important we expect to generate significant incremental operating cash flow. As a point of reference, under the margin sharing structure which commences at the beginning of calendar 2016, we would expect to realize approximately 25% of the total operating cash flow associated with the output from Inotera. After closing, we will receive the full benefit of this cash flow. Over the last 12 months this would have generated an approximate $1.4 billion of incremental operating cash flow for the Company. Finally, we expect future cash flows from the Inotera output to be well above the capital expenditures required to fund their technology advancements. Based on current market conditions Inotera's operations should on average generate north of $600 million of incremental free cash flow for a year for Micron. Micron plans to fund the acquisition of the remaining Inotera interest with approximately $2.5 billion of debt sourced in Taiwan at an expected interest rate of around 3%. In addition, we have the option to finance up to $1 billion worth with Micron stock sold to Nanya and we will fund the remaining $500 million with cash from our balance sheet. Separately, we've entered into agreements granting Nanya an option to licensee two future DRAM technology nodes continuing our strategic relationship. These license agreements may generate a future royalty stream for Micron in addition to a smaller equity ownership in Nanya with timing dependent on the technology deployment. At the earliest, we would expect these benefits to commence in calendar 2017. The license is non-transferrable, limited to a specific capacity footprint and terminates on change of control of Nanya. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Mark Durcan.
Mark Durcan: Thank you, Ernie. As many of you know Kipp Bedard will be transferring out of the Investor Relations leadership role over the next few weeks. So, I wanted to take just a minute today to thank him for all his contributions to the team over the last 32 years. Kipp has not only been a great leader of Investor Relations for Micron, but a selfless team member, whose contributions internally through the years rivaled his well-recognized excellence externally. I've always been able to count on Kipp, Kipp's honesty and thoughtful input on all manner of issues facing the Company, and in good times and bad he is and always has been all about Micron and the team. I think it's fair to say that Micron would not be the Company it used to be without Kipp. So, we will truly miss our good friend.
Kipp Bedard: Mark thank you very much for the kind words. It's been my honor and privilege to represent you and the entire Micron team into the public markets over the past three decades. For that opportunity and experience I am truly grateful. Thank you all for a very exciting and fulfilling career.
Mark Durcan: Thank you, Kipp. Let me finish on this topic by saying, we're very fortunate to have a very capable Ivan Donaldson in-house and ready to step into the lead IR role. I think most on the call already know Ivan and then he too has a thorough understanding of the Company, the industry along with the skills to excel in this role. I certainly expect that if he steps in, he will hit the ground running and thought Kipp is leaving behind some very big shoes to fill, Ivan's preparation and dedication, make him an easy choice for this role. To summarize our call today, we're in the midst of some challenging market conditions but we remain confident in the long-term health of the industry and in our strategy to succeed. This confidence drives our long-term investment perspective and we expect to see stronger bit growth and cost reductions starting in the second half of the year. Operationally, we're laser focused on execution related to the deployment of leading-edge DRAM and 3D NAND, as well as advanced controller development. Operator we're ready for Q&A.
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy from Stifel. Your question please.
Kevin Cassidy: Gross margins coming down again quarter-over-quarter even with -- you just point to transition to 20-nanometer and DDR4, I guess if you could help us with some of the moving parts on the gross margins for those products, the 20-nanometer, how much lower costs are you expecting as that becomes 100% of the Inotera output and also what is DDR4 versus DDR3 cost and gross margins?
Mark Durcan: So, first of all, I think it's important to recognize that, although Inotera's output will be, the wafer starts will be about 80% by year-end it takes a while to sort of move those through the overall system and deliver them into the marketplace and so you wouldn't get the full benefit of that 20-nanometer cost reduction as we move into our fiscal Q2. And in terms of other overall factors there was clearly continued pressure on PC DRAM and as we have talked about for some time, 20-nanometer doesn't get you to lower cost immediately whether from Inotera or out of any other fab as a result of startup costs and getting those ramps to scale. And then finally, DDR4 cost which is getting to be an increasingly important part of the mix are clearly a little bit higher than DDR3 and that creates some pressure as well. So those are the general characteristics of the margin trends there.
Kevin Cassidy: Okay. And just as a follow-up also on NAND flash, there was a conversion to TLC or can you say what percentage of your output was TLC versus MLC and is that expected to help gross margins going forward?
Mark Durcan: Our TLC output is about 10% plus or minus. We have more capabilities for upside volume if we so chose, that portion of the market has been super-competitive both in components and in TLC-based client center SSDs. So we've moved some of our capacity that we initially targeted TLC toward some higher value sockets, which really allowed us to insulate against pricing pressure although a bit better than the market.
Mark Adams: I think longer term it's fair to say that as we ramp 3D, we would expect that penetration to begin to increase again.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your question please.
Harlan Sur: Assuming another year of relatively muted demand trends in DRAM in 2016, does it make sense to accelerate your move to 1X DRAM technology to drive acceleration in your cost curve and I guess the same question on potentially accelerating the move to TLC and 3D NAND transitions within your NAND business because it just seems like the team is continuously fighting this uphill battle on the cost front?
Mark Durcan: Yes, you know we have said for some time that really it's absolutely imperative that we not necessarily have an identical technology profile to others in the market, but certainly narrow the gap relative to the deployed advanced technology, that enables a couple of things, one is it make sure that we have timely introduction of the right products for our customers. But additionally, it makes sure that we don't have a situation in the marketplace that competitors can take advantage of and drive increased market share due to a different profile relative to manufacturing efficiency. So, yes we think it's strategically important that we narrow this gap; we're focused on it and we believe that with demand growth that we see in the marketplace it can absorb that incremental capacity as we make those transitions, as long as others in the marketplace don't add too many incremental new wafers.
Harlan Sur: Okay, thanks for that. And then a better mix of enterprise and datacenter SSD I think would drive the nice offset to the price aggressiveness you're currently seeing on the client side, so if you could just give us an update on your enterprise SSD progress, you know you talked about rolling out your datacenter M500 Series, you also talked about rolling out your 600 Series with Seagate, how big is enterprise flash as a percent of your total NAND business? And can you just give us any view on that growth outlook for enterprise looking into the calendar year 2016?
Mark Durcan: Well, let me try to set the baseline from where we sit today. Enterprise is relatively small, but the growth trajectory is pretty big. The 3 areas of investment we’re driving today are continued focus on enterprise-level controller and firmware, obviously driving the Seagate product line to market in the SaaS category. And we're also investing very heavily in 3D NAND drives for enterprise which we will be sampling soon. The final piece for us is I mentioned briefly in my comments, our components that we market to other enterprise players are probably the highest margin products we have in NAND, because of the quality of NAND we manufacture. So when you combine all that out, we're pretty bullish about enterprise going forward and we will continue to invest as such.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg from Pacific Crest. Your question please.
Monika Garg: I just want to delve deeper into the margin guidance for next quarter, the gross margins are guided like 600 to 700 bps lower Q-over-Q, maybe could you walk on in details, is it mainly on the DRAM side of the margins are going lower or in the NAND side?
Mark Durcan: I would say it's more oriented on the DRAM side for all the reasons we've talked about on the course of the call. We expect NAND to be relatively similar to what we're seeing this quarter maybe a little bit sequentially lower, but it’s DRAM is where the most significant movement is.
Monika Garg: And then the DRAM is it mainly PC side or are you seeing that going -- now moving into mobile and server as well?
Mark Durcan: There is a continued performance and as you might imagine if you look at things that are closest to PCs that in the enterprise space maybe some of the cost basis that look a little bit more like PCs those maybe subject to some increasing price pressure as well. If you go to the mobile side which is a little bit more specialized that tends to be buffered somewhat, but generally speaking as we talked about on the call, you see pressure throughout that whole sector.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your question please.
John Pitzer: Ernie, I guess, from my perspective let's go back to the gross margin guidance for the February quarter, I think you did a good job, kind of talking about the puts and takes, do you think that the February quarter kind of represents the maximum quarter of pain on the cost side and has improved there and can you help me to understand as you look at 30-nanometer/25-nanometer DDR3 to 20-nanometer DDR4 at equivalent yield what's the cost down you would expect in that transition?
Ernie Maddock: Yes, so I do think from a cost perspective that we've been talking for sometime about the fact that the first couple of quarters of this fiscal year were going to be the most challenging for us as we got everything lined up relative to 20-nanometer and also on the NAND side. So I think that -- without certainly providing guidance beyond Q2, I would say our expectation is that with increased bits out we're going to see cost down that will be very helpful to us in the back half for the year. DDR4 has a bigger dye size than DDR3 but the shrink gets you closer to parity and also the production of 8 gig is also a big cost driver. So, it's really hard to say specifically but you are certainly in the same zip-code based on that comparison.
John Pitzer: That's helpful, guys, and then Mark, maybe as my follow-on relative to the implied guidance for February, it doesn't look like Inotera would be accretive on February numbers and maybe Ernie answered the question already, is the expectation by the time the Inotera acquisition closes that some of these cost headwinds will become tailwinds and hence this is an accretive acquisition or can you help me walk through kind of that dynamic?
Mark Durcan: Yes, I think, and maybe Ernie wants to comment on this too, John but, yes I think the key point is that as we get a little further into the year that 20-nanometer transition is driving some pretty significant improvements at Inotera and we expect it to be quite accretive to us right out of the chute once we close.
Ernie Maddock: Yes, and the only thing I'd add to that is that the bulk of the CapEx spend for their ’16 will already be completed. So, certainly from a cash flow perspective there is a lot of leverage there as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Amir from Ladenburg. Your question please.
Daniel Amir: A couple of questions here with regards to the eMCP and the client SSD, looks like those were areas of thereabout weakness here this quarter, can you give a bit more clarity kind of where we stand at this point in the quarter and specifically the eMCP given that bit shipments were down 14%, I mean in this scenario that you're going to still be focusing on as well? Thanks.
Mark Durcan: Sure, on the eMCP category, there's really two dynamics going on one of which is some market softness in mobile which we identified earlier in my comments. The second piece is that as is consist with some other DRAM segments, the 20-nanometer transition puts us in a position where this was heavy focused on qualifying at major OEM customers. Having said that, there is also one area of mix issues that relates to the high-end and the low-end doing better than the mid-range segment of the market, so combine all those three together and there is some pressure on eMCP demand, we are continuing to feel that as a place for our product's focus, but again weighing that against mix and other opportunities.
Daniel Amir: And the client SSD side?
Mark Durcan: That for us as I mentioned earlier, we saw a very heavy competition in client SSDs driven by low cost TLC products both in the consumer and OEM market and we chose to move some of our capacity out of that market to higher value sockets and that allowed us to get kind of the most out of our capacity.
Daniel Amir: And is that a trend that you are continuing this quarter as well?
Mark Durcan: I would say that without forecasting it is something that yes we see pretty consistent quarter to-date and we would as Mark commented we are going to watch that while we position our 3D NAND TLC out longer term, because of the performance and cost advantages there. But today we see other opportunities as I said for our NAND capacity more are high performing MLC capacity that allows us to make that shift.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox from Cross Research. Your question please.
Steven Fox: Thanks. Just a follow-up on those details, I was wondering if you could just sort of step back and if we look big picture around some of your comments about the PC market is a whole stabilizing. What gives you sort of confidence on that happening over next several months? And then similarly given some of the weakness you are seeing in the mid-range especially in China mobile market, again what do you think that improves as you get further into next calendar year? Thanks a lot.
Mark Durcan: Well, I not sure we sent forecast out on either one of those stated. We think that the PC market, the signs are that channel inventories are leveling off a little bit better that was after the inventory was low. If you look at more specifically to our business DRAM inventory in the channel with the exception of one player, one larger player, DRAM inventory across our channel is pretty low. So the demand seems to be flowing through and replenish of inventory seems -- that seems to be dynamic in the PC space. So that’s what behind our view of the world in terms of PC shipments. If you look at the data while not stellar growth certainly better than the first half of calendar year '15. On the mobile side, we still believe that these same dynamic goes on with smartphones, inventory is relatively low and the other side if you look at the configurations that are coming out for holiday and beyond, the memory content per unit is going out nicely in our favor. So it's all about for the mobile phone place market segment it's really all about what's the weighted average content and we still see not withstanding some of the weakness in the middle -- pretty reasonable growth in aggregate for the smartphone business.
Steven Fox: Great that’s very helpful. And then just a quick follow-up, similarly on just sort of the enterprise side, I think you talked a about little bit of competitiveness, you are not the only ones to talk about that on SSDs in the last couple months. Is there a reason to believe that that sort of is temporary in nature from a demand side putting aside from the supply issues?
Mark Durcan: I think overall we think yes the penetration in enterprise is so low that we think it's likely that there tends to be a better market going forward and we are going to invest as such. Some of our competitiveness comments are really more around value segment, consumer and channel SSD-type products that are really driven by kind of a cost approach and not a performance approach.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman from Sterne Agee CRT. Your question please.
Doug Freedman: I guess if I -- a lot of questions have been asked on the gross margin side, but if I could get a little bit of color around the revenue. We are looking at a revenue decline quarter-on-quarter of 9% at the mid-point. What are the pieces that are driving that, I am looking at sort of the bit growth side here and just struggling to come up to see, to align your longer term bit growth outlook with what’s going on in the near-term, so if you could help me understand what are the pieces to the top-line that would be helpful?
Mark Durcan: So, I don’t think it's too dissimilar a story from the discussion we had about margins which is you know we've talked about the fact that for the first couple of quarters of this fiscal year our bit growth is going to be limited. Now we are growing bits however in the face of some of the pricing pressures that we’ve seen in PCs, our PC DRAM space et cetera, that is not enough to overcome you know the bit growth doesn't quite overcome the pricing and that leads to the revenue circumstances as you heard both Mark and Mark speak about today in terms of those things are going to drive our bit growth in the second half of this fiscal year and into you know fiscal '17 those are still well on-track which would be the full deployment of 20-nanometer throughout the DRAM space, as well as the 3D NAND conversion.
Mark Adams: Yes Doug, let me just add you know as we, as we do this substantial ramp of 20-nanometer we have a lot of new products to qualify as well. And so getting complete certainty as to exactly when all these products are going to qualify and when we will ship that product is difficult although we have complete confidence that we will qualify them and that they will be delivered. So there is that dynamic and that aspect as well which is I mean you know associated with ramping a lot of new products simultaneously.
Doug Freedman: I guess for my follow-up if I could, a little bit of a two parter, I just want to make sure I understood, you said your DRAM bit growth would be above industry average of low-20s. Was that for the calendar year or your fiscal year? and then when I look at these transitions that you're going through like 20-nanometer it's one of the things I think investors struggle with is that your results tend to -- we're seeing a much greater oscillation at Micron in sort of the financial performance than we do in your peers over at Samsung and Arnex and yet they go through the same transitions. Why is it that we're seeing such a greater impact to the financials here than we see at your peers?
Mark Durcan: So, a two part question, I relative to the first part, yes it's a calendar reference and it's weighted in the back half of the calendar year. Although we've told you that fiscal Q3 should be a significant step up. Relative to the impact on financial performance I'm going to let Mark comment on that in just a second but I would make the, point that this just sort of reinforces why we need to accelerate the introduction of these technos, because we have fixed operating expenses and in an environment where we're generating less gross margin because we're deploying less advanced technology that takes a bigger bite out of the net picture, Mark do you want to?
Mark Adams: Yes just one other comment. We've communicated all along for many years that as a percentage of our capacity we sell and market our products in these much higher value segments, if you look at ASP per gigabit in NAND and DRAM for example, we've been a market leader in that for as long as I can remember. And when you're not in that model, meaning you're in ramp stage and you're driving these products into lower value segments the volatility and pricing will have a much bigger impact on margins during that time phase.
Ernie Maddock: So Doug, just in summary we look at all this as opportunity and certainly we think we can do better and we intend to do better.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from Cowen and Company, your question please.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot, I had two, I guess the first question is on the Dalian announcements from Intel, I think that happened on the 20th of October so you really haven’t talked publically too much since that and there's still a bit of confusion out there, I guess we understand that you're basically ramping the fab there and for long terms of purposes you're sort of operating it. So I guess my first question is do you have any rights to the output of the fab and do you have the option to invest in the fab? And then I had a follow-up, thanks.
Mark Durcan: So Tim we are not operating the fab, we're not ramping the fab, Intel is our partner and we're helping facilitate the deployment of the technology to that fab. So, that relationship remains healthy and we would expect that as Intel progresses with their ramp of the manufacturing technology there, at some point we will have more discussions about whether it makes sense for increased collaboration at that site, we're not involved today.
Timothy Arcuri: And then I guess the second question, I think John asked a question previously about cost and whether the headwinds start to weigh in after this current quarter and it sounds like they do and you should get a little bit better PC pricing environment per -- I think Mark your comments as well. So, I guess my question is, is it fair to say that the February quarter is the bottom in gross margin if you sort of assume those two factors? Thanks.
Mark Durcan: Well, again we got to stay away from or we're going to stay away from projecting ASPs with, but in terms of our internal operational leverage we think things get a lot better in Q3.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Your question please.
Vijay Rakesh: I had a question on Inotera here, what percent of the 20-nanometer output at the Inotera is DDR3 versus DDR4 today? And at 20-nanometer also is the DDR4 cost still higher than DDR3?
Mark Durcan: I don't have the DDR3, DDR4 mix by fab and I think we want to stay away from giving you that fab specific information, anyway. I'm sorry the second part of the question was DDR4 crossover?
Vijay Rakesh: Yes, is the 20-nanometer DDR4 cost higher than DDR3?
Mark Durcan: 20-nanometer DDR4 cost…
Mark Adams: Yes, we commented on that a little bit earlier, not an 8 gigabit but we would expect that as we ramp-up and crossover that we will be at parity and actually see some reductions but at present it’s fair to think about it as a headwind for us.
Vijay Rakesh: And on the 3D NAND side I know you mentioned second-gen 3D NAND kind of in the second half '16, is that kind of a 64 layer 3D NAND and just as a background what percent of output today is on 3D, I know you said you shipped some here?
Mark Durcan: We haven't said what our gen-2 technology looks like exactly but you can count on it being a significant improvement in both grid density and cost. And sorry the second part of the question…?
Mark Adams: What percent of 3D?
Mark Durcan: Percent of 3D is it's relatively small today but ramping fairly aggressively and again as we get into the second half of next year we'll actually be into the new fab expansion as well. So, it'll really takeoff then.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann from Raymond James. Your question please.
Hans Mosesmann: A question on the 3D XPoint, can you give us a little more flavor, I forget if you actually been commented so far on the call regarding this but can you give us a sense on the ramp and is there change in the nuance of the opportunity as being used in as main memory or is it a storage?
Mark Durcan: Well I think it targets both, main memory and storage applications overtime, probably a higher value in the near memory then in, and then in the storage applications but could be targeted at both. We're really more in an enablement mode as opposed to a significant production ramp today, but we think the revenue does become significant out in 2017 and more so in 2018.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Newman, Bernstein. Your question please.
Mark Newman: I wanted to ask a question again on 20-nanometer ramp, so it seems like from the comments that schedule is ramping pretty much in line with what you're saying about half of production within the May quarter, but based on this gross margin guidance again it is coming down quite a lot, it seems like the cost isn't quite performing at least not in FQ2 yet, so I am wondering is this because of poor yields than expected on 20-nanometer, is there any difference in the yields on 20-nanometer than your expectations versus previous nodes or is it just that the 20-nanometer that you're starting to produce which I assumed should be a fairly significant portion in FQ2 is really being held more in inventory and such not really impacting the top-line and the cost?
Mark Durcan: Yes there is a dynamic that as you ramp new technologies you have to get those products qualified, but they don't necessary always flow out to the customer quite as quickly, so there is an inventory dynamic that you're referencing. I think the bigger issue is that when you're ramping new technologies, it just takes awhile to get the tools ramped and loaded and get that output out and the cost reductions do come they just don't come quite as quickly as people anticipate. We're on-track or slightly ahead of where we expected to be from a yield perspective, so everything is progressing nicely there. Obviously ASPs are a lot lower than we thought they were going to be.
Mark Newman: So as we look forward to the backend of the fiscal year, so if you look forward to FQ3 the May quarter then we should see a much -- we should see some of this cost decline finally happened, I think that's probably fair to assume and can we assume that the previous guidance for the cost decline from 20-nanometer that you've guided as earlier is still intact but just more backend of the fiscal year and rather than the front-end?
Mark Durcan: Yes, I think we said for quite awhile Mark that fiscal Q3 is when you should really start to see the impact from 20-nanometer ramp and all the guidance we've given over previous quarters I think it is still on-track and intact.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ian Ing from MKM Partners. Your question please.
Ian Ing: Yes, thanks, could you talk about your assumptions on keeping mobile DRAM in supply demand balance this next year, I mean, there is a lot of unit variability at the big OEMs that given how that plays out, would you ever consider not to trying to over shift the industry?
Mark Durcan: Well certainly look at that dynamic, our view of the world is that even with that variability that you're projecting, there is a content increase for device that we feel comfortable mutes that out and so we think over the long run mobile is pretty solid. And again we're taking a look at all the market segments and there is networking we think will continue to be a good market for us hyper-scale servers as well as there is some balancing will do in general, but all-in-all we think mobile is a good place over the long run.
Ian Ing: Okay thanks and then in the DRAM server market, I mean, you talked about some pricing pressure, could you talk more about the sources of demand and the server side the next few quarters, there are some mixed signals out there you've got some suppliers talking about enterprise being stronger than cloud customer, I mean, any workloads that you're excited about the next few quarters?
Mark Durcan: All-in-all, I would say the enterprise market of the two appears to be more favorable for us. Datacenter is a little bit more commoditized I think. Some of the datacenters materials sometimes could be consumed with high-end PC grade material. But overall we think that the projection of the market in servers gets us in a new pretty good growth environment and as we look at that server again like mobile, we have a good market for us we're not -- we don’t think it's a challenge for us as far as adding growth in the bits to that segment.
Operator: Certainly, our final question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill from Needham & Company. Your question please.
Rajvindra Gill: There have been some recent reports that a major competitor of yours could have 18-nanometer DRAM by the second quarter, calendar second quarter of next year, given the transition to 20-nanometer this year and next year, how do you think this impacts your competitive position in the overall market from a supply demand perspective?
Mark Durcan: That's a relatively muted step from 20 to 18 and relative to that particular competitor we think there are also some architectural changes that will cost them some rate efficiency, so we believe that notwithstanding the fact that other competitors will continue to migrate their technology at a more muted pace on a go forward basis we will continue to narrow the gap.
Rajvindra Gill: And just switching gears to the Inotera, how does the Inotera buyout affect your CapEx plans and will the Company plan to utilize Inotera's cash flow for non-DRAM products such as 3D XPoint, is that the also one of the purposes a little bit as well?
Mark Durcan: What we touched on the announcement that was on average, you'd expect to see Inotera add somewhere around $800 million a year to our CapEx that we have previously discussed and the reality is cash fungible, so it will add cash flow into the Company and the Company will direct that cash flow where it sees best so the idea of specifically saying that cash flow would be used for 3D XPoint is sort of a mute issue.

Thank you very much and before I turn the call over to Mark Durcan, we want to make a quick update. There was some information posted on our website under the earnings slides which were posted to micron.com on page 20, the Summary Key Data slide. It does include some errors on the Q1 2016 guidance. That is being updated and will be replaced shortly. Please note page 17 is accurate which shows our fiscal Q1 ’16 non-GAAP guidance on that page.  So with that I will turn it over to Mark Durcan. 
Mark Durcan: Thank you, Ivan. For fiscal Q4 2015, Micron posted total revenue of $3.6 billion within our revenue guidance of $3.45 billion to $3.7 billion. Revenue was sequentially lower as expected in fiscal Q4 due to near term market headwinds, driven primarily by weakness in the PC sector. Micron posted overall gross margins of 27%, while generating operating cash flow of over $1 billion.  Non-GAAP net income was $399 million and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.37. We are pleased with the execution that delivered these results. We continue to invest in our business with capital expenditures of $1.85 billion in Q4 as well as ongoing investments in technology and product development.  For fiscal year 2015, we achieved revenue of $16.2 billion, $2.72 per share in non-GAAP earnings, $5.2 billion in cash from operations, and $2.3 billion in dilution management activities, including convert retirements and over $800 million in share repurchases.  While fourth quarter results were impacted by continued weakness in the PC sector, we believe that memory industry fundamentals remain favorable over the long term, and we are focused on improving our competitive position due to deployment of Advanced Technologies and System Level solutions. Reflecting on market conditions, despite the recent softness in the PC market, we continue to see healthy end market demand in other segments. Within the context of that variability, we will continue to manage product mix and allocate our capacity to maximize our opportunities over time.  Demand for NAND is relatively stable. We are encouraged by customer response to early sample of our 16-nanometer TLC products, as well as a significant customer interest in our early 3D NAND product. We expect the majority of our NAND production on 3D by late calendar 2016, which should put us in a stronger competitive position.  We expect the demand environment to stabilize and improve as we move through calendar 2016. In general, we expect the industry supply and demand for both DRAM and NAND to be relatively balanced in 2016.  Stepping back for a minute, Micron produces technologically advanced subsystems and systems for global market place, and today’s customers are looking for value added memory solutions to drive innovation and efficiency in system design. This creates a tremendous opportunity for Micron moving forward, and we’ll continue to invest to enhance our competitive position.  Relative to those investments, Micron’s capital investments are primarily focused towards the deployment of advanced technology to drive manufacturing efficiency and to enable innovative new products to support technology advancement in our NAND business.  We are also investing in an expansion of our clean room facility to enable cost effective 3D NAND and are continuing to support R&D facilities in Boise. These investments in aggregate will accelerate Micron’s big growth over the next 12 to 18 months. For DRAM, we expect to be above market for calendar year 2016, based on market growth assumption of low to mid 20s. A majority of this growth will occur in the latter half of Micron’s fiscal 2016 and then continue into fiscal 2017.  For trade NAND, we expect our bit growth to be below the market in calendar 2015 and 2016 based on our market growth assumption of mid to high 30s and as 3D conversion reduces wafer output in the near term. For our Fab 10X expansion and 3D conversions, we expect it will position us to significantly outgrow the market for NAND in fiscal 2017.  On the call today, Mark Adams will summarize our operational and EBU results. Ernie Maddock, will cover Q4 financial results, and I will conclude will a couple of thoughts prior to Q&A. Mark?
Mark Adams: Thank you, Mark. I will begin by reviewing our performance in DRAM and Non-Volatile memory, which on a going forward basis will include our NAND and 3D cross point product. I will follow an update on each of our four business units before closing with commentary on our operational performance and focus.  Let’s begin with DRAM, which represented 60% of our total revenue in fiscal Q4. PC DRAM ASPs remained under pressure in Q4. As a result, gross margins were down sequentially, in line with our expectations. While we did see some mild spiller effect to pricing in other DRAM segments, overall gross margin in these other segments, and demand remained relatively healthy.  As a percentage of DRAM revenue in fiscal Q4, mobile was in the low 30% up from the high 20% in Q3. The PC segment was in the low 20 percentile, down from about 30% in the prior quarter. The server business was in the low-to-mid-20%, up from the low-20% in Q3 and their especially DRAM business which includes networking, graphics, automotive and other embedded markets was in the low 20 percentile in aggregate. Moving on to our Non-Volatile memory business, trade revenue represented 32% of total revenue in fiscal Q4. Performance was consistent with our guidance highlighted by stable gross margins. As a percent of trade, Non-Volatile memory revenues in fiscal Q4, consumer represented about 40%; that includes our cards, USB, and components. Mobile included in multi chip packages was in the low 20%. SSDs were in the mid-teens, and Automotive and Industrial mid-markets and other embedded segments were in mid-teens as well, while 3D cross point technology was immaterial. These percentages were generally consistent with the prior quarter.  Positive mix effects, including growth and enterprise SSDs and a reduction of our spot market more transactional type businesses led to stable ASPs and gross margins for our Non-Volatile memory business.  Moving on to our business units, our compute and networking business unit posted revenue of $1.3 billion in fiscal Q4, down 14% versus the prior quarter with operating income of $99 million or 7.6%. When looking at the fourth fiscal quarter, CNBU was impacted by lower ASPs driven by continued softness in demand from the PC segment.  In response to this softness, we reduced our bit shipments into the PC segment by approximately 20% and shifted bits toward other more stable segments. We anticipate additional reduction in PC-DRAM production in the fiscal Q1 of 2016.  CNBU had a very strong quarter in the enterprise segment. We were able to drive additional qualifications of our 8 gigabit DDR4 solutions resulting in shipments of DDR4 increasing by more than double of Q3’s volume.  The performance driven workloads and compute intensive applications in the enterprise space should drive additional demand growth in the future. We are confident that the migration of our product portfolio to our 20 nanometer technology will put us in a great position to support this growth in the future. The networking segment continued to be stable, and over time we expect to see demand in this space increase as build out of LTE deployment in emerging markets continues.  Revenues in Micron’s storage business unit were $848 million in fiscal Q4, down 6% sequentially. SBU’s gross margins were flat quarter over quarter. Operating margins were negative, reflecting our continued investment in development of next generation Flash-storage technologies.  SBU continues to focus on optimizing the mix of our products to mitigate transactional market exposure while serving higher value segments. One good example is in the enterprise segment. We continue to gain traction in the deployment of Micron branded SSDs in the hyper scale segment with our M500 SSD family based products focused on high reliable and high performance 20 nanometer NLC product.  While in entry level client segments TLC NAND Flash has been deployed due to cost benefits, we have had many customers come in with outside requests for our MLC based technology to truly meet the demand of the end market needs.  We continue to make progress in TLC as well during Q4, which will help us better serve the lower end value segments in NAND. Our 16-nanometer planar TLC NAND was qualified with several customers. We began shipping components in the quarter and will begin shipping consumer SSDs based on TLC in the current quarter.  Revenue of mobile was $958 million in fiscal Q4, up slightly sequentially. Operating income was $262 million. Micron’s Mobile business unit continues to benefit from evolving mobile system architectures that steadily increase memory density requirements at all product levels.  Our broad and diverse product portfolio, including eMCPs, PoP DRAM and KGD which is commonly known for known good dye allows us to maximize our operating results by rapidly adjusting to changing customer requirements and marketing conditions.  Despite slower growth in China, revenue in the overall AMCD product category was flat when compared to Q3. As AMCD densities continues to increase, our combined DRAM and NAND portfolio only strengthens our competitive position. Micron has ramped production in low power DDR4 with shipment increasing from 4% to 24% of total Mobile DRAM volume and expects LP4 volumes to surpass LP3 by the end of our first half of the fiscal 2016.  The embedded business unit posted revenue of $474 million, down approximately 2% from prior quarter. Gross margins for EBU were 35%, up 2% as planned when compared to Q3. Operating margins were 22%, also up 2 percentage points when compared to the prior quarter. It is worthy to note EBUs revenue reached $2 billion in fiscal year 2015, which is a big milestone for our business unit that has historically been our most stable profitable business.  Fiscal Q4 results were driven by record revenue in our automotive segment and continuous strength in our industrial multimarket business. Growth in Automotive supporting applications including Infotainment, Instrument Cluster and ADAS which stands for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems drove record sales of DDR3 and eMMC.  Japanese regulatory changes has been a catalyst for strong demand in our amusement business driving shipments of NOR and NAND base Multi Chip products that support machine-to-machine communication models.  I want to close with some updates on technology development and deployment activities. At our Summer Analyst Conference we described our fiscal year ’15 and ’16 strategic investment priority focus. We continue to be pleased with our progress across our focus areas of DRAM, Non-Volatile and emerging memory.  We are ahead of our previously communicated schedule on both the 20 nanometer DRAM and 3D NAND conversions. We expect 20 nanometer to represent more than half of our DRAM output in fiscal year 2016 and our 3D NAND is on track to be a majority of our NAND output by the end of the calendar year 2016. An important milestone for our 3D NAND progress is beginning tool installation in the Singapore Fab by the spring of 2016 and we are on track to meet that timeline.  In the quarter we announced 3D cross point technology and our effect for commercial shipment in calendar year 2016. This is an exciting new memory technology which has the potential to drive innovative new memory intensive applications.  We also continue to expand our strategic customer and partner relationships exemplified by our recently announced 3D Cross Point technology and 3D NAND supply agreements with Intel. As we continue to execute our technology conversion and Fab expansion plans, these types of strategic relationships can offer another path to enable our technology in the market, as well as they can provide additional capital to support technology transitions.  With this successful execution in technology development, we are confident that our relative competitiveness will improve during fiscal year 2016. We believe that the ongoing growth in customer demand for memory products will provide healthier market conditions going forward.  Now to continue our commentary on fiscal Q4 results and Q1 guidance, I will turn the call over to Ernie. 
Ernie Maddock: Thanks Mark. Our GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $471 million, $0.42 per diluted share or net sales of $3.6 billion. Compared to the third quarter margins declined primarily as a result of pricing in the DRAM space.  Non-GAAP income for the fourth quarter reflections adjustment for the following: Recurring adjustments for the amortization of debt discounts primarily relating to the imputed interest on the convertible notes of the MMJ Creditor debt and nominal amounts for the loss of our debt restructuring activities and the effects of changes and currency exchange rates for the quarter.  Technology acquisitions or technology related acquisitions in the quarter resulted in a $21 million gain from the re-measurement from a previous equity method investment held in the acquired entity, as well as $21 million in tax benefits recognized in the purchase accounting.  Non-cash taxes relating to the MMJ and MMT operations reflected a benefit in the quarter primarily as the result of increased estimated utilization on operating loss carry forwards in Japan. As a result our non-GAAP income was $399 million or $0.37 per share.  As a reminder, Micron includes both amortization of acquisition intangibles and stock based compensation expense in our non-GAAP reporting. Taken together these two items represent approximately $0.04 per share for the recently completed quarter.  Now let’s look at our results by product line. Historically we’ve referred to our product classification as DRAM and NAND. As Mark Adams just noted, rather than NAND we will refer to Non-Volatile, which includes NAND and 3D Cross Point, but will continue to exclude NOR. DRAM revenue decreased approximately 8% compared to the third quarter, primarily as the result of lower selling prices. DRAM gross margin was in the 30% range, lower than the previous quarter.  On the trade NAND Non-Volatile side revenue decreased approximately 7% in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of lower bit sales volume. Gross margin was relatively flat compared to the prior quarter in the low to mid 20% range. Both bit cost and selling prices decreased slightly for the quarter.  In the quarter the company generated operating cash flow of $1 billion and ended the quarter with $5.6 billion in cash and marketable investments. Expenditures for property, plant and equipment during the quarter were approximately $1.85 billion. During the fourth quarter we repurchased $63 million in face value of convertible notes for $112 million and approximately 36 million shares of common stock for $638 million for a total of $750 million.  Operating expense was less than anticipated in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of lower variable compensation expense and lower volumes of wafers used for development of new products and technologies.  For the full year fiscal 2015 ended September 3, net sales were $16.2 billion with GAAP net income of $2.9 billion or $2.47 per diluted share while non-GAAP net income was $3.1 billion or $2.72 per diluted share. The impact of acquisition intangibles and stock based compensation on our full year non-GAAP results was approximately $0.13 per share.  As Mark Durcan noted during FY2015, we used approximately $3.2 billion of dilution management activities. Out of this total $832 million was spent on share repurchase and the remainder on convertible retirements.  Cash expenditures for property plans and equipment during fiscal 2015 were $4.1 billion and we continued to expect fiscal 2016 capital expenditures to be in the $5.3 billion to $5.8 billion range. We also continue to expect third quarter investments of between $700 million and $900 million, as well as $600 million to $800 million expense for our 3D NAND Fab 10X expansion in Singapore.  As mentioned in our Summer Analyst Conference, we are simplifying the guidance that we provide. For Micron’s first fiscal quarter 2016, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows: Consolidated revenue in the range of $3.35 billion to $3.6 billion; gross margin in the range of 24.5% to 27%; operating expenses between $580 million and $620 million and operating income between $260 million and $320 million with EPS between $0.20 and $0.26 per diluted share based on an estimate of 1.1 billion diluted shares and a tax rate in the mid-teens. This EPS range includes expenses related to acquisition intangibles and stock based compensation which together represent approximately $0.05 per share.  Although we continue to expect some challenges in the pricing environment during the current fiscal quarter, our guidance particularly at the gross margin line also reflects that early capture of operational improvements that we have been sharing with you for some time. In the materials posted on our website, we have included a dilution table that reflects the anti-dilutive effects of our cap calls at various stock prices.  Now, I’ll turn it back over to Mar Durcan.
Mark Durcan : Thank you, Ernie. Let me just conclude our prepared remarks by summarizing our major focus areas for the coming year; there are three such focus areas. First is technology development and manufacturing efficiency, second is delivering value added solutions for a growing set of customers and market segments, and third is investment in our long term customer and partner relationships.  As we embark on our new fiscal year I’d like to take a moment to thank our customers, partners, shareholders and team members for their continued support.  Let me stop here and operator I think we are ready for Q&A. 
Ivan Donaldson: We’ll now take questions from callers. [Operator Instructions]. Operator.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy with Stifel. Your line is open.
Kevin Cassidy : Thank you for taking my question. Just on the guidance for gross margin, can you give us some of the moving parts on that, where it’s coming down?
Mark Durcan: You know, as always it’s a combination of mix and pricing, and both of those move around within ranges that are quite similar to one another, so part of the reason why we wanted to talk to you about an aggregate gross margin was in fact that both of those factors are things in some cases that we don’t control and in other cases that we do in response to the changing pricing environment, so we can’t really provide too much color on that or else it would sort of negate why we chose to go to this more broad based guidance across the company’s revenue stream. 
Kevin Cassidy : Okay. Maybe if I could just ask one detail around that. With the TLC NAND products ramping or becoming a larger percentage of revenue, should we expect that gross margins can move up with that ramp? 
Mark Durcan: I think the ramp through fiscal year 2016 will generally lead to that trend. Certainly from a cost base, it’s not trying to forecast where the ASPs go from here, from a competitive cost position, yes.
Kevin Cassidy : Okay, great. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Your line is open.
Vijay Rakesh: Yes, hi. Thanks. Just a question here; if you look at first half ’16, what do you think your mix will be on 16 nanometer TLC NAND, and I have a follow-up. Thanks.
Mark Durcan: So we’re early in the ramp of the TLC NAND. We’re shipping products this quarter to customers, but as we move through the first half of the year, it will be into the 20% range and we’ll see where it goes from there.
Ernie Maddock: If I could just add one more comment that what we’re hearing and seeing from the market is that by segment TLC is entering in some segments, but not all segments. As a matter of fact, in the last part of Q4 and early into Q1, we’ve seen significant interest for our higher performing, more reliable MLC, both 20 and 25 nanometer products where they are designed in and even new customers in the hyper scale environment, and so while 20% might not sound as high as one would have forecasted six months ago, we’re getting significant interest again in enterprise type applications for better margins, and so we’re going to dial that in around market opportunity and customer needs.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. And if I may on the DRAM side, as you look at – you mentioned things should just improve through kind of ’16, but any thoughts on how you see inventory and yields playing out here through the end of the year. Thanks.
Mark Durcan: Did you say, were you saying yields?
Vijay Rakesh: Yes, yields and just channel inventory on the DRAM side. Thanks.
Mark Durcan: Let me add all the channel inventory in the market. Interestingly enough, in terms of DRAM market, except for one large channel player, the channel itself is pretty low inventory in the two to three weeks, and one larger channel player who in fact services a lot of the OEMs has more than that from the fulfillment standpoint, that’s the role that they play with these customers. So it’s not a significant inventory problem in the channel today. I think to extend the question a little bit, the PC demand, the PC ecosystem is also not as much of an inventory problem as more of a demand problem, and I think with new chipsets and new operating assistance and what have you, I think the buying side of the market has been a little conservative in terms of how they procured PC parts over the last three to six months, and I think it’s at this point, this could be interesting to watch how the next three or four months plays out in terms of the consumer and corporate behavior, because at some point they are going to start to replenish.
Ernie Maddock: Let me handle the yield question. I think the thing we can say about yield is we’re clearly ahead of our plan and running at least as good as or probably slightly better than we have on previous similar conversions. So we’re very happy with the way that that’s going, and we look for a significant bit generation and bit crossover in our third fiscal quarter.
Vijay Rakesh: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I had two. Ernie, I know you don’t want to talk too much about cost going forward, but that’s obviously been an issue. DRAM costs were up this quarter, and the guidance seems to imply that DRAM costs per bit is going to go down just a touch in fiscal Q1. Is that right?
Ernie Maddock: If you go back to the chart that we showed in our Analyst Day, it sort of shows you what we’re expecting in general relative to output, and cost move in an impressed way with output. So as output moves up, costs decline a little bit.  In addition to that as we move down the technology curve, we also get the benefit of that. So without being overly specific, I think the best thing I can do is refer you back to that curve, and the gross margin guidance we have provided and you can sort of draw the picture from there.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay, thanks. Then I guess Ernie, also there’s a lot of debate about when gross margins will bottom and where it will bottom. So can you – you’re beginning to see some benefit of the investments in the operational things you’re doing. So can you give us some sense that maybe you think that November might be the bottoming in gross margin.
Ernie Maddock: I can’t really comment on that, and again, I’d refer you back to some of the major levers that we have, which is output that we can control and whatnot, but the biggest lever of all is pricing which is something that we can’t fully anticipate. So, I can’t really give you any indication that November would be the bottom, because I just don’t know at this point, although we continue to make progress on our operational improvements.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay Ernie, thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill with Needham and Co. Your line is open.
Rajvindra Gill: Yes, thanks for taking my question. Just I guess a follow-up on the gross margin. I am trying to get a sense of why gross margins are coming down and if some of these things that you talked about are stabilizing, for instance more rational environment and in more in 20 nanometer, some stabilization in the pricing.
Mark Durcan: Yes. So I think it’s really important to sort of parse cost and pricing. If you look at what’s happening in the market, there is still a significant amount of data that suggest DRAM pricing continues to come down a bit and so that has an offsetting impact to the improvements and the operational execution. So we’re really focused on driving the operational execution and getting costs where as well as we can effectively manage costs to get those to that level and then the pricing environment we have to deal with.
Rajvindra Gill: Yes, I’m just trying to square with what you’re saying in your outlook, in your slide deck. You basically are saying despite recent softness the PC DRAM market continues to see healthy end market demand and the demand environment just stabilized as we move into calendar ’16. So this means like while there is some hint that demand is stabilizing or some stabilization across the board the more you continue to drift fairly well. So I’m not very clear on why that’s happening.
Mark Durcan: Yes, okay. Well you know let’s just step back a little bit and think about – the marketplace has been weakened in PCs. We’ve seen pricing erosion there. It doesn’t take much of a shift in the supply and demand balance where your moving big numbers up and down and subtracting them to get a difference for the supply demand balance to swing from slightly over to slightly under supply. At the end of the day that’s the tough question that we’ve all got to try and figure out what the answer it.  But as we think about what our end markets look like in 2016, the products we have and the customer interest we have, we think that the market is generally going to be relatively balanced and we think we have significant operational improvements coming on the pipeline. So that sort of underlines the commentary we’re giving you and we’re trying to give you a view as to how we think that’s going to balance out in the quarter ahead and its close to flattish gross margins quarter-over-quarter based on our guidance and we just have to go from there and see. We’re all trying to figure this out together.
Rajvindra Gill: Okay, great. And just last question on the cost side. Some of the cost headwinds that you experienced this year, they really should become tailwinds in 2016 and I was wondering if you can talk about some of those potential tailwinds and any thoughts on the shift to DDR4 and server, the shift to mobile overall and within mobile the shift to LPDDR4. These are all things that could potentially be tailwind once costs are normalized. So if you can maybe talk about some of those specific things that would be helpful. Thank you.
Mark Adams: Surely, this is Mark Adams just responding to the last part of your question. I think that if you break all of that down, certainly DDR4 and LP4 in their early ramp don’t lend themselves to the cost benefits right away like any other semiconductor ramps that you deal with in terms of the market, and so we will see that shift from early ramp headwind to advanced process tailwind in the mid part of our fiscal year.  That’s also true with our 20 nanometer product coming out in the – by the time – I said in the second half of my script, second half – at the end of the first half going to the second half we’ll be at bit crossover. More than 50% of our production will be on the 20 nanometer and we’ll be in an improved position there as well. So all in all I think what you’re asking about, we can confirm is the direction we see our cost position in the marketplace.
Rajvindra Gill: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with Sterne Agee. Your line is open.
Doug Freedman: Great. Thanks for taking my question guys. Mark, in the past you’ve offered commentary in terms of the impact of the new contract with Inotera. Given the present pricing dynamics in the market, in the DRAM market, can you offer us some insights into how much impact that will have on gross margins when it kicks in in the February quarter?
Mark Durcan: Yes Doug, we commented on this last quarter. It’s still mid to high single digits impact in fiscal Q3 as we realized the sort of the transition to the updated 20 nanometer technology coming out of Inotera.
Doug Freedman: Okay, and that’s just on – just to make sure I understand that correctly, that’s just on the DRAM side of the business. So if we aggregate that into corporate…
Mark Durcan: That’s right. It’s just DRAM and that’s just on the Inotera output. The fiscal Q3 is the role and the time the contract kicks in at the beginning of the year, but there’s a lag effect in terms of when it flows through our financials and that’s just the best time to look at it, because that also happens to be in the 20 nanometer output.
Doug Freedman: So we’ll see that impacting the May quarter then not in the February quarter. Great, that’s very helpful. If I could move on, my next one is really in looking at the NAND market and your NAND output. I know you mentioned not moving as quickly to TLC because of market demands. There really are two different products that you’re ramping right now if I’m correct. You got the TLC at 15 nanometer, but you also have your 3D product. I know you gave us an endpoint that you’ll be at a majority of 3D by the end of ’16. Can we get any interim points to the November and maybe February quarter? What percentage of your output will be 3D NAND and how much of that will be MLC versus TLC.
Mark Durcan: Let me take that one Doug. So your right, we’re going to play this by ear, right, in terms of the planer TLC. As Mark mentioned there is a sort of resurgence in interest in our high quality MLC offerings for enterprise and high inclined applications and so we’re just going to have to see how we dial that piece.  You’re also right that we said our plan is to have the majority of our 3D NAND on TLC in short order. It’s still a new technology, it’s still ramping and I think it’s probably a little premature to try and predict what that looks like in the 3D TLC, what that mix looks like in the first half of the year.
Doug Freedman: How about total output for the November, February quarters?
Mark Durcan: Of TLC?
Doug Freedman: Of 3D NANDs in any flavor.
Mark Durcan: Oh! Of 3D NANDs. It’s going to be relatively small until we get to that crossover point.
Doug Freedman: That’s great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.
Monika Garg: Hi, thanks for taking my question. The first question I have is on the SBU business unit. We have seen negative up margins for two, three quarters now and you’ve talked about like 3D NAND is more end of calendar ’16 weighted. So is it fair to think that your NAND – I mean when do you expect your NAND margins to improve, when 3D picks up or sometime even before that.
Mark Durcan: I think its important Monika, again its Mark Adam. I think it’s important to make a distinction here. Directionally your characterization of our SBU margins are correct, but I would also suggest on a relative basis to our competitors, our SBU business has held up quite nicely relative to where we were 12 months ago and I mean that because there’s a number of different market segments that the team has developed and cultivated that we feel will continue to benefit as we get some of the tailwinds in place that we described in the back half of ’16.  So, it’s a long winded way of saying I expect that on a relative basis we get more competitive in ’16 and that our overall performance in SBU will improve based on a number of the elements we’ve talked about, whether it be TLC or vertical and some of the higher end enterprise type products that we described.
Ernie Maddock: Keep in mind, when you look at SBU numbers, your also looking at a blended trade and zero gross margin business report.
Monika Garg: Got it. Okay, just a last one on the DRAM side. Mark you talked about you expect relatively balanced supply demand in DRAM in 2016. The Micron’s DRAM margins have come down quite a bit this year. If it’s a balanced environment next year, should we expect the margins to improve next year then? 
Mark Durcan: Again it’s Mark. We can’t predict the ASPs and the margins for you. We are just telling you what we generally see and then you got to layer in that obviously we are pretty bullish on what we are doing internally and our operational improvements that will play out through the year. 
Monika Garg: Okay. Thank you. 
Mark Durcan: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Hemmelgarn with Barclays. Your line is open. 
Chris Hemmelgarn: Thanks very much for taking the question. I guess taking a little different tact, could you talk a bit about the factors that would get you to the high end, low end of your gross margin guidance?
Ernie Maddock: Well, ASPs are big one right. We always reserve the right to dial mix and we’ll take advantage of any opportunities we see there. I think we have a pretty good beat on what our output is going to be absent some dramatic mix changes. So I don’t think that’s as big a lever in this particular quarter. 
Chris Hemmelgarn: Okay, thanks very much. I guess different direction. Talk a bit of 3D. Intel’s clearly going to be pushing the technology, but in terms of monetizing it from the Micron end, where specifically are you seeing strong customer interest? 
Mark Durcan: I’ll see your different tact, with my different tact, how is that? More broadly the technology, we see in a number of different end market segments both in current application environments and in some kind of innovative new areas that might drive some new development on just solutions and technologies to address markets.  The type of markets that we see, 3D Cross Point benefit from are either super high end gaming applications, which could be for just more real environment 8K type applications and provide the exact gaming performance that doesn’t have to flush out to a different type of storage media. It all could be done in 3D Cross Point. Another good one would be super high end and reliable system storage, enterprise storage applications.  We think as far as emerging application development, we think the technology lends really well to medical diagnostics for example, where the instantaneous response time of symptoms going in and research data analysis coming out, what that might be as a real world application that could benefit from Cross Point. So these are type of markets that the technology fits and I think that it’s just a quick summary of few that are of interest to where the market can drive this technology. 
Ernie Maddock: Think in terms of anywhere where you want a large in memory database or anywhere where you want ultra high performance storage systems. 
Chris Hemmelgarn: It’s very helpful. Thanks soo much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open. 
Steven Fox: Thanks. Good afternoon. Just one question from me. You mentioned that there was some spillover effect in the DRAM market into some of your better mix markets in the last quarter. I guess I was curious, do you expect to see that in this quarter. How much could compute seasonality lead to some more spillover later on in the fiscal year and what are you guys doing to sort of firewall against that. Thanks.
Mark Durcan: Well I think the big, you sad something there as how much can compute seasonality effect and it depends on how you see the compute market. What I mentioned earlier was some of the environments that consumer similar capacity like the very low end part of the server business has some pricing pressure. Notwithstanding all that margins held up pretty well.  So my interpretation to your question is that PCs rebound somewhat and we are not talking about a wild rebound, but they rebound somewhat going into the holiday season. That could have a positive impact on overall pricing in the market. But we think that the diversification of the end markets lends well to relatively stable pricing in margin as Ernie highlighted. 
Steven Fox: Just a quick follow-up on what you just said. Is there any kind of tactics you are willing to share in terms of what your most focused on in sort of shaping demand to your benefit when you see some of these excesses the next couple of quarters. 
Mark Durcan: Well, I mean mot more than what we’ve talked about in the past, which is we have these end markets that we have developed, product strategies and by shifting some of the capacities away, it relieves some of the pressure in one area and the interesting thing overall about DRAM which we haven’t really talked a lot about is some of these newer categories LP4, DDR4, some of these categories actually take or have a limiting effect or reducing effecting on overall wafer production in the industry. And so as these categories take off and grow, we are of the opinion that that could have a stabilizing effect too. 
Steven Fox: Great, thank you very much. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the lines of Steven Chin with UBS. Your line is open. 
Steven Chin: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First one Mark, if I could on the demand side, both on PC and SmartPhones. Could you provide a little color on what your hearing from your customers in those two end markets in terms of resentment [ph] and sort of how the seasonality “for the back half” how that’s shaping up so far relative to expectations. 
Mark Durcan: Well I think the PC is about where it’s been. I can’t advertise there’s been a major uptick in PC demand. The only data point that I would say that is new for us is that as we sit today the relative channel inventory in PCs is not a huge burden to a recovery. I think that it’s too early to tell what consumers and even in the corporate environment are going to be doing through the holiday and through the rest of the year. So I can’t give you a great sense of what’s going to play out other than the inventory validation of what we see in the channel and that’s true not only for end units and PC. It is also overall true for PC memory relative to where the pricing pressure has been. So I don’t think it’s going to take a wild shift in behavior for PC environment to stabilize. It’s just, it’s probably too early for the holidays to see that.  On the mobile side, despite what we’ve read in the media about slowdown in China, which in fact is somewhat true, there seems to be an offset in two areas. One of which is that memory content in phones continues to move upwards, which is more broadly positive, as well as you know despite the high end and mid range SmartPhones in China, the entry level SmartPhone which are really configured to be pretty good density configurations are still in pretty good shape, coupled with other emerging markets.  So we continue to be bullish on the mobile market and the team’s performance has been pretty good. When you think about some of the areas that we’ve shifted to mobile, networking and automotive, the net of it all has been that we’ve been able to keep our margin in a relatively healthy place and continue to monitor that. 
Steven Chin: Great, thanks for that color Mark. As follow up for Ernie, Ernie in terms of the repurchases if I had my match correct, I think you have about $170 million in share repurchase capacity for this quarter. Just give me how much you bought back in this last quarter and with the stock under $20, any thoughts on potential expansion in your repurchase program. 
Ernie Maddock : So the amounts actually probably a little close to $130 million versus $170 million, and we are certainly going to continue to be opportunistic and as we think about the market during the fourth quarter we’ll be making decisions as we think is appropriate. 
Steven Chin: Okay, great, thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Amir with Ladenburg. Your line is open. 
Daniel Amir: Thanks a lot. So another way, I was just following up to your previous question, how should we look at fiscal year ’16 and kind of the mix, the mix that you are aiming to in terms of the DRAM business, mobile, PC, server. I mean should we expect in general terms PC to decline a little bit more, mobile to a little bit increase and server and networking to stay about the same?
Mark Durcan: It’s difficult to necessarily forecast, because we’ll keep adopting our overall approach as the market conditions weren’t. But if I were to kind of categorize how we see it today, we think mobile and generally will concern more than where we sit today.  We see PC on the consumption side of memory flat to down somewhat just based on the overall market demand and trends that we see. In general we think other embedded markets will only increase given automotive gaming and the launch in growth of the IoT end segments.  Networking and server are very interesting because what we’ve seen in the trends and those two markets are, as much memory as they can get in they will put in and as technology and configuration allow us, DDR4 will drive pretty high growth in terms of memory consumption.  So when you hear us bullish on the overall demand of the end markets, as with good reason memory consumption is really driving either reliability performance or really new market applications and in the DRAM segment we continue notwithstanding of the PC business, we continue to see growth across the board. 
Daniel Amir: Okay, just a follow-up question on kind of the Non-Volatile side. Your SSD business is around mid teens. I guess if we said a year ago, I think some of us would have thought that would be a higher number of your overall sales. What do you need to do in order to make that a bigger focus given the opportunity in SSD? Is it really related to the progress of TLC and 3D NAND or is there something else that you can drive that business forward? 
Mark Durcan: I think that’s true. I think a year ago we might have said that. As things have played out, the low end of the SSD market where a lot of the volume units go, that’s turning to be a bit of a blood bath and in the NAND environment and the TLC pricing, it was just not something we were going to fight with our MLC product when we can go shift that to other market segments.  Secondly, as we think about the mobile business, the mobile business at Micron had a great year in NAND, tremendous growth ’15 over ’14. So we are going to continue to optimize around returns and market attractiveness and between some of the competitive pricing, as well as the growth in mobile we altered our strategy mildly and I think with TLC and with our instance in the vertical, I think you will see SSD has become more prominent, because we think we are going to be in a better position to compete with the rest of the market. 
Daniel Amir: Okay, thanks. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Evercore. Your line is open. 
CJ Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, you sound a little bit more upbeat on your ramp of 20 nanometer and talked about more than half I guess your output in the latter half of fiscal ’16. But I was just curious if we could talk a little bit about not production, but revenues and what that number would look like and what kind of contribution if at all we could see in the February quarter?
Mark Adams: Hey CJ, this is Mark Adams. Unfortunately we are going to probably point on that with the revenue qualification. I would just validate what you started with, which is we are generally very pleased with the ramp and the yield curves that were out today and we see – as we communicated very consistently we see a cross over by the end of our first half fiscal year. So we are very excited about that, not just from a raw cost position perspective, that’s great, but also from a product enablement on 8 gigabyte configurations and can open some doors for us. So without qualifying the revenue number it’s a real positive tailwind for us.
CJ Muse: That’s helpful and I guess Ernie a broader question looking at the February quarter and I know you don’t want to talk about bits and mix and all that. But curious, what should we be thinking of as the most material drivers of up or down kind of impact to gross margins and there I guess thinking about start up cost $20, mix shift given seasonal demand trends for DRAM, any other kind of investments that you are thinking about. How should we think about those moving parts and headwind, tailwind looking out into the February quarter? 
Ernie Maddock: Yes, so obviously the biggest one, we can’t tell you whether it’s a headwind or a tailwind which is market pricing. As we think about the cost side, we should continue to see some improvement as we go further down the curve with 20 nanometer and the 16 nanometer TLC NAND. And then obviously it’s going to be the mix between end markets and as we have talked about before, we do have the ability certainly in the February quarter at this point to think about where we want to direct that mix.  So those are the three big levers and they are going to move in ways that we can’t fully predict right now on the market pricing side, the other two things we are actually thinking about quite carefully right now. 
CJ Muse: Very helpful. Thank you. 
Ivan Donaldson: And operator, I think we have time for one more question. 
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Mark Newman with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Mark Newman : Hi, thanks for squeezing me in. A question on DRAM pricing. PC DRAM was always extremely week – PC DRAM pricing was extremely week during July and August. But since then there has been some significant mix changes in including Micron, both including Samsung as well away from PC DRAM and I think some of the statements recently we sense have indicated they are not learning that PC DRAM price anymore.  So I’m wondering if you are starting to see a stabilization in PC DRAM prices already and also following up to that on the other parts of DRAM, sever and mobile, with all this mix change, is there going to be more weakens in these other parts of the market as we go forward to the rest of the year and into next year, then I have one follow up as well. 
Mark Durcan: Well, that was a pretty good question in and of itself, but there is a lot there. I think that yes, we filed a media, we saw the quotes in the press and all that stuff. We did see some very short term improvement on pricing at the end of mid to the end of August and even early this September. But it kind of has since, we’ve seen some softness again, some mild softness off of the high and so we are just tracking that as we look at it and see where it goes from a demand standpoint, if there is any improvement to holidays.  But when you talk about the other markets and I think the question your asking is what happens when you continue to shift. Is there a danger of over supplying the other market segments and while it’s hard to predict that the data set that hasn’t happened today and we don’t sense it and we don’t see it in the market at this point.  Mobile has been pretty stable despite the mix move and I think a lot of that is because the market probably didn’t have an appreciation six to nine months ago on what mobile densities will be doing and in fact you have seen tremendous growths not just in the low end, but across the SmartPhone segment on DRAM content.  So we don’t think its dramatic, we have very positive signs on industry supply, potentially slowing over the next year or so, but we got to wait and see how that comes out and checks out in terms of the market. But as far as demand, we are very upbeat as you’ve heard on the call today about some of the end market trends we are seeing and our ability to drive our technology there. It’s really a byproduct of this PC environment and again that rebounded and then create more balancing over all in the end markets. 
Mark Newman : Thanks and then on the cost side for DRAM, you obviously brought in, you pulled in your 20 nanometer RAM guidance during the Analyst Day. There wasn’t very much further comments in today’s call about it. I’m just wondering if there’s any latest and greatest comment about how that’s going and when are we going to actually start seeing cost declines from 20 nanometer shrink. 
Mark Durcan: Yes Mark. It’s still tracking pretty well with what we indicated at the Analyst Day, ahead of original plan and we like the way it’s going. We think you may start to see small impact in fiscal Q2, but really it’s a fiscal Q3 story. 
Mark Newman : All right, thanks very much. 
Ivan Donaldson: All right. We’d like to thank everyone for participating on the call today. If you please bear with me, I just need to repeat the Safe Harbor projection language.

D Mark Durcan: Thanks, Kipp. For our fiscal Q3 2015 Micron posted total revenue of $3.9 billion, within our revenue guidance of $3.8 billion to $4.05 billion. Revenue was sequentially lower as expected in fiscal Q3 due to near-term market headwinds, driven primarily by weakness in the PC sector. Net income was $491 million and earnings per share were $0.42. Non-GAAP net income was $620 million and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.54. Free cash flow was approximately $600 million, based upon operating cash flow and capital expenditures of approximately $1.3 billion and $730 million respectively. The team executed well in the challenging market conditions during Q3 as we supported our customers across a broad range of market segments. Micron is a memory company that produces technologically advanced components, systems and subsystems for the global marketplace. As such it’s important that regardless of near-term market conditions we remain focused on the long-term. We are continuing to deploy advanced process technology to enable leading edge products for our customers and to drive ongoing manufacturing efficiency for Micron.  Our customers are looking for a partner in memory system development who is capable of delivering advanced technology systems and solutions that are tuned to their product requirements and who will provide their products and their companies with a leading edge position in the marketplace. Today’s customers are also looking for ways to gain more innovation and efficiency in their own system design as memory has been deployed in more ways than ever previously imagined. From cloud servers to mobile infrastructure and automotive design to industrial and medical devices Micron memory is a preferred memory partner and is at the heart of technology product innovation. Turning to overall market conditions, we expect stabilizing DRAM ASPs across the broader market overtime, as we manage our product mix and distribute our capacity to a broad set of value added market segments. Consistent with prior expectations we are forecasting DRAM industry supply bit growth in the mid-20s in calendar 2015 and in the low to mid 20% in calendar 2016. We currently believe that DRAM demand in calendar 2015 in aggregate will be at or exceed supply. For NAND the market continues to consume planer NAND at increasing rates and we look forward to volume production of Micron’s differentiated high performance 3D NAND later this year. We expect NAND industry supply bit growth in the high 30% range this year and in the mid 30% range next year. We believe supply and demand are in balance this year and unconstrained demand is above supply in future periods based on currently known capacity plans. We are making good progress with fab expansion in Singapore. We expect the market will demand all of the 3D NAND output we can produce given the attractive cost and performance of our technology and the elastic storage market we will sell into. Advanced technology deployment requires focused investment and carefully managed transitions. To effectively execute next generation technology production at scale we are converting tools and systems today to allow for testing, samples and product qualification in the future. These activities drive future growth and margin expansion opportunities in our business, although they often limit short-term bit growth and cost reductions. We are continuing to make capital investments today to position ourselves for next generation production capabilities and for technology leadership. As always we will manage our capital to deliver long-term returns and shareholder value.  For today’s call I have asked Mark Adams to summarize our operational and BU results. I would also like to welcome Ernie Maddock, our recently appointed CFO. Ernie possesses outstanding industry experience, has hit the ground running and we are exciting to have him on the team. He will cover Q3 financials and Q4 guidance. I will return at the end of the prepared remarks with a quick summary and lead in the Q&A.
Mark Adams: Thank you, Mark. I will begin by providing an update on our key technology development initiatives, then review our DRAM and NAND businesses and conclude my portion of the call with commentary on each of our four business units. On the technology deployment front we remained focused on three major technology initiatives, completing the ramp up of our 25 nanometer DRAM technology, driving scale output of our 20 nanometer DRAM technology and the launching of our 3D NAND technology. We are currently shipping early production in 20 nanometer DRAM and will continue to ramp throughout the remainder of this year. We are expecting bit crossover in the first half of calendar 2016. We are still on track for low volume production 3D NAND in the second half of 2015, ramping to a significant percentage of our trade NAND supply in calendar 2016.  Now let me discuss our DRAM and NAND businesses. Let's begin with our DRAM business, which represents roughly 61% of our total revenue in fiscal Q3. We delivered DRAM solutions to a variety of market segments. While PC builds declined well below seasonally slow demand in the first half of the year, we saw relative stability in other end markets and responded to these conditions by adjusting our production mix throughout the quarter.  As a percent of DRAM revenue in fiscal Q3, mobile within the high 20% range, the PC segment was in the low 30% range, the server business was in the low 20% range and networking, graphics and AIMM comprised the remainder. We continue to move production from DDR3 to DDR4 to meet growing customer demand across our customer base for long-term more stable business.  Moving on to our NAND business; trade NAND revenue represented 32% of total revenue in fiscal Q3 and performance was consistent with our expectations. Our trade NAND bit growth was approximately flat due to mix shifts in favor of longer term design win opportunities for both Micron managed NAND and MCPs for Mobile and SSDs for our storage business. These products represent strong growth opportunities for us going forward.  As a percent of trade NAND revenue in fiscal Q3, consumer, which includes cards, USB and components, was in the mid-40% range. Mobile, including MCPs was in the low 20% range; SSDs were in the high teens. AIMM and other embedded markets combined are roughly mid-teens. We saw a 3% uptick in NAND component pricing in the quarter as we move more bits to our own SSD and mobile business and reduce the supply available to the transactional channel market.  We continue to better position our MLC portfolio to focus on strategic customers in higher performance segments. In fiscal Q3, these efforts reduced our MLC shipments into the existing TLC-enabled components channel by approximately 30%.  Moving onto our business units; CNBU, for our Computing and Networking Business Unit revenue was $1.5 billion in fiscal Q3 with operating income of $266 million. CNBU is impacted by lower ASPs driven by softness in demand from the PC segment. Consistent with our statements on the last earnings call we have reduced output targeted at the PC segments in favor of faster growing more stable segments. We expect better relative performance for PC builds in the second half of calendar year 2015 along with continued DRAM content growth, resulting in PC DRAM bit demands up slightly for the year.  CNBU enterprise customers continued their transition to DDR4 technology, including 8 gigabit DDR4 to support workloads that require both higher performance and higher density models. We continue to believe that applications such as in-memory database computing will drive substantial growth.  In the networking segment we see continued LTE deployments in emerging markets, which should represent additional opportunities as we move forward. Cloud server represents a high growth segment with analysts projecting 50% bit growth year-over-year. Growth in our graphics business was driven by sales in the game consoles and high performance graphics cards. This segment is transitioning to GDDR5.  We also commenced shipments of our first 20 nanometer graphics products. I mentioned our commencing 20 nanometers shipments earlier in my script. These initial products are primarily in support of CNBU, for example our compute customer in the PC segments.  Revenues in Micron’s storage business unit was $901 million in fiscal Q3, down 6% sequentially as we opportunistically shifted more NAND bits to higher margin businesses such as our mobile and embedded business units. Gross margins were up slightly in the quarter as we continue to focus on improving our storage business. Operating margins were slightly negative as we remained focused on investing for sustainable growth in this area.  Consistent with our stated strategy to improve Micron’s storage business we made good progress on key milestones in our third quarter. We announced availability of our new 16 nanometer TLC planer NAND components in fiscal Q3 and already have several channel customers buying our TLC, who will input them into SSDs, consumer drives, memory cards and other products, offering high density storage product to market based on this technology. Our SBU enterprise and data center businesses both grew 45% sequentially albeit from a lower base. We are pleased with the progress of our collaboration with Seagate and we will have our first SaaS SSD launch resulting from this partnership later in the summer. We have begun early sampling with customers and already have secured two qualification slots with major OEMs. And finally we released our own consumer SSD based on TLC NAND technology in the second half of 2015. We expect to have roughly 50% of our SDDs on TLC by the end of fiscal year 2016. Revenue in MBU, Mobile Business Unit was $938 million in fiscal Q3, up 10% sequentially. Operating income was $296 million or 32%, up from 31% in fiscal Q2. The mobile market supply demand balance remains healthy. Our mobile business continues to benefit from increasing content growth across the entire range of mobile products. 3 to 4 gigabyte phones announced at Mobile World Congress in March are now hitting the market. Low to mid-priced phones targeted at emerging markets are being built with significant memory content, including DRAM specs at 1 gigabyte and above.  We are also seeing a pull-in of next generation 4G LTE chipsets in reference designs that double the content of both DRAM and NAND from 2 gigabytes to 4 gigabytes of DRAM and from 8 and 16 gigabytes NAND to 16 and 32 gigabyte configurations. Micron continues joint validations for low power DDR4 across chipset platforms. LP4 adoption is currently limited to the very high end of the markets today but will be adopted more broadly in calendar 2016. Additionally the rapid adoption of eMCPs in the high growth mid-range market creates a significant opportunity for Micron as eMCPs will drive [ph] both low power DRAM and NAND, demonstrating the strength of our portfolio.  Micron’s embedded business unit posted revenues of $483 million with operating margins of 20%. Sales of our automotive-grade eMMC hit all-time high. We introduced our auto grade low power DDR4 in high performance G18 parallel NOR Flash devices in fiscal Q3. These products enable improved performance and power reduction for critical applications in high temperature rugged environments. EBU also experienced strong demand in the gaming business. Demand for high density 45 nanometer NOR Flash solutions are being driven by regulatory change in the Japanese gaming sector and we expect this elevated level of demand to continue. It’s also worthy to note that EBU shipments of NAND increased 27% from the prior quarter. Now to continue our commentary on fiscal Q3 results and Q4 guidance I will turn the call over to Ernie.
Ernie Maddock: Thanks Mark. It’s a pleasure to be joining the Micron team and I look forward to meeting many of you at our upcoming Analyst Day in August. The third quarter of fiscal 2015 ended on June 4th and the results include net income of $491 million or $0.42 per share on net sales of $3.9 billion and gross margin of 31%. Aside from our recurring items non-GAAP adjustments include an additional provision for income taxes relating to a tax rate change in Japan that resulted in a reduction in the value of the deferred tax asset from MMJ operations. So non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $620 million or $0.54 a share. Let’s turn to results by product line starting with DRAM; DRAM revenue decreased approximately 13% compared to the second quarter, reflecting approximately a 10% decrease in per bit average selling prices and relatively flat sales volumes. DRAM gross margin was in the upper 30s range as cost per bit decreased approximately 6%. As was previously noted we adjusted our output mix during the quarter and excited with relatively flat DRAM inventory levels.  On the trade NAND side which includes our growing MCP business, revenue increased approximately 3% in the third quarter with average selling prices increasing approximately 6%, partially offset by a slight decrease in sales volume. The increase in the trade NAND average selling price was mix related as higher ASP units grew relatively faster than the overall average. Trade NAND gross margin improved slightly compared to the prior quarter and was in the low 20% range as the increase in mix related ASP exceeded the higher related cost.  The company generated operating cash flow of $1.3 billion during the third quarter and ended the quarter with $7.3 billion in cash and marketable investments. During the third quarter we received $1 billion in proceeds from the issuance of high yield notes and we deployed $782 million to repurchase a portion of the outstanding series C and D convertible notes. Cash expenditures for property plans and equipment during the first three quarters were $2.3 billion and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be within our previously forecasted FY '15 range of $3.6 billion to $4 billion.  SG&A expense for the quarter was below our guided range as a result of lower legal cost while research and development expense was above our guided range primarily due to higher volumes of wafers used for development of new products and technologies.  Now looking to guidance for the fourth quarter; DRAM gross margins for the fourth quarter using quarter-to-date ASP and projected mix for the quarter should be down mid-single digits compared to the third quarter based on bit production flat to slightly up while average selling prices are going -- will be down mid to high-single digits and cost per bit up low-single digits. Key items affecting our DRAM guidance for the fourth quarter include the continued effects of higher mix of mobile and DDR4 products, which have larger die sizes and therefore produce fewer bits per wafer.  Fiscal Q4 quarter-to-date mix adjusted ASP is below the third quarter average, due primarily to reductions in PC-DRAM and cloud server ASPs. Pricing in mobile and specialty DRAM remains relatively stable. We have and will continue to carefully balance output volumes between our end markets. The trade NAND gross margins for the fourth quarter using quarter-to-date average ASP and projected mix for the quarter are expected to be flat compared to the third quarter, based on bit production down low to mid-single digits while ASPs are relatively stable and cost per bit is approximately flat.  Key trends for the fourth quarter affecting this guidance are, like-for-like pricing down slightly offset by average selling price improvements on changes in mix and continued focus on mobile and managed NAND products. These products generally have both higher ASPs and cost. On a consolidated basis we are guiding total revenue for the fourth quarter in the range of $3.45 billion to $3.7 billion.  Looking at other P&L and cash flow results and guidance, SG&A spending in the fourth quarter is expected to be in the range of $180 million with research and development expense in the range of $400 million. For non-GAAP guidance for fourth quarter please refer to the dilution table posted along with other materials for this call on our website. The dilution table reflects the anti-dilutive effects of our cap calls at various stock prices.  Now I'll turn it back over to Mark Durcan.
D Mark Durcan: Thanks Ernie. In summary I believe Micron executed well in fiscal Q3 as we supported our customers across a broad range of market segments. We expect to continue to similarly navigate changing market conditions in fiscal Q4. Micron is executing on key milestones in technology deployment and product introductions we believe strongly in the future of the industry and our company.  Operator I think we're ready to begin Q&A. 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. DRAM revenue bit shipments were down slightly quarter-on-quarter. Can you just tell us what your bit production growth was? I think you said you didn't build any inventory. Also I think you previously talked about high-single digits production shipment growth over the next couple of quarters, but the main quarter results and the August quarter guidance certainly doesn’t seem to be suggesting this. So is the Micron team still targeting bit shipment growth in the mid-teens range this year? 
D Mark Durcan: This is Mark Durcan. Maybe I'll start with the last part of that question and then Mark Adams can comment a little bit on the mix effects and what happened with DRAM sales bit. So for 2015 I think it's still fair to say that had we not had mix adjustments as we move through the year we would still be driving to a high teens number for DRAM bit growth. But obviously the number for the year is now going to be less than that given the changes we made as we moved through the year. As we think forward over the longer term and clearly we said in the past and we continue to reiterate that we will be higher than market as we move through calendar 2016.  On the NAND front, we've been less than market in 2015 and we're still evaluating exactly what our capital plans look like for 2016 and we'll dial those based on market conditions as well as ongoing evaluation of the technology introductions in Singapore relative to the 3D NAND and deployment of other advanced technologies there.  Mark if you want to take the DRAM sales bit and the mix effect that drove that, maybe that's the best approach. 
Mark Adams: Sure, we’ve said all along that we will obviously take in the market dynamics into play as we think about how we allocate our capacity, and given some of the headwinds in the PC market we re-directed some of that capacity to either more strategic long-term markets such as the DDR4, and then some of the PC new bits just to more attractive long-term stable markets. A good example of that would be cloud servers, another example would be our mobile business. And we think that was the right thing to do but they do have a lowering effect on the bit growth. 
Harlan Sur: Okay, great. And then just my follow up question on the NAND front. So I think team is starting to make the move to 16 nanometer TLC, you are driving some production of 3D, obviously that will be a bigger part of the mix in the second half of this year and next year. But the team is still looking for decline in production growth in the August quarter. What's your sense on when we should expect bit production to start to inflect higher for your NAND business? 
D Mark Durcan: Well, again that's going to depend on the details of the mix decisions we make. What's been going on here over the last quarter or two is that as we transition to higher percent of SSD sales we build width. And so the time the product takes through the line increases and that creates a dip over a confined period of time as we build out width. Mobile is a similar type of effect as some of that output goes out in MCPs as well. So I think that the larger question is exactly when will we see NAND bit growth? I think you will see that emerge as we move through the next number of quarters. 
Harlan Sur: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura. 
Romit Shah: Yes, thank you. Mark you mentioned that for this year your expectation is that DRAM demand will exceed supply, but ASPs year-to-date in DRAM are clearly worse than expectations. How do we reconcile that? 
D Mark Durcan: Yeah, what I tried to indicate is that I think in aggregate for the year the demand is going to exceed the supply, which I think your takeaway from that would be that we believe that demand is going to be higher in the back half of the year as we said on the last call, and as we continue to believe. And so that as we cume that up over the entire year you will come to the conclusion that the growth that we continue to see in some of the other markets, mobile, datacenter, enterprise server et cetera, and networking will offset what's been a slow PC period.  Even PCs I think, our view is that by the time we get to the end of the year notwithstanding the decrease in unit sales, there will be a small net growth in bits into the PC segment. 
Romit Shah: I guess what I'm alluding to is that if you look at the ASP trend over the last few periods and your DRAM bit growth relative to peers, I'm just curious to what extent do you believe that the industry is still being rational. 
D Mark Durcan: Well, I think it's fair to say that probably nobody expected the PC segment to be as slow as it’s been. And I think it’s also reasonable to expect that in an industry with a number of high growth segments balancing supply and demand is never going to be precise. And so ripples in the relative balance of supply and demand I believe are inevitable in a market like this and what I would say is that probably supply got a little bit further ahead of demand than many of us anticipated but that it’s not necessarily an indicator of a deliberate strategy by any particular player in the marketplace.
Romit Shah: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for taking my question. I want to go back to a prior question. In that context when we go back to when industry consolidated we all expected that mobile and servers are going to be more of a secular growth driver and these two segments obviously carry a [die penalty] [ph]. Given the consolidated industry why is that industry more proactively seeking higher margin. If there is a mix issue in the near-term, it seems to me that these headwinds are more structural since the demand drivers are actually in the mobile and server. So wonder if you can help us better understand how the industry is going to overcome this, especially as migration to sub 20 nanometer is going to be relatively more challenging and lengthier and in that context how are you going to be able to manage margins? And I have a follow-up.
D Mark Durcan: I think the answer to that question is that in an undersupplied market, as we had a number of quarters ago, you tend to get margins that are higher in maybe the least attractive long-term part of the market. And so if you think about where PC margins were, they were higher than we were experiencing in both mobile and in server, primarily because suppliers view those as long-term least attractive and a market that was maybe less sustainable. And therefore you see larger price swings as the relative supply and demand balance moves over time. Now as you think about what does that imply, that implies that as companies like Micron and presumably our competitors over time readjust their supply to rebalance demand in different segments and pull supply out of that sector it creates an ASP headwind for us because we are moving to products that already have lower margin and it creates over the short-term more intense competition for those sockets in the high growth sectors. That doesn’t say anything really about what will happen over the longer time horizon.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay, and I am still not sure how are you going to be able to recoup these near-term margin headwind, is that as is more of a scaling and I am still confused, how the near-term margin pressure is going to -- you are going to be able to overcome it and be able to better manage margins?
D Mark Durcan: Well, I think I believe overtime that there is -- in some of these other market segments there is opportunity to differentiate and to innovate and to provide stickier solutions. There is also a higher growth and longer qualification cycle. So what a company like Micron does is they look at -- and I think Mark kind of already alluded to this but I will restate it anyway, we’re looking to place our product, not necessarily in the short-term to pick up the highest margin point but to make sure we are placing our product where we're going to have growth and stability and where overtime we can drive higher margins. And so sometimes you want to be a little bit proactive and out front of that. 
Mehdi Hosseini: Got it, and then quickly on NAND. Right now your trends are to build the pilot line, this 3D NAND pilot line in Singapore and then, what -- 48 layer that samples are coming out. And then my impression is that you're going to add production capacity in Singapore. But your FLASH partner Intel is also very upbeat about the 3D NAND and technology and how they're also going to use that technology. So when we look into next year and beyond, how is this relationship going to work, because the JVs are in -- the JV fabs are located in U.S. but you're initially going to ramp the capacity in Singapore. How will this -- how will the transaction going to play out and when would you actually finish adding capacities in the JV locations? 
D Mark Durcan: So let me correct a couple of things you said, just to make sure we are clear on what we're doing and then I'll -- maybe have a couple of comments on the Intel relationship. But I think that’s something that's better done by two of us as opposed to just Micron.  So first of all, relative to what we are doing today, we have as you know a significant installed planar base in Singapore. We have available clean room space there to begin the process of converting some of that planar capacity to 3D NAND, and we're under construction of an expansion in that facility so that we can continue that transition of planar NAND to 3D NAND into the back half of 2016 and on beyond that.  There is also capacity that Micron and Intel own jointly in Lehi, Utah and today you're correct that is all planar NAND capacity. So one other thing, I think you said 48 layers. We are currently sampling a 32 layer 3D NAND device and that is the device that we will initially ramp before moving to a second generation of 3D device starting in the back half of 2016.  Now relative to Micron's and Intel's plans for production, there is not a whole lot I can say about that today, other than to say it continues to be a very close partnership. We continue to develop the 3D NAND technology together and we have existing long-term supply agreements with Intel to support planar NAND and we anticipate that we will build 3D NAND for them as well through an agreement out of Singapore. And that's probably all I can say, absent an agreement with Intel to share more information with you. 
Mehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thanks so very much. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy from Stifel.
Kevin Cassidy: Thanks for taking my question. On the transition or moving your capacity away from PC-DRAM towards more strategic DRAM, where are you with that? Have you stopped the transition and what percentage do you think the split will be in the August quarter and going into the November quarter?
D Mark Durcan: Well I’m going to stop short of giving you accurate actual numbers on allocation of our capacity for variety of reasons. But I will tell you that the process is in place. You can see some of the growth we've had in certain sectors as we reported that. And so it's in process. Mobile, overall growth rate from a segment demand standpoint is up 50% and PC bits are low-single digits, 5% range. So as we think about that shift we are making it has to respond to that. And we're on that path. As we said we started in Q3 and we'll continue to balance that out as the market warrant. 
Kevin Cassidy: And maybe just as a follow-up, the visibility you have into mobile and there is some concern in the market that you could overshoot and end up with too much capacity in mobile. Can you talk more about some of your visibility into the mobile market?
D Mark Durcan: So I think we talked a few things. As I mentioned in my script we've actually seen continued growth in content per device. We see that while some people have noticed that the China market starting to mature somewhat, we are starting to see more growth out of India and emerging markets. So in general our visibility is pretty good with the level of configurations, both in the mid-range smartphone market. I think those unit growth -- there is something around 90% unit growth for the year and the bit growth rate. So our visibility supports the moving -- as our capacity covers that and I think the results of our MBU further reinforces that.
Kevin Cassidy: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Daniel Amir from Ladenburg.
Daniel Amir: Thanks a lot. So if we look at the Inotera deal from seven-eight months ago, when you talked about it, you commented that at that time, if pricing would be the same would be significantly accretive. How would we look at the deal right now in terms of the pricing at the moment and do you think something is going to change there in the next six months? Thanks.
D Mark Durcan: Obviously at lower pricing the accretion from the new deal, which will begin in the beginning of calendar 2016 will be less than it would have been had pricing been flat. We never assumed pricing would be flat throughout 2016. So I think the net takeaway is that there is less accretion from the new deal than there was on the day we signed it. It’s still reasonable to talk in terms of the types of numbers that we talked about when we first introduced the new agreement to you.
Daniel Amir: So it’s still accretive at pricing that we are looking at today or is that not the case?
D Mark Durcan: Absolutely true, yes.
Daniel Amir: Okay. All right and just a follow-up here in terms of the factors here for your NAND cost going forward, I mean should we view really, is it really the TLC mix, is it more of the product mix, I mean what should we be looking at and when you said that you should start seeing in the next few quarters what are really the milestones that we are looking at, that this will really start impacting?
Mark Adams: I think at the risk of repeating our story on NAND, I think that we’ve already demonstrated substantial growth in the mobile NAND segment and our TLC component shipping in Q3 will be the catalyst for our future growth there. As a follow on we have a consumer TLC drive coming out in the Q1 of our fiscal year. And so when you look at those dynamics coupled with the vertical NAND enterprise progress we are making, we feel that those are still the pillars to our success in improving our operating performance in the overall NAND business.
Daniel Amir: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest.
Monika Garg: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Mark you were talking about like move from PC DRAM to mobile DRAM has been headwind to the margins. So are the margins now similar in PC DRAM and mobile DRAM or is the move still a headwind?
Mark Adams: Sure. Hey Monika, this is Mark Adams. The margins are getting closer and we always run the risk of trying to explain that through the past 90 days and what’s happened [ph]. At the beginning of the quarter they were certainly further away from each other and today they are approaching each other.
Monika Garg: Okay, thanks. Then one question on the NAND side, the SBU operating margins be negative for this quarter and last quarter. You have talked about move to TLC and you also talked about that pricing is benign in the market. So when can we see SBU margins to move higher in the positive territory?
D Mark Durcan: Well I think you will see that overtime, Monika but don’t forget our NAND business is actually segregated across the Bus. So we sell NAND not only through the SBU but there is a significant piece as Mark Adams just mentioned going out of mobile space. We also said there is significant growth in the embedded space for NAND, and then there is a sort of a counter factor, I guess that you should always be cognizant of, that we sell to Intel through the NAND BU and sometimes that’s -- there are lots of facets to our relationship with Intel that have benefits to us, that aren’t always about selling to them at the highest ASP.
Monika Garg: Got it, thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from Cowen and Company. 
Timothy Arcuri : Thanks so much. I also have two questions. First of all, did you say costs are being guided up low singles? And I get the mix issues that you cited with mobile and DDR4. But it still seems a little odd given that Inotera’s roughly one-third of the bits and that’s still based on market minus [ph]. So is there something behind the scene happening with costs and then I had a follow-up thanks?
Mark Adams: The real answer to that is there’s nothing behind the scenes other than what normally happens in our industry on startup. And you've got some parallel startup tasks that are influencing cost along with the mix effect that you mentioned in mobile. But you've got DDR4 ramp cost and in parallel you got 20 nanometer startup cost that when blended are providing a little bit of a cost headwind in the short term. 
Timothy Arcuri : Okay, thanks. And then just a quick question on CapEx. To hit your full $3.8 billion midpoint the CapEx has to be like 1.5, 1.6 just in August which would be like a $6 billion annual run rate heading in fiscal 2016. How should we think about that? Is that like an anomaly in August or should we think about that as being close to what the right run-rate is as you look into fiscal 2016?
Ernie Maddock: Tim, this is Ernie. We, as we've said earlier we've been looking at CapEx very carefully as we respond to market conditions and obviously we still feel that range of -- in the $4 billion or so range for this year makes sense. I wouldn't necessarily imply or project that forward as a run-rate into 2016. We're still in the process of working through our plans. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse from Evercore ISI. 
CJ Muse: Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, first question I was hoping you could dig a little bit deeper on the 20 nanometer ramp, both at Inotera and internally. And you're really focused on when you expect to be cost competitive with Samsung and Hynix. And then as a follow on to that your plans for 1X and your ability to reduce Samsung's time to market advantage, would love to hear your thoughts. 
D Mark Durcan: Yeah, so first of all, I think the best way to characterize the state of our 20 nanometer deployment today is we're running at relatively low volumes, but it's going really very, very well. We're -- we've got low volume but we're driving fast cycle time through the fab. The run head [ph] lots and the yields are progressing fabulously. And we feel pretty good about the way that ramp’s going both at Inotera and in Hiroshima. So of course as we just said the costs are higher. It takes a while to work through that now because you're driving [indiscernible] up but also because at low volume you don't have fully loaded tools and you have a lot of tools that you're installing and you haven’t managed the load yet. And that process is going to take a while, until we are really driving through significant volume.  Now the way to think about that is in terms of bit crossover. And we think that we'll have bit crossover, 20 nanometer versus the other nodes in the first half of calendar 2016 and that's probably about as precise as I would want to be about that.  Now for 1X, we think that as we closed the Elpida transaction we added significant technology development resources to our team. We've been running at a higher R&D spend as we ran more resources deployed on multiple technology nodes and the 1X node will be the first one that comes out as a result of both those teams working together. So yes, we expect to close that gap relative to Samsung. It's not going to necessarily be directly on top of it.  But remember what Micron’s doing right now is that we're converting a lot of capacity from 30 nanometer to 20 nanometer, which is a double step. And so we're going to get a big bang for that as we move throughout 2016. Step two, to 60 nanometer, smaller to begin with, in particular if you’ve looked at some of the early Samsung samples that are floating around. You will notice that the architecture changes that they've incorporated don't drive nearly the size of die reduction or the bit density increase that you would see going from even 25 nanometer to 30.  So we absolutely expect to close the gap with Samsung as we move to 16 nanometer, both in timing and in terms of overall deployed bit density in the market.
CJ Muse: That’s very helpful. I guess as my follow-up can you talk about, within your outlook for DRAM pricing, down to mid to high single digits, what you are assuming on the mobile side and if you can comment at all on your positioning within tier 1 handsets into the back half of the year, would love to hear your thoughts?
D Mark Durcan: Again we don’t want to -- we don’t get into business of forecasting pricing too much. Generally what I would say characteristic of the mobile business is that it doesn’t exactly behave like PC business. That tends to be more of a design win type business, you design into a device or platform that has long lasting life cycles relative to interchangeability of PC modules. And in light of that it behaves a little bit more like a predictable pricing model where there is a sale price and a cost reduction target over through a longer period, maybe six months, maybe 12 months. And so the pricing behavior in mobile is somewhat different and we anticipate that to be similar going forward and it’s reflective of our current mobile performance.
CJ Muse: And so it’s fair to characterize mobile declining less than PC?
D Mark Durcan: I think that’s fair.
CJ Muse: Okay, great, thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer : Yeah good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. I guess I want to go back to the question that Tim Arcuri asked earlier just about DRAM cost per bit going up. I would have thought that given that third of your bits come from Inotera and that’s based upon market pricing and arrears that the price declines we’ve seen over the last three months would be a big sort of tailwind to cost for you guys in the August quarter, and I guess that’s wrong. I guess I am trying to understand why that’s wrong and more importantly as you think about the headwinds on the cost side in DRAM in the August quarter do they begin to reverse in the November quarter or how do we start to think about kind of the cost curve in DRAM going back down instead of up?
D Mark Durcan: Let me take the first part and then we will have you restate the second part. Relative to IMI bits we are early in the ramp. So there is not a lot of upsurge in IMI bits yet. But it is coming. And I think the effect will be, as you say with more volume at any given price we are going to get a larger dollar discount, not necessarily a larger percentage discount. So as we move through the rest of 2015 you do have to contemplate that the discount at IMI is also a function of their cash flow and that stands apart and aside from the effect of market pricing. You also have to contemplate that at lower market pricing, a given fixed percent discount is a smaller dollar discount. So all those things kind of go in the hopper, John. I’m not sure exactly how you are doing your calculus but those are all effects.  We will, obviously as the 20 nanometer becomes a more significant piece of their output, hopefully see an increase in revenue and an increase in total dollar discount as that happens.
John Pitzer : And Mark maybe just to restate the second half of the question was, beyond the August quarter if all else being equal given the ramps that are causing headwinds in the August quarter would you expect cost per bits in DRAM to start trending down or do we really have to wait until you get to that big crossover at 20 nanometer you had talked about earlier?
D Mark Durcan: I think it’s going to depend a lot on mix. Unfortunately I hate to say that but we still got -- we’ve got ongoing DDR4 which drives costs up given the bit density per square centimeter. So we’ve got LPDDR4, we’ve got mobile DRAM and server DRAM, all of which can drive higher costs, but like-for-like, fair to say yeah cost are going to be coming down, as we get a little bit further in those 20 nanometer transition.
John Pitzer : And then for my second question, just to Mark Adams. Mark, just given some of these headwinds in the August quarter it seems like the P&L is more dependent upon just overall pricing and you made some commentary about PC production being below kind of seasonally weak sell through for the market and you expect that to reverse I am just kind of curious why what’s the catalyst. And important can you talk a little bit about inventory outside of Micron relative to PC-DRAM. 
Mark Adams: Sure, let me -- the comments on the PC business were kind through our Q3 relative to the performance. We do feel that whether it be Microsoft Windows 10 or Skylight or other Intel roadmap benefits from PC and pent-up demand. We just think it should be moderately better than in the first half and that's had the better effect on the overall market than in the first half of the year. So we think PC should perform better in the second half.  Relative to the DRAM side and the mix shifting away from PCs we think that combination leads to more stability in the pricing in the back half of the year. Now you asked about the channel, it's kind of initial dynamic [ph]. By and large the OEMs and major suppliers to OEM, there is one channel partner is heavily investing a lot of inventory. Having said that a number of [indiscernible] suppliers are pretty little -- actually seasonably lower than what we say the three to four week normal inventory levels. And so as these things improve and there is balance we don’t think it takes a lot to get more bounce back into the compute segment and which should have a very positive effect in the overall business. 
John Pitzer : Thank you. 
D Mark Durcan: And with that I think we have time for about one more question. 
Operator: Thank you and our final question for today comes from the line of Steven Fox from Cross Research.
Steven Fox: Thanks, good afternoon. Hopefully this isn't too repetitive, but just going back on the DRAM gross margins from a different bit. I understand what you're saying about cost per bit with the mix changing. But also as the mix changes beyond the August quarter, shouldn't we expect some sort of rebound in DRAM margins and to what degree? And -- or are we looking at more of a drag from a 20 nanometer ramp? And then within that answer can you just maybe talk a little bit more about DDR4 and how it's going to ramp on the mobile side thanks. 
D Mark Durcan: So we really want to stay away again from predicting margins for you. But I think it's fair to say that assuming market dynamics improve we've got -- we've got, all else equal we've got cost leverage. 
Steven Fox: Fair enough. And how about just a little more color on DDR4 as it relates to mobile. 
D Mark Durcan: I think LPDDR4 -- I think as I said in my script it's currently a relatively a small percentage of overall bits into the mobile sector. We do see that changing out towards the end of calendar year '15 and into '16, today low power fours [ph] in the ultra-high end. At least what we -- obviously we're very well positioned in those relationships. It’s just a small piece of the overall next today and we think that will grow and we got a technology and our in design qualifications at these OEMs for that type of success in that product category. 
Steven Fox: Great, thank you very much.

Mark Durcan: Thanks, Kipp. I am pleased with our team’s performance this quarter. Our diverse product portfolio and balanced customer base produced solid financial results. Revenue was within our guidance at $4.2 billion and GAAP net income was $934 million or $0.78 per share. Gross margins in DRAM and trade NAND were in line or better than guidance. Importantly, we are starting to see the early benefits of our NAND product and technology repositioning. Free cash flow was approximately 400 million in the second fiscal quarter based on operating cash flow of 1.25 billion, plus CapEx of 853 million. We finished the quarter with $6.35 billion of cash and short-term investments after successful execution of $1 billion straight debt offering. We remain very positive on the long-term prospects for our business despite short-term headwinds in certain segments. We expect to continue generating strong operating cash flow as we optimize technology, operations, product and segment mix. Micron’s fiscal Q3 guidance is $3.8 billion to $4.05 billion. The midpoint of the range is about 6% lower than revenue in Q2. This guidance indicates the willingness to hold inventory if needed. Let me talk a little bit more about technology. Today the significant majority of our mobile DRAM and non-Inotera production is on 25 nanometers. Our advanced DRAM technology deployment is going very smoothly. The 20 nanometer yield ramp is exceeding both our plan and results achieved on previous process node introductions. We continue to expect commercial volume in the second half of 2015 with the majority of our DRAM bits on 20 nanometer in the first half of calendar year 2016, 1X nanometer DRAM development is also proceeding well and we recently started the early silicon in Hiroshima. We’re currently in pilot production of our gen 1 32 layers 3D NAND with early sampling in progress. We expect to be in full production of both MLC and TLC versions by calendar Q4 of this year with system level solutions following soon thereafter. 3D will be a meaningful percentage of our trade NAND supply in calendar 2016 and will represent a majority of our bits during 2017. Our gen 2 3D NAND technology is progressing nicely in R&D.  Turning now to bit growth, we expect our calendar year 2015 DRAM bits produced to be up mid-teens although product mix adjustments including an increased mix of DDR4 and mobile DRAM could impact bit growth. Mix adjustment decisions are based on margin optimization and strategic positioning and are not necessarily aligned with maximizing bit growth. In 2015 we’re focused on technology enablement and we’re comfortable growing bits below the market in the near-term in favor of driving long-term market opportunities for Micron. For 2016 as we see the benefit of 20 nanometer conversions we expect to be in line with or slightly above the industry bit growth. We expect our trade NAND bit growth to be below marketing calendar ’15 as we tune our product portfolio to more value-added applications and prepare for a 3D manufacturing ramp throughout 2016. Once complete our Singapore fab expansion and ongoing conversion of existing planar capacity to 3D NAND could support 40% to 50% bit growth per annum over an extended time horizon. The exact timing of these investments is dependent on market conditions and the expected ROIC but this is an exciting initiative for the company. With respect to capital allocation we continue to believe in long-term value of investment in our business to drive manufacturing efficiencies and future growth. We also continue to prioritize appropriate investments in R&D including memory sub-systems and systems development and manufacturing capacity. We’re actively managing our cash balances including the deployment of $2.8 billion over the past six quarters to reduce dilution associated with convertible debt. We also repurchased approximately $200 million of common stock in fiscal Q2 under an existing $1 billion stock repurchase program. Now for an update on our finance team, we have a number of outstanding CFO candidates under consideration and are working to identify the best fit for Micron. While we work through that process the finance team is reporting to Mark Adams as Interim CFO. Our finance leadership team has decades of collective experience at Micron and other leading semiconductor companies. The team includes among others Mark Heil Micron’s long time Controller and current Interim Principal Financial Accounting Officer. I have asked Mark to cover the financial portions of our prepared remarks today. Before I turn the call over to rest of the team I would like to reiterate that there are a number of significant factors that we believe will deliver growth, margin improvement and strong financial results for Micron towards the end of 2015 and heading into fiscal 2016. Among other things these include 20 nanometer DRAM, 16 nanometer TLC NAND, 3D NAND, mobile NAND, eMCPs, enterprise SSDs, and the Inotera contract change. I’ll stop here and turn it over to Mark Heil and Mark Adams before turning for Q&A.
Mark Heil: Thanks Mark. The second quarter of fiscal 2015 ended on March 5th. When comparing the Q2 results to the first quarter recall that the first quarter was a 14 week period rather than our normal 13 week period. The results for the second quarter include net income of $934 million or $0.78 per share on net sales of 4.166 billion; gross margins came in at 34%. Our reported income from equity method investments for the second quarter was $208 million substantially all of which was attributable to Inotera. Our share of Inotera’s results includes a benefit of 65 million from their release of a valuation allowance on their deferred tax assets that was reflected in their December 31, 2014 year-end results. Aside from recurring items the benefit from Inotera’s tax adjustment is the only other noteworthy non-GAAP adjustment this quarter. So non-GAAP income for the second quarter was $941 million or $0.81 per share. Relating to our non-GAAP guidance for the third quarter please refer to the dilution table that’s posted along with the other materials for this call on our Web site. The dilution table reflects the anti-dilutive effects of our capped calls at various assumed stock prices. Looking at the results and other guidance for the third quarter by product line let’s start first with DRAM. DRAM revenue decreased 13% compared to the first quarter reflecting a 9% decrease in bit sales volume and a 6% decrease in average selling prices. Lower bit sales were largely attributable to the extra week in fiscal Q1. DRAM gross margin was better than anticipated being stable comparing Q1 to Q2 as bit cost decreases nearly offset decreases in selling prices. DRAM gross margins for the third quarter using quarter-to-date ASPM projected mix for the quarter should be down compared to Q2 based on bit sales that are guided to be flat, average selling prices down high single-digits and cost per bit down low single-digits. Key items affecting our DRAM guidance for the third quarter include bit production up high single-digits over each of the next couple of quarters as 25 nanometer yields continue to improve. This increase is net of anticipated affects of increased mix of mobile and DDR-4 products which generally have lower bit densities. Our sales guidance anticipates taking strategic action to reduce PC DRAM sales this quarter given the recent demand and price weakness. Therefore we’re guiding bit sales to be flat for the quarter. We believe the PC DRAM segment will show improvement in the second half of the calendar year based on the stabilizing demand profile. Fiscal Q3 to-date mix adjusted ASP is below the second quarter average due to pricing pressure in PC DRAM over the past several months and a high volume of products sold in die form. On the trade NAND side revenue increased 3% in the second quarter with a 12% increase in bit sales volume, partially offset by a 9% decrease in the average selling price. Trade NAND gross margin declined to the low 20% range as cost reductions per bit only partially offset decreases in selling prices. Trade NAND gross margins for the third quarter using quarter-to-date ASP and projected mix for the quarter are expected to be relatively stable compared to Q2 based on bit production down low single-digits, ASPs up single-digits primary from a higher mix of mobile products and cost per bit up mid single-digits also primarily on mix. Key trends for the third quarter affecting the guidance are like-for-like pricing relatively flat, relatively stable component and client SSD markets, lower bit sales into the component spot market which had a negative effect on bit growth and cost per bit but improving effect on average selling prices. And finally continued focus on mobile and managed NAND products which has an improving effect on margin with increases both in ASP and cost per bit. On a consolidated basis, we’re guiding total revenue for the third quarter to be in the range of 3.8 billion to 4.05 billion. Looking at other P&L and cash flow results and guidance, SG&A is expected to be relatively stable over the next several quarters in the 180 million to 190 million range. Research and development expense in the second quarter was just below our guided range primarily due to a lower volume of wafers used for development. We expect R&D expense to trend up slightly over the next couple of quarters in line with development activities. The Company generated operating cash flow in the second quarter of 1.25 billion and ended the quarter with 6.35 billion in cash and marketable investments. During the second quarter we received $1 billion in proceeds from the issuance of high yield notes our first successful offering of straight debt with near investment grade terms. We anticipate utilizing proceeds to repurchase or convert outstanding convertible notes and other debt and for other general corporate purposes. We also replaced our $255 million Singapore-based AR backed credit line with the $750 million line no amounts have yet been drawn under that facility. The second instalment on the Elpida creditor’s debt of approximately US$150 million was paid during the second quarter. We also repurchased 6.5 million shares for $192 million under the Board authorized $1 billion share buyback program. Expenditures for property, plant and equipment year-to-date are 1.5 billion and we continue to expect expenditures for the fiscal year to be between $3.6 billion and $4 billion with the stepped up level of spending in the latter half of the fiscal year as we execute on 20 nanometer DRAM and commence 3D NAND investments. Now, I’ll turn it over to Mark Adams for his comments on the operating results.
Mark Adams: Thanks Mark. Good afternoon and thanks for joining our call. I am going to change my format a little today and begin by providing some thoughts around both our DRAM and NAND business and the respective markets followed by a deeper dive into our business units. Fiscal Q2 showed some seasonal weakness which is not uncommon coming out of the holidays considering the timing of Chinese New Year is within our quarter I was pleased with our operating performance. The strength of our diverse product portfolio contributed to relatively stable gross margins quarter-on-quarter. We saw some pricing pressure in the PC segment, but generally all other market demand remained healthy. DRAM represented 65% of our total revenue in Q2. As a percent of that DRAM revenue mobile represented mid-20% similar to Q1, the PC segment represented low-30% down from mid-30% from prior quarter and server business was about low-20% up a few percentage points, while networking, AIMM and graphics were each below 10% similar to the Q1 mix. We are allocating less production to the PC segment and continuing to shift more bit stores towards the other faster growing segments. We also continue to move production from DDR-3 to DDR-4 as our customer demand grows. Although these manufacturing move generally weigh on production bit output guidance, our DRAM process transitions will more than make up for the bit and wafer effect as a result we are guiding to high single-digit sequential output growth for each of the next couple of quarters. Our DRAM team is executing through key technology transitions over our second half. We’re driving expanded 25 nanometer production and preparing for second half calendar year ’15 conversion to 20 nanometer across our fab network. DRAM technology enablement remains a key focus for our teams. We are pleased with the market acceptance of our DDR4 technology as major OEMs are adopting Micron’s products for their value-added segments. We are qualified across all Intel server platforms and we’re seeing very strong demand signals for our 8 gigabit DDR4 products and in particular from the enterprise server and networking customer base. DDR4 ASPs remain at a premium to DDR3. The NAND market has gone through some challenging quarters of late, but we’ve seen signs that the market pricing has stabilized. As a percentage of total revenue trade NAND represented 29% with gross margins down slightly quarter-on-quarter as we guided during our first quarter call. Within trade NAND, the sales components represented about 50% in the second quarter. SSD units approximately 20%, our mobile NAND was roughly low teens while AIMM and other embedded were roughly in the mid single-digit percentages. We continue to leverage our industry leading MLC NAND flash in key segments that demand higher performance. We’re significantly reducing our NAND supply to the spot market down 30% quarter-over-quarter and as a result our trade NAND bit growth in the coming quarters will be limited. Working with our partner Intel, we recently showcased our new 3D vertical NAND technology an innovative manufacturing approach that extends more large trajectory for flash storage cost and performance. Micron’s high density 3D NAND flash devices will enable small form vector drives with 1 terabyte of storage and standard 2.5 SSDs with greater than 10 terabytes of storage. We expect the improved performance of Micron 3D NAND technology to open up expanded segment opportunities. We plan to commence early 3D production in the second half of the calendar year. Our 16 nanometer TLC product is coming along nicely and we are on-track for initial component shipment in late May, early June. And moving onto our business unit discussion, in our Computing and Networking Business Unit, referred to as CNBU, our revenue was 1.8 billion in fiscal Q2. The PC notebook business saw a reduced demand and pricing pressure, yet turned in operating profit up only slightly at 27%. Interestingly, customers took forecasted delivery which we interpreted to be generally positive as it pertains to overall channel inventory and future shipments. We saw continued growth in our server business driven by cloud computing and enterprise. Server DRAM bit growth is forecasted up roughly 40% year-on-year in 2015. The growth in server memory is based on increasing server workloads that require a high DRAM performance and density. We continue to invest in expansion of our server business, as this segment offers a growth demand profile that is less sensitive to price fluctuations. The Networking segment delivered strong gross margins while achieving flat revenue quarter-over-quarter despite ASP pressure in the broader DRAM market. Demand remained stable driven by LTE build out in the emerging markets. Demand for DRAM supply in growing data communications, video and gaming content is estimated at roughly 20% in calendar year 2015. We believe this will drive higher demand for Micron’s memory products and networking going forward next year. Our Graphics business led by DDR5 is another growing specialty DRAM market for Micron. Last year Capital doubled their memory content per system and there will be additional content growth this year as the use of these devices continues to expand beyond gaming into compute and home entertainment. Graphics products for the PC segment also reported growth in Q2. Demand for overall DRAM graphics is projected to be up 25% year-over-year in 2015. The revenue for our Storage Business Unit or referred to as SBU was recorded at 954 million in Q2, down slightly quarter-over-quarter. Although our SBU operating margins were down quarter-over-quarter we believe the business is stabilizing and it should improve going forward. We announced three new enterprise products, the co-developed fast drive, a new PCIe express drive and a new database solution. We also announced strategic alliances with Seagate and IBM in the enterprise storage market. Our agreement with Seagate provides an opportunity to sell high performance MLC components and accelerates our expansion into the enterprise flash SSD market. Micron’s current plan in our enterprise drives are based on our award winning 16 nanometer MLC technology which more and more of our customers are seeking due to superior performance compared to competitors’ planar TLC drives. We see a value segment in the channel for planar TLC SSDs and are expecting a late Q3, early Q4 calendar year shipments of our Micron branded 15 nanometer TLC client drive. The mobile business or MBU had another strong quarter. MBU revenues came in at 856 million with operating margins at 31% in Q2. We have indicated on prior calls that our main focus on mobile is optimizing the business for profitability and diversifying the customer base. The team has done a nice job in executing to these objectives. We continue to see strong demand for our mobile products, one example is the increasing prevalence of 3 and 4 gigabyte low power DRAM configurations and a super mid and high-end smartphone segments. We also continue to see significant growth opportunities for Micron in eMCPs. eMCPs generally include 1 to 2 gigabytes of low power DRAM and 8 to 16 gigabytes of NAND in an integrated package. With our innovative DRAM known good die offering and 16 nanometer NAND technology Micron is uniquely positioned to cash for this growing opportunity as eMCPs replace eMMC in the large segments. Revenues in eMCP were up 70% quarter-on-quarter as mobile NAND bit shipments nearly doubled when compared to Q1. We remain bullish on memory content in mobile as evolving system architectures steadily increase density requirements in all handset segments. Higher performance 64 bit application processor SOCs supporting at your OS platforms the richer applications as well as large screen sizes and more advanced gaming all contribute to increased memory density delivering more rewarding experience. Our embedded business posted revenue of 502 million and operating margins were up slightly quarter-over-quarter to 23%. The automotive segment continues to drive EBU performance with the revenue increase of over 10% when compared to the same quarter in fiscal year 2014. We continue to invest in custom segment solutions to drive our leadership in the embedded memory market across all the EBU segments, including IMM Industrial Medical and multi-market, gaming and the connected home. We’re seeing strong market reception for Micron’s next-generation serial NOR Flash product family and should benefit from the signing up of an open industry standardization agreement. We initiated qualification sampling of 16 and 32 gigabyte eMMC version 5.0 to customers in Q2 and began production for the embedded SSD product that addresses the needs of our auto, IMM and gaming customers. A complete portfolio of memory solutions including DRAM, NAND and NOR along with industry consolidation is strengthening Micron’s embedded value proposition as a stable memory focused solutions supplier to the embedded market. In fact now DRAM and NAND now make up more than 70% of our overall embedded business and growing. In closing we’re confident in the long-term dynamics of the memory industry and remain focused on optimizing our margins and returns over the long-term. With that I will hand it back over to Kipp.
Kipp Bedard: Thanks Mark. We now like to take questions from callers. [Operator Instructions] And with that please open up the lines.
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And first question comes from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Harlan Sur: Good to see your DRAM bit supply in upper trajectory, I know that there was some concern that 25 nanometer and 20 nanometer transitions and some of the initial prep work may have inhibited some of the supply growth here in May but it’s good to see that back on a growth trajectory. Can you just help us understand what are the drivers for the bit supply decline in NAND in the May quarter and do you guys expect the resumption of supply growth starting in the August quarter?
Mark Adams: Well, there is a couple of things, one, the primary issue is the mix issue as we shift our products directed more towards mobile and end product SSDs. The second factor is we are getting our factories ready for both transition to new process technology, 16 nanometer TLC, as well as prepping for - in Singapore starting the process for 3D manufacturing.
Harlan Sur: And then I think on the last call you talked about relatively high levels of inventories of SSDs coming out fiscal Q1. What’s your assessment of SSD inventory levels exiting Q2 and then if you can just give us an update on your 16 nanometer SSD products. I think you might have mentioned it, sorry if I have missed this but I think you were talking about last time sort of ramping 16 nanometer SSD kind of second half of this year?
Mark Adams: That’s right. Our assessment is that the industry inventory position on SSDs is improving. We actually think the pricing in the NAND business is stabilized quarter-to-date, and relative to Micron’s performance we've got a number of products that are going out [in qual] [ph] to OEMs that are based on our 16 nanometer MLC, interestingly enough for us we’re seeing a lot of people or some of our customers revert back to an MLC-based SSD drive based on some of the issues that have come up with competitive offerings on performance and endurance and reliability.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox, Cross Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Steven Fox: I was wondering if you could dig in a little bit to the storage business unit. The business swung to losses, I think you partially explained that but maybe we could talk about that a little bit. And then you’ve given some reasons why those losses should reverse back to profits. But I was wondering if you could talk through maybe a roadmap to get into acceptable margins and where you see maybe margins exiting calendar year, et cetera? Thanks.
Mark Adams: So this is Mark I will take the question we try to avoid speculating on future pricing and in projecting margins out in the future but I will comment that we continue to feel very good about the execution of the team in delivering against closing the gap competitively and for all the reasons we’ve talked about in the past those signs are happening; I have talked about in my earlier comments how our mobile NAND business is growing quarter-over-quarter - had a very successful growth trajectory. I think that the 16 nanometer MLC SSD that I communicated just a second ago are pretty good. Our alliance with Seagate and the SaaS development in getting access to these SaaS market earlier than we otherwise would have is pretty good and as we commented into the market last week in our announcement with Intel on the 3D NAND technology we still continue to feel that we’re in a very competitive and market leading position in 3D NAND. So, with all those things in place we are pretty bullish about NAND and we continue to think we’re going to close the gap.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Mark Delaney: I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on your outlook for the DRAM industry for the second half of the year and if you could just talk I know you don’t want to give specific pricing guidance. But if you could at least just talk to the trajectory and linearity of DRAM ASPs over the course of the second quarter and what sort of confidence that may or may not give you as you look into second half overall DRAM’s bottom-end trends?
Mark Adams: Mark, this is Mark Adams. I think that we remain bullish in general on DRAM going forward for the following reasons. First of all, we think that the second half of the calendar year is going to be pretty strong in mobile and all signs are indicating to that. We do think that the PC capacity needs to be shifted over that to address that opportunity and that will balance out some of the current market conditions around PC. I am not sure how to call the PC market other than to say that we think it could improve from here because it is not doing so well and we think the back half of the year with Microsoft new OS and holidays and so on so forth we think it’s just got to be better and hopefully than that it is today. Beyond that when you look at our business we think as we have talked about in the past that it’s a more rational industry and with that is coming better behaviour and as Mark talked about earlier we’re going to do the right things to run our business and if that means not selling inventory below acceptable prices we’ll do it. So if I look at all of that I think about other end market growth I think we’re still in a pretty bullish perspective about DRAM will play out in the second half here.
Mark Delaney: That’s helpful, and it actually kind of gets to my follow-up question, which is around your comments you’re making about holding inventory. Could you elaborate about how long you think you could hold inventory and then can you just talked about how would have to happen if you’re sitting on inventory and market pricing continued to decline just how quickly you have to true up your inventory with pricing in the market?
Mark Adams: Interesting, let me comment on one thing around inventory that you didn’t really asked for but I will get to your answer. General inventory has increased a little bit since the first quarter. Now my interpretation of that is pretty positive. The people who accumulate this inventory on channel that’s how they make money, they make money by taking inventory and waiting to sell in a better market and the accumulation of this is just not dramatic but it’s probably now four or six weeks in DRAM and NAND and as you think about that they’re buying memory at current market pricing and they’re betting on a rebound and these are some people who have been in the business for quite some time I happen to believe that’s a pretty positive sign. Now relating back to the question on how we can do that, well I am not going to give you a number or weeks on-hand or what have you but we do believe that given the diversity of our end markets it is more a matter how we shift our capacity and now that we sit on a bunch of old aged inventory we would just move our capacity to better end markets.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Monika Garg from Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Monika Garg: Just two for clarification, you are guiding high single-digit for production of DRAM bits but for more - for shipment and revenue purposes it’s flattish?
Mark Adams: That’s right.
Monika Garg: So the second question I have is if you look quarter to-date ASP guidance of DRAM you’re guiding minus 9%, it was about minus 6% last quarter. When do you think we see some stabilization in PC DRAM pricing and also if you could talk about pricing the other segments of DRAM like mobile DRAM and server DRAM going forward?
Mark Adams: Sure, Monika this is Mark Adams, relative to pricing it’s hard for us to get on that and try to make projections out in the future. What I would say is the comparison between the 9% and 6% Q2 and Q3 remember the 6% was off a much higher base coming into Q1 and so the 9% and 6% are not really apples-to-apples. We do believe that for the reason I say it is earlier that the overall DRAM business will remain in pretty good shape we don’t see massive price pressure in any of the other segments - are down 6% actually and Q2 was PC down a lot more than 6% and the other segments flat to even some better. So what I would say there is that we don’t see a lot of pressure in the other segments at this point. Now remember each of the businesses this is what is great about diversification, each of these businesses act differently, meaning for example the commodity component DRAM business is what it is and we have noted to be it is a lot smaller portion of our business, but when you look at things like mobile, mobile is a different business. It's a design in business, more concentrated customers in the number of 10 to 15 major customers that we sell to and we negotiate with them and we negotiate more long-term and so that’s a different business. So the pricing dynamics are much different. The fact that pricing stays good it is a great sign for us in mobile and our costs can get better and as we grow our market share we are going to continue to expand our business and that’s true if we look at each of the segments whether it’s the embedded, mobile, networking and automotive that’s all true in terms of how we look at the business, we take each of them as individual segments that run differently.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna. Line is open. Go ahead.
Mehdi Hosseini: Just a question here first, given your ASP cost and bit production and shipment trend, how should we think about trends in DRAM margin profile by different segments particularly for PC, mobile and server DRAM from the coverage quarter to the current quarter and I have just another one?
Kipp Bedard: We’re not going to dive into gross margin by segment, but we’ll give you another chance to ask a different question if you like.
Mehdi Hosseini: How should we think about the impact of use of the inventory since you think demand is going to high, how should we think about the impact of the inventory of that on margin profile in the current quarter?
Mark Durcan: Yes, I think the answer maybe it is Mark Durcan I think the answer is the same that we’re not going to try and predict margins, but the fact that we’re talking about this and by the way it's nothing new. But the fact that we’re talking about our willingness to hold some inventory here. Is really reflective of the fact that we’ve got a lot of confidence, as we move into the back half of the year we’re seeing a lot of signals, Mark talked about a bunch of them I’ll say even with the compute business we get signals from some customers that maybe they want to look at longer term ordering patterns et cetera. So, we got a lot of confidence that this is going to be pretty solid in the back half of the year and that’s probably about all we can say about it.
Mehdi Hosseini: And looking into the NAND and alliance with Seagate and the recent optimism about 3D NAND especially looking into this 48th layer and the fact that Intel also has some collaboration Western Digital, how do all these dynamics play out into 2016 but maybe 48 million 3D NAND would become cost effective to commercialized, do you have direct alliance with Seagate and you have indirect supply into Western Digital through Intel, and any thoughts or any qualitative assessment that you can offer us looking into next year given this kind of a dynamic?
Mark Durcan: Yes let me just say this Mehdi, we compete with Intel in the marketplace, we have for a long time and we expect that Intel product whether it is hit by Intel or by Western Digital will be competitive or will be competing with my comp solutions in the market in 2016. Now the good news is, we think we’ve got a great 3D NAND solution and we also have a lot of capacity at Micron and so we think that overtime, we’re well positioned to do well in that business.
Mehdi Hosseini: But if 3D NAND is going to be the disruptive technology it is going to be the canvas, how you're going to be able to manage the conflict of interest when you're effectively supplying these three different entities?
Mark Durcan: Well it's -- remember Mehdi it is -- the partnership we have with Intel is the co-development, the core technology that’s a big piece of the solution, other areas are the SaaS controller, the firmware, the software and the go-to-market capabilities that each of the other people are interested in it is the Seagate and Western Digital references that comes into the equation of going to market with a full-fledged enterprise SaaS SSD. So as we look at that it's our core technology we have dealt with our partner and there is really two avenues one with Intel taking it through their channel, and one with us taking through our channel.
Kipp Bedard: And by the way if they do well, we’ll be happy to sell them some NAND flash.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from CJ Muse from Evercore. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
CJ Muse: I guess first question regarding your pricing guide for DRAM down high single-digits, can you talk about what like-for-like pricing looks like versus mix shift?
Mark Durcan: So when you think about the pricing like-for-like, the overall price I think we have guided down was 9% for the quarter. So high single-digits and as I made the comment earlier that, that was really driven by where we have exited Q2 going into Q3 as some of the mix changes that to think about our business mobile server and the other markets have pretty stable pricing. So a lot of the fluctuation in the guidance we are giving you is coming out of a quarter that started higher, ended lowered and then we’re starting kind of in the lower base.
CJ Muse: And then as my follow-up, can you walk through the progression that you see in terms of the 20 nanometer ramp at Inotera when you start to see bit production and then when you expect that will have shipment in revenues. And then I guess overtime what are the milestones in terms of percentage of your overall DRAM mix and whatever timeframe you want to discuss?
Mark Durcan: So let me characterize it generally for Micron and then I think relative to Inotera you can get some more specifics from them. But for 20 nanometer we've said the second half of calendar 2016 will be -- sorry the second half of this calendar year will be ramping, and by the time we get into the first half of 2016 it will be the majority of our debt mix.
CJ Muse: And will you say ramping that is production or that is shipment?
Mark Durcan: That is production.
CJ Muse: And how should we think about the…?
Mark Durcan: Let me say it this way then, there will be significant shipments in Q4 of the calendar year for Micron.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rajvindra Gill from Needham & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Rajvindra Gill: Wondering if you could discuss a little bit about the competitive pricing environment in DRAM and NAND, you gave some highlights in terms of what the actual numbers are, but wondering kind of qualitatively what’s happening in the market, and a lot of this positive pieces on the DRAM industry where some rationalization that’s occurring in the industry a rational behaviour. So I’m just wondering if you are seeing that continue if you could describe a little bit about that it will helpful.
Mark Durcan: As I have highlighted today in our script and some of our comments that the real catalyst for some of the disruption here in not just the PC segment was really the demand side. And I think if you talk to other people in that business in the PC business the hard drive guys, the CPUs, the unit declined in the PC notebook segment kind of drove some of this and an interesting thing for us is that none of the other segments kind of showed that, and when you think about where our business is today where it might have come from years ago is, yes our pricing in one of the segments had some pressure in the first quarter, I am sorry in the second quarter. We felt pretty good about the rest of our business and it kind of showed up in our performance. So as I think about driving for us, we clearly in Micron if you look at industry pricing and you look at kind of pricing for gigabit and DRAM for example Micron is clearly the leader in pricing in ASP terms. And so at least historically we've been and we feel like we’re today, and we’re going to continue to try to drive it up and with that, that might mean holding inventory like we said it might mean moving to other segments, server, networking, mobile so on so forth. And so that’s kind of the picture today, I think that my comment earlier about what the timing of channel inventory and even our customer reaction we've had customers try to who initially wanted to get off the quarterly pricing come back to us in this past quarter and want to go back to quarterly pricing. So we’re generally bullish on the dynamics of pricing in the market. And yes there was an industry catalyst in the form of demand for PC, notebooks that drove a little bit of disruption in the business we don’t think it’s major, yes it’s if so you can measure it but the rest of our business is pretty good.
Rajvindra Gill: And on the NAND side, you talked about NAND pricing stabilizing a bit, just wondering what’s driving that stabilization. And can you comment in terms of what percentage of your NAND business will be TLC exiting this year and should we start to see NAND gross margins increases as we exit this year?
Mark Durcan: Well as we think about our business, we think about the end-markets where they are going where the products will be generating the highest return and as we achieved our strategic objectives in NAND. And on a competitive basis okay we believe we will be closing the gap between our competitors in the second half of our fiscal year and throughout 2015 calendar, we believe that will happen. TLC today is less than 10% it’s not a large number today, and as we ramp our staffs it won’t be materially much larger. You will see some growth in the back half of the year but it won’t be materially much larger because we've got other parts of our business whether it be mobile or I talked about the success of our MLC 16 nanometer product as Tier 1 OEM. So we will seek TLC growth at Micron but we’re not going to do it just to do it, we need that mixture nature that we are getting the right value for it and that’s important to us and our business.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tristan Gerra from Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Tristan Gerra: Given the strength of the U.S. dollar there has been some concern about potential dispatching of the year one content that have been PCs. Is that a trend that you are currently seeing or I expect in the second half?
Mark Durcan: I think for us the question around FX is really more a question around what is worldwide GDP growth going to be. We’re a global company. We’ve got global customers some will do better in some FX situation some will do slightly worse. But unless something dramatic happens to worldwide GDP growth we think we’re pretty well positioned with manufacturing all around the world and with customers all around the world some of which will do better in certain circumstances and some of which won’t. So we’re not overly worried about it. Obviously we have manufacturing in Japan and there is a certain cost reduction associated with the weakening yen. Obviously we got some manufacturing in Singapore and certain costs associated with the strengthening Sing But net, net for Micron these aren’t huge effects.
Tristan Gerra: And then what does the ramp of 3D NAND means from an equipment reuse and the point is this going to be a significant percentage of your existing equipment and could this impact the DRAM production next year if some of the equipment gets shifted to other product lines?
Mark Durcan: Absolutely we plan a lot of equipment reuse as we transition planar NAND to 3D NAND I assume that was the question is 3D transition…?
Tristan Gerra: Yes.
Mark Durcan: So there is incremental equipment required the incremental floor space there is some amount of tooling all of which can be reused in other parts of our or the vast majority of which can be reused in other parts of our business. But generally speaking we will be trading out planar NAND wafers for incremental for 3D NAND wafers. And we think that’s the most capital efficient way to run the business.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Kevin Cassidy: May be along those lines also with 3D NAND, is that a drag on gross margins as it first ramps into production and when do you think would be the crossover where it could be a tailwind to gross margin?
Mark Durcan: Sure, it’s almost always a short-term drag on GM when you make the transition like this you’ve got new tools coming in and it takes a while to qualify and get them loaded, et cetera, et cetera. And there are existing efficiencies associated with yields ramps et cetera. So we’re pretty comfortable by the time we get to late in the year, late in this calendar year. We’ll be looking pretty good.
Kevin Cassidy: And you also mentioned that if the DRAM pricing isn’t what you’d expect you’re willing to hold inventory is there any willingness to cut CapEx or is that fixed for this year?
Mark Durcan: We would be willing to do that if we thought the market situation were such that that would make sense to us. I can’t actually foresee that sitting here today. Clearly as we think about our plans for 2016 and things a little bit further out we’ll take into account where the market goes over the next number of months and quarters. But as we sit here today we just told you we think things are looking pretty good so we’re not anticipating making any major changes as we sit at the table today.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Amir from Ladenburg. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Pardon me your line is open. Please go ahead, if you have your phone on mute un-mute your phone please.
Daniel Amir: So in terms of the DRAM side you have expressed that PC DRAM you’re thinking that’s going to decline here in the next couple of quarters. What is the ideal mix that you kind of see your mix of DRAM a year from now? Is it PC DRAM kind of in the 20% level or do you expect it to decline and then come back maybe to 30%?
Mark Durcan: I think directionally where you are going initially was right we think over time it will decline as a percentage of the mix and a lot of it does depend on the business but I think directionally we think you’re spot on.
Daniel Amir: And then the second question is related to it sounds like the eMCP business is something that one of your growth drivers here. Do you feel that this is kind of the leading factor here to drive your mobile business? I mean it’s up 70% Q-over-Q in the eMMC space you probably didn’t have as a bigger competitive advantage is now that you have in the eMMC space given that you have a very good integrated product then with the DRAM side?
Mark Durcan: Yes I think it absolutely I mean in full transparency we’re coming off a somewhat lower base but I think we have stated in prior calls we have stated we think eMCP is for the mobile business coming out of our fiscal year will be somewhere around 25% little bit lower than 25%. But somewhere up from zero in the last 12 months so we as you identified it’s a strategic play for us leveraging our portfolio and quite honestly given our make up in the mobile business we think we’ve got advantage over just about anybody in the space.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from David Wong from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
David Wong: Could you give us some idea about the ownership of the IP associated with 3D NAND technology between Micron, Intel or joint venture entity? And so there was some concern about someone encroaching on your IP or the prosperity of licensing the IP who does the negotiations will drive the legal action?
Mark Durcan: We’re not going to talk about intellectual property strategy, David but I can tell you that we do that, we fund the development together, we do it jointly and we both own different pieces of the intellectual property but beyond that it is not a lot I want to talk about.
David Wong: Well then could you give us some idea of the proportion of your DRAM production in the May quarter between PC DRAM for memory, how you're allocating what you're actually making?
Mark Durcan: Well I think David, I’ll kind of get back and give you some of the comments I gave earlier. We think PC DRAM in the quarter will be down from mid-30s in Q2 to low to 30% kind of range and we think that that will signal increases in other areas such as mobile in the mid-20% server in the low 20% of our business. And so we see kind of a blend it is not just one category picking up with the PC business, mobile is the more capacity will allocate the server some PC business to server and we’ll look at networking on those as well, so that’s kind of a full suite of things we evaluate.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Newman from Bernstein. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Mark Newman: You talked about the inventory on the DRAM side and you're saying your production is going to be up high single-digits, what are the assumptions you're using for the mix shipments for Q3?
Mark Durcan: Mark, I think in the business we can’t, we said basically flat on shipments that we know we don’t say a whole lot more in terms of future guidance. But I think it is just that in other comments around what we’re going to do what is right for the business to drive returning margins and it is not going to be fire sale advantage for us.
Mark Newman: And then a follow-up question on NAND flash, I thought I heard you say components 50% of NAND, could you clarify that, perhaps I misheard? And then I wanted to get some of this kind of ideas from you about how is that going to be fixed over the long-term because clearly as you increase the percentage of your solutions and decrease the percentage of were NAND components that obviously very good for your margins basically moving up the value stack to create to catch more of the value but in addition to that it actually helps to consolidate the NAND market by essentially taking out the competitors because a lot of those were NAND customers are actually in the end of the day there also competitors certainly flash cards and SSD. So could you give us some better roadmap for how we can expect that percentage of components to decrease going forward?
Mark Durcan: So the data I spoke to in my opening comments was that in Q2 component shipments includes cards and components and now it is somewhere around the area of 50% of our overall shipments in the quarter Q2. In Q3 alone that number will be cut by 30% as we start the transition of what you just highlighted away from component card sales to mobile and SSDs. Part of that dynamic by the way in discussing how this plays out is we now will be shipping in the quarters 16 nanometer MLC followed by drives that were in process and didn’t have that volume in Q2. So the move from components and cards to mobile and then client SSD based on 16 nanometer certainly is a positive move for us as you say we move up the stack and we continue to drive things like in enterprise drive both PCIe and SaaS as we explained earlier. That’s how you should think about our target and I mentioned also I think we gave guidance that NAND did grow will be flat to down in the Q3 timeframe as we think about the evolution for 3D manufacturing stuff as well as switch to some of our capacity to those 16 nanometer TLC. We think that all kind of resonates to a better optimize mix of products for NAND portfolio.
Mark Newman: If I could ask just one quick follow-up on for LP DDR4, my understanding is Apple was moving to LP DDR4 for the next iPhone and also I understand 2 gigabytes. Do you have an update on your readiness or your roadmap for LP DDR4 when do you think that will be ready?
Mark Durcan: So I think that Mark it is safe to say that we feel pretty good about our position there both existing 25 nanometer LP DDR4, as well as our 20 nanometer LP DDR4 offering. This is lesser about Micron readiness and more about customer demand lining up for the back half of the year and beyond.
Mark Newman: Got it, thanks very much.
Mark Durcan: And it looks like we have time for about one more caller.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
John Pitzer: I guess I want to back to some of this idea of building inventory in the May quarter, I am kind of curious why is that now and not sort of accelerating the transition to 20 nanometer more quickly because clearly I would argue if you had 20 nanometer at a larger percent of wafer outs your cost structure would be better, and just can’t remember a time of building inventory either internally or in channel has been a good thing. So I am just kind of curious why the inventory decision is not a faster ramp in 20?
Mark Durcan: John this is Mark. So we talked this quarter about how we were doing exactly what you just mentioned, which was in fiscal Q2, we made some adjustments in our manufacturing line to start positioning equipment for the 20 nanometer ramp. These things always in our balance and certainly the market today is not the market of last year or the year before, we have pretty broad diversification in the segment customers and products where we feel pretty good about our ability to move some stuff overtime, if the market demand is out there this quarter. We don’t know exactly what the market demand looks like this quarter maybe we end up not only anything else, we've left ourselves some room to manoeuvre there. But we’re trying to strike a balance between what you are suggesting as well as just building products and then seeing what the market looks like.
John Pitzer: And maybe on my follow-up just on the OpEx line and specifically the R&D line continuous to kind of creep higher especially R&D kind of independent of revenue levels I am just kind of curious to what extent is this just kind of a new structural norm we should expect in R&D where you go after a lot of different market segments with a lot of different products or would you kind of characterize the current spend is kind of accelerating or elevated because of the where we are in the 3D transition or something else or just the long-term guidance on R&D and OpEx would be helpful?
Mark Durcan: Yes so just on the R&D piece, there are a lot of different dynamics implying here, obviously we've got a lot of new 20 nanometer products that were going to want to qualify and ramp. And so we’re always wanting to make sure that we don’t let the R&D dollar spend getting away with qualifying products on a timely basis and getting to the market, and you just said that we should be doing. So there is that dynamic there is also I think there is an overlying dynamic as we start thinking about some of the storage class memories that we talked about making investments in and as we start continue to add resources to position the company deliver system level products that there is a different nature to the R&D spend than there have been historically as well. Now overtime we may spend less on some of the other things we spend R&D dollars on. But what we are talking about right now in terms of over the next number of quarters being up a little bit. I think it’s more related to some of the short-term dynamic around technology ramps and new product introductions.

Kipp A Bedard : I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Mark Durcan, CEO. Mark?
D Mark Durcan : Thanks, Kipp. We had another strong quarter benefiting from continued favorable market conditions and solid execution from the team. We set a new record for quarterly revenue of $4.6 billion. GAAP net income was $1 billion. Free cash flow was $923 million, based on record operating cash flow of $1.6 billion with CapEx of $669 million.  The investments we are making in the business are putting us in position to continue generating strong cash flow. We expect continued favorable market conditions for 2015 led by constrained supply in DRAM and solid demand for both DRAM and NAND. Demand growth in our business continues to be driven by our customers rapidly increasing memory content to enable them to enhance the performance of their products, as opposed to strictly unit growth of end systems. The resulting demand outlook remains very encouraging. A few good examples of this growth include mobile DRAM, server DRAM and solid state drives all of which are expected to increase memory content per system by 30% to 50% in 2015. As just mentioned the outlook for DRAM supply remains tight. We continue to expect industry bit growth in the low to mid 20% range in 2015 with the development of advanced process technology proving to be disruptive to wafer production. Our belief is that even with steps taken to address the otherwise declining gross wafer production in DRAM the net wafer output in the industry will stay relatively steady or decline slightly going forward leading to a relative stability of bit supply growth even beyond 2015. As we have said for some time, compared to DRAM we expect the NAND market to have more volatility although very attractive over the long-term. We are projecting industry supply growth in the high 30% to mid-40% range for 2015 with a significant portion of the range based on deployment of TLC or Triple Level Cell memory. TLC has a compelling cost and price point although there are still some variability in terms of the adoption rate for systems requiring higher performance including certain mobile and SSD applications. We are often asked about the impact of 3D NAND on the industry supply. We don’t believe 3D NAND will significantly change the current supply growth rate in the industry given the trade-off of more bits per wafer offset by fewer wafers produced per fab and the capital cost associated with either planar conversion or greenfield additions. The key supply variable over the long-term is the extent to which demand and economic returns dictates the need to add incremental 3D capacity. Micron’s approach remains steadfast to focus on returns as opposed to growth or scale when we evaluate this market. We are entering an interesting year in our business, deploying evolutionary but increasingly challenging process technology in our fabs while also moving more revolutionary technology closer to commercialization. We are very pleased with our recent progress on DRAM. 25-nanometer deployment has been relatively smooth and 20-nanometer enablement is well underway with many milestones being hit early. The extra R&D resources we have brought to bear and the alignment of manufacturing and R&D resources at Hiroshima are clearly bearing fruit. I will come back to how this deployment is impacting our short-term bit growth outlook in a minute. We also remained very comfortable with the status of our 3D NAND technology development which of course is occurring in collaboration with our JV partner, Intel. 3D NAND enables cost and performance optimization beyond the capabilities of Planar NAND with enhanced product performance across a broad portfolio of applications and significant cost per bit reductions overtime. We commenced early 3D samples in calendar Q4 of 2014 and expect volume commercial production in the second half of calendar year 2015.  Given the confidence in our technology we recently announced plans to add additional clean room space in Singapore to enable our ramp of 3D NAND as well as other emerging memory technologies. This addition effectively doubles the existing fab 10 clean room space and once completed will create additional economies of scale for our non-volatile memory operations in Singapore. The CapEx for this project is estimated to be about $4 billion spent over a number of years with tool installs and production expected to begin in calendar ‘16 and calendar ‘17 respectively. We expect to reserve a portion of this capacity for Intel under our supply agreement. Note our fiscal year 2015 CapEx guidance of $3.6 billion to $4 billion is unchanged as spending this year on new clean room is primarily for design and early construction work. Our Q2 revenue guidance is $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion. Keep in mind we will be moving back to a normal 13 week quarter in Q2 from the 14 week quarter we just completed. In addition to the 13 to 14 week comparison DRAM production is expected to be down sequentially as we prepare fabs for advanced technology deployment including 20-nanometer in subsequent 1x and 1y nodes which we have on our roadmap. These nodes are increasingly challenging which is a good thing in terms of industry supply outlook that can be a short-term headwind in terms of bit shipments. This production will always occur in a normally seasonally slower demand period.  We continue to focus on product excellence, customer service, margins on returns rather than simply shipping additional bits into the market. To give you an update on our longer term bit growth we now expect our DRAM production to come in below the market for calendar year 2015. There are several factors leading to below market growth this year. These include product disruption for technology upgrades just mentioned, 20-nanometer technology which is being deployed in calendar year ‘15 reduces wafer outs about 15% to 20% for a given square foot of clean room space compared to 30-nanometer.  Although we are taking steps to minimize the impact our wafers produced will decline year-over-year. By the way I should note we do have cleaning space available to replace or potentially add net DRAM capacity if and when it makes sense from an ROIC standpoint but at this time we are not planning to make that investment.  Finally, product mix optimization is a factor which continues to grow in importance relative to pure bit metrics. As we diversify and optimize our business ASP per bit, cost per bit and bit growth are all increasingly a function of these decisions. Of course the goal is to provide the most value-added products to our customers within the constrained supply. By way of example this year we are shipping production from DDR-3 to DDR-4 and continue to grow other value-added specialty DRAM products in the mix.  Turning to bit supply and our NAND business, Q2 is marked by a significant shift in the mix towards the mobile segment. The mobile NAND is characterized by higher ASPs, higher cost per bit and lower bit output per wafer compared to our portfolio average. These mix effects are included in the more detailed guidance Ron and Mark will provide in a minute. This shift in mobile or to mobile is a part of reason our NAND bit growth will also be below the market for calendar year 2015. Of course, we were somewhat above the NAND market growth rate in 2014 following the conversion of our Singapore DRAM fab to NAND. Additionally as I mentioned we will begin manufacturing our 3D NAND in the second half of the year and expect what we believe is industry leading 3D technology to have a significant and positive impact over time. Before I wrap-up I would like to take a minute to discuss our partnership and supply agreement with Inotera. The supply agreement has a three year term, renewable on an annual basis. As with any agreement dynamics can evolve overtime and changes are sometimes required to ensure fair economics between all the parties. At this point we are in discussion with our partners regarding the terms for renewing the agreement and we will provide an update when appropriate.  I want to congratulate the team at Micron for a very strong quarter. We have a tremendous opportunity to continue to delivering for our customers and shareholders and we are looking forward to an exciting and productive year in 2015. I'll stop here and turn it over to Ron and Mark before returning for Q&A. 
Ronald C Foster : Thanks Mark. The first quarter of fiscal 2015 ended on December 4th. We posted to our website a file containing the financial information I will cover, including GAAP and non-GAAP results, certain key metrics for the first quarter of fiscal 2015, as well as guidance for the second quarter. Our fiscal 2015 contains an extra week, as Mark mentioned, to synchronize our 52 or 53 week fiscal calendar with the August year-end. By policy the extra week falls in our first fiscal quarter. So our first quarter of fiscal 2015 contains 14 weeks while the rest of the quarters will contain the customary 13 weeks.  The results for the first quarter include net income of $1.003 billion or $0.84 per share on net sales of $4.573 billion. Gross margin came in at 36%, up about three points compared to the previous quarter. Part of this improvement is coming from higher cost in the fourth quarter related to the Tessera license and last time sale of legacy phase change in memory products that we mentioned on our last call. Our reported income from equity method investments for the first quarter was $124 million substantially all of which is attributable to Inotera. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the first quarter was approximately $1.1 billion or $0.97 per share.  Non-GAAP adjustments resulted in a net increased income of $135 million or $0.13 per share and included the following: The amortization of debt discount and other costs of $38 million includes imputed interest on our convertible notes and the discount on the MMJ installment debt; the loss on restructure of debt of $30 million related to primarily to the repurchase and conversion of convertible notes in the first quarter; the $21 million loss from changes in currency exchange rates particularly for the yen arose from the variances in the forecasted balances of non-USD assets and liabilities that resulted in an over hedged position in the quarter; non-cash tax expense from the MMJ and MMT operations was $38 million.  Finally, there was 27 million share anti-dilutive effect of capped calls based on the average stock price during the first quarter of $32.35.  In the second quarter of fiscal 2015 we expect the following significant non-GAAP adjustments; approximately $35 million for amortization of debt discounts and convertible notes and MMJ installment debt; non-cash taxes related to the Elpida acquisition are expected to be approximately $30 million in the second quarter. Also the anti-dilutive effect of our capped calls will be based on the average share price for the quarter. Please refer to the convertible debt dilution table included in the earnings call data file posted on our website. Let’s turn now to our results by technology and guidance for the second quarter. DRAM revenue increased 9% compared to the fourth quarter primarily due to an increase in bit sales volume and stable average selling prices. DRAM gross margin improved a couple of percentage points into the low 40% range. DRAM gross margins for the second quarter using quarter-to-date ASP and projected mix for the quarter should be down slightly compared to the Q1 based on bit production, down high-single to low double digits, ASPs flat to down low-single digits and cost per bit relatively flat.  The key items affecting our DRAM guidance for the second quarter are continued favorable DRAM market conditions with like-for-like pricing generally stable to down slightly in most DRAM market segments, Mark Adams will expand on this in his comments; lower levels of production primarily due to the normal 13 week period in Q2 and equipment upgrades in preparation for the next generation process technology as Mark Durcan mentioned earlier.  On the trade NAND side revenue increased 14% in the first quarter with a 20% increase in bit sales volume, partially offset by a 6% decrease in average selling price. Trade NAND gross margin was down slightly to the mid-20% range as cost reductions per bit partially offset decreases in selling prices. Trade NAND gross margins for the second quarter using quarter-to-date ASP and projected mix for the quarter are expected to be down low to mid-single digits compared to Q1 based on bit production flat to down low-single digits with the normal 13 week period in Q2 as I mentioned. ASPs flat to down low-single digits and cost per bit up mid-single digits primarily relating to mix.  Key trends for the second quarter effecting this guidance are like-for-like pricing is down mid-single digits, pricing pressure in the spot market and with client SSDs early in the quarter although these markets have begun to stabilize of late, and a shift in mix to a higher concentration in mobile and managed NAND products which has a slightly improving effect on margin with increases in both ASP and cost per bit. On a consolidated basis we're guiding total revenue for the second quarter in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion which reflects the normal 13 week period.  Looking at other P&L and cash flow results and guidance, SG&A expense in the second quarter is expected to be relatively stable when compared to Q1, which came in just below our guidance. R&D expense in the first quarter was below our guided range primarily due to improved execution of product qualifications. We expect a higher level of qualification activities in the second quarter which is contemplated in our guidance. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year is estimated at $2.9 billion but will vary based on the changes in the timing of equipment receipts.  As Mark mentioned the company generated record operating cash flow in the first quarter of $1.6 billion and ended the quarter with $5.3 billion in cash and marketable investments. During the first quarter we spent $532 million on dilution management relating to our convertible notes. We also replaced our $175 million U.S. AR-backed credit line with a $600 million AR and inventory-backed credit line. No amounts have been drawn under either of these facilities.  During the first quarter we announced Board authorization to repurchase up to $1 billion of our common stock. Any repurchases under the authorization would be performed opportunistically in open trading windows. There were no share repurchases during the first quarter. Expenditures for property plant and equipment in the first quarter were $669 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the fiscal year to be between $3.6 billion and $4 billion. Note that beginning of the first quarter we are combining substantially all payments for property plant and equipment into a single line in the investing section of the statement of cash flows. Historical periods have been reclassified as well to facilitate comparability.  In prior periods our disclosure of capital expenditures was the sum of expenditures of property plant equipment and payments on equipment contracts. So there is no change in the disclosure of total capital expenditures just a landscape change on the cash flow statement. We estimate that for every one Yen change in the U.S. dollar-yen exchange rate our cash expenses in Japan changed approximately $2.5 million. Our Q2 guidance contemplates the U.S. dollar to yen exchange rate at the end of Q1, which was approximately 120 yen to the dollar. As a reference the average exchange rate during the first quarter was approximately 110. Now I'll turn it over to Mark Adams for his comments. 
Mark Adams: Thanks, Ron. I will cover a review of our Q1 operating performance as well as share commentary on market insights, key segment trends and memory industry dynamics as we enter calendar 2015.  Our Computing and Networking Business Unit, referred to as CNBU had an outstanding quarter recording $2.1 billion in revenues. Our operating margins came in at 30% compared to 26% in Q4. CNBU benefited from a slightly higher DRAM prices and lower cost has led to overall [ph] improved operating performance in the quarter. The growing diversification of our end market is reflected in a favorable mix across our computing, server, networking, enterprise and graphic segments.  Demand in the PC-client segment remained strong in our first quarter. These shipments in client grew heading into the holidays and pricing held firm in Q1. We commenced volume shipments of our 25 nanometer technology into the client PC tier 1 OEM customer base which resulted in improved cost. Driven by continued growth in cloud computing and data analytics we achieved both record revenue and bit shipments in our sever business.  Server DRAM bit growth is forecasted to grow 40% year-on-year. The growth in server-based memory is based on increasing server workloads that require higher DRAM performance and density. Our server business remains a very attractive segment with a demand profile that is less sensitive to price fluctuations in the market. The Networking segment delivered revenue growth of up 5% quarter-on-quarter. Demand remained strong driven by LTE build out in China and other emerging markets. We are optimistic that bandwidth requirements from increased data, audio video and gaming content projected to grow roughly 20% in calendar year 2015 will drive higher demand from Micron's memory products in a business that yields attractive gross margins.  Our Graphics business which is another market segment that delivers favorable ASP and margin uplift grew Q1 revenues 18% when compared to fiscal year Q1, 2014. Last year consoles doubled their memory content per box and we feel that there will be a digital content growth this year as the use of these devices continues to expand beyond gaming into more compute and home entertainment functions.  We had a strong quarter in DRAM technology enablement. We are pleased with the team's execution on DDR4 as major OEMs are in qualification for their value added configurations. While coming off a relatively low base shipments of DDR4 increased four times quarter-over-quarter. We are seeing very strong demand signals for DDR4 in the coming quarters, in particular from the enterprise server customer base. DDR4 ASPs remain at a significant premium to DDR3 given the enhanced performance. As the market for DDR4 begins to take shape over the next 12 months and beyond the rate of growth should positively impact our average ASP. We're seeing good progress of our eight gigabit GDDR5 technology as we're shipping engineering samples to two of our larger enabling partners.  And finally the research and development team saw fantastic progress in the enablement of our 20 nanometer technology DRAM process. We are evaluating ways to accelerate this transition ahead of our current plan.  Our Storage Business Unit or SBU achieved $987 million in revenue in Q1, up 9% quarter-on-quarter. Our SBU operating margins were stable this quarter despite some challenging pricing dynamics. It appears there has been some additional TLC capacity, in both the channel components and client SSD segments which applied downward pressure on pricing towards the end of our first quarter and into our current quarter.  As we produce primarily MLC technology we are focused on finding higher value opportunities that require best-in-class performance and are trying to minimize our exposure through aggressive market pricing. We are making good progress in driving our SSD roadmap to our award winning 16-nanometer technology. We successfully qualified the M600 drive at a tier-1 PC OEM customer and anticipate additional commitments over the next 90 days. In addition today we are announcing two crucial branded client-SSDs enabled by Micron’s 16-nanometer process for shipment in this quarter. We expect to have 50% of our client-SSD shipments on 16-nanometer by the end of our first quarter.  On our last call I outlined the steps we were taking to improve our overall NAND competitiveness. I wanted to give you an update on our progress. Our focus is in three areas; process advancement, system level enablement and higher value end market applications. We successfully hit the forecasted milestone to deliver engineering samples of our 60 nanometer TLC device by the end of calendar 2014. We are targeting late spring shipments of TLC components to the channel and consumer segments and expect to commence shipping at TLC client-SSD drive into the market during the second half of 2015.  Micron will continue to increase our leadership in overall NAND scaling demonstrated by our vertical cell 256 gigabit MLC and 384 gigabit TLC 3D NAND devices, which we believe will have the highest density per square inch of silicon in the industry. We are now sampling our 3D NAND component and remain on track for initial commercial production during the second half of calendar 2015.  Beyond innovation at the technology level we continue to add controller and firmware resources that are helping to accelerate product development and enhance the quality of our enterprise datacenter and client-based SSD products. In addition we are investing in packaging capabilities that allow us to integrate technologies to offer performance, power and/or reliability benefits. Such capabilities are the foundation for driving into more solution-oriented products designed to meet specific customer needs.  Finally we are continuing to diversify our NAND business into more attractive end market applications. As an example revenue for NAND sold into the mobile segment was up over 45% quarter-over-quarter. Coupling NAND with DRAM in the form of eMCPs is a high growth opportunity which I will discuss in the Mobile segment shortly.  Our Enterprise SSD business set a revenue record in Q1 and margins were up quarter-over-quarter as the team drove qualifications of our M500DC product into cloud and datacenter customers. We are evaluating options to accelerate growth into this expanding segment of the market that includes datacenter, cloud, networking, security search and e-commerce customers. The fundamental for long-term growth drivers, such as client enterprise storage, mobile storage and embedded applications driving the NAND consumptions continues to be positive. We are meeting the milestones we set in our plan to improve the long-term operating competitiveness and feel optimistic about our position going forward.  The Mobile Business Unit or MBU had another outstanding quarter. MBU revenue came in at $940 million. Operating margins were 32% in Q1 compared with 22% in our last quarter. We continue to see strong demand in mobile. The iPhone 6 launch was a catalyst for strong holiday demand. Memory content per devices driving customer forecast in 2015. On the high end the Samsung Note is shipping with 3 gigabytes of low powered DRAM and Chinese competitors such as Xiaomi are differentiating with larger memory configurations.  The low to mid-range priced smartphone market is driving additional memory content as well and even the future phone segment is evolving from phones with virtually no DRAM to new products such as the Android 1 which has 1 gigabyte of low powered DRAM. We are also seeing higher memory content in Flash where mid and high end smartphones have shifted configurations from 32 gigabytes and 64 gigabytes to 64 gigabytes and 128 gigabytes. On the product front we are growing our managed NAND business with increased shipments of the eMCPs. The rapid adoption of the eMCPs by the mid-range market where there is strong growth has created significant opportunity for Micron. With our capability of supplying known good die flow from the former Elpida operations and our 16-nanometer NAND technology Micron is uniquely positioned to capture this growth opportunity as eMCPs move to replace eMMC in the largest mobile segments. The team is also working on low power DDR4 enablement with our chipset partners that will allow for key customer differentiator in the future. As Mark and I’ve said in prior communications we are focused on a returns approach to the mobile business. We are pleased with the progress the team has made to-date. We are constrained to meet our customer demand forecast and continue to evaluate how to best balance our overall capacity to support Micron’s valued customers. Our Embedded Business or EBU set a quarterly revenue record achieving $539 million in sales. This is our 8th consecutive quarter of revenue growth for EBU. Our operating margins rose to 22%, up from 16% last quarter. This growth was driven by record shipments to the automotive and industrial and multi market segments. Automotive revenues were up 18% quarter-on-quarter. The automotive segment continues to benefit from memory content fueled by both infotainment and advanced driver assistant systems in the new offerings. Our commitment to the unique needs of this market in areas such as quality, reliability, product longevity and service have enabled us to strengthen our market leadership in Q1. The broad category of industrial and multi market was up 12% quarter-on-quarter driven by continued growth in factory automation, machine-to-machine and aerospace and defense. As we see strong demand growth in areas such as automotive entertainment consumer electronics, connected smart homes and machine-to-machine systems we remain optimistic for a strong demand environment in our EBU business for fiscal year 2015. It is worthy of note that we have recorded our fourth consecutive quarter of growth in NOR product shipments with over 470% now on our 45-nanometer process. We will continue to seek opportunities to leverage our portfolio of DRAM, NAND and NOR to drive continued growth and profits in the embedded market. Coming off a strong fiscal year ‘14 our operations team is focused on managing through a number of transitions to ensure long-term competitiveness. On the integration front we implemented Micron’s manufacturing information systems in our fabs in both Hiroshima and Taiwan in Q1. We are also driving expanded 25-nanometer technology at MMJ and MMT. In conjunction with our R&D organization MMJ is preparing for a second half calendar year ‘15 conversion to 20-nanometer which looks very promising with a focus on polling end of day [ph] for volume production. In preparation for these technology transitions we will see lower DRAM bit production in Q2 which will result in small production down side already contemplated in the forecast that both Mark and Ron messaged in their comments. The team is also busy preparing our plan for the recently announced fab expansion in Singapore which we feel offers us the flexibility to efficiently expand the 3D and emerging memory production in the future as the market conditions warrant. Finally in the backend of our business we signed a strategic agreement to partner with PTI to provide a local assembly services on our Xi'an campus which will both lower cost and overall cycle time.  I would like to now briefly discuss what we are currently seeing in the market post holidays. Pricing environment for our portfolio of DRAM products remains favorable overall. We have seen modest pricing pressure in the PC segment which is not surprising due to seasonality. Mobile DRAM pricing remains relatively stable as we remain very tight on supply in Q2. On the NAND front pricing saw some softness during the last month of Q1 and the first month of Q2. That being said we are seeing some signs of improved price in NAND of late including tightened of supply in certain segments such as low density consumer NAND. Our sense is that client SSD inventory at Tier 1 OEM is still somewhat high post-Christmas.  We also saw increasing TLC supply from what had believed to be one of our competitors, shifting NAND production away from their own internal mobile consumption to the channel and client SSD business. Despite these short term pressures, which could potentially cause short term margin compression we feel these effects are temporary and remain bullish on the longer term outlook for NAND and we feel we are taking the right steps to optimize our business over the long run. As the industry converts to 3D NAND we feel our performance and cost will continue to improve, driving accelerated adoption in NAND in the client, mobile and enterprise market segments.  In closing, I too want to congratulate our team on another great quarter. We are excited about the enablement of a number of the technology advancements I referenced to my comments and feel we are well positioned for continued success in a diversifying memory business. With that, I will hand it back over to Kipp. 
Kipp A Bedard : Thanks Mark and we will now take questions from callers. Karen, would you please open the lines at this time. Thank you. 
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. Our first quarter comes from the line of Monika Garg from Pacific Crest. 
Monika Garg : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First question on the NAND market. If you look at your cost decline and ASP assumptions, the NAND margins are going down again in the quarter. So the question is why not to delay the conversion to 3D NAND and so that there is a lower bit growth in the market and let the market become even stronger before kind of adding more bits to the market?
D Mark Durcan : Monika, first of all I would point out that the NAND market to us is really long-term very, very attractive. We see a lot of growth there and we think it’s worth investing in. Having said that we believe that 3D is a key enabler to future leading edge products and frankly to long-term success in the business. And therefore as we look at our business we're prepared to invest in it. We haven't said a whole lot about what the rate of our ramp would be or exact timing as to when we would bring on additional supply but we do believe it's important to getting moving down the path and introducing our 3D products into the marketplace and enabling those end applications to use our products.  Having said all of that, I think we’ve tried to be pretty clear that there is a discipline in our approach, that we're going to look at the market on an ongoing basis and make sure that we don't disrupt supply and that we think 3D is not something that is likely to be some sort of step function sea change in terms of how Micron or other competitors in the marketplace manage their production and that's because there are trade-offs here. As you point out there is capital investment required, there is clean space and it's not -- while it's enabling and important it's not a massive disruption that we believe will create the oversupply you are alluding to. 
Monika Garg : Thanks. Just to follow up on the Inotera, could you provide any color on when could we expect the kind of the new -- I guess if you negotiate that agreement with of Inotera, when can we see the impact on the financials. Thanks. 
D Mark Durcan : I don't think that there is a lot we can add to what we've already said relatively to Inotera. It's a three year agreement, as we said before; it's renewable on an annual basis. We value the relationship, we think the other parties value the relationship when we think that, that sets a foundation for a reasonable discussion to lead to a long-term beneficial outcome for all parties.  But trying to discuss in advance when and what that might look like I don’t think is particularly productive. 
Monika Garg : Thank you so much. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of -- excuse me, Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. 
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for taking my question. I have two. On DRAM can you please help me understand the mix between consumer PC, server and mobile and how this mix changed from November into the February quarter? And then on the NAND, it's great to give us an update on the milestones, but I'm still little bit confused what the strategy is. Are you trying to be everything to everyone or are you trying to be more focused on a specific segment of NAND that you are pursuing? Any color there would be appreciated. Thank you. 
Mark Adams: So I will start with the first question. As it relates to the share in the DRAM segment, it’s best to think of our PC business, the PC DRAM business somewhere in the mid-30% share wise and our mobile DRAM business somewhere in the mid-20% and servers, roughly high-teens. And directionally while these things are really tough to shift in one quarter you see a mild uptick as we start to shift some more capacity over to server in Q1. Mobile was roughly flat and the server business was like in the client business, PC business was maybe down a little bit but that’s roughly how it shifted in the relative size of the share and DRAM.
D Mark Durcan : And Mehdi, this is Mark Durcan. Maybe I will take the NAND piece of that question. At a high level what we said is we want to play in a lot of different application segments for NAND and we acknowledge that takes a lot of resources and then getting the balance of those resources right requires ongoing work and when you do a better job over the next couple of years then we have done over the last couple of years, relative to how we allocate those resources.  Having said that, we talked in our commentary, we feel like it’s important for us to be in the mobile NAND segment. We think we have a lot of synergy with our low power DRAM business there and with our customers. We think there is a lot of value added things we can do for them in the mobile segment. We can’t ignore what is a very large and fast growing segment in the market, which is the client SSD piece and we clearly want to be in the enterprise because over the long haul we are going to drive significant value there. So we will continue to put our resources across a number of different applications segment and then allocate our capacity as we see our progress in all of those different segments.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman from RBC Capital Markets.
Doug Freedman: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. When I look at your guidance it assumes a little bit of challenging environment for you in terms of cost declines. Can you maybe walk us through what is happening at Inotera with the -- migration and what, if any impact that will have on the DRAM cost per bit?
Mark Adams: Yes, maybe I will take that. You know as I mentioned, mix is an increasingly important piece of the answer in all these questions because as we move to more value added applications that’s going to drive different bit growth, think about DDR3 to DDR4 there is 10% to 15% die sizes [ph] that are moving to that technology depending on exactly how you are positioned. That’s going to mitigate bit growth in the year but it’s going to probably drive value. The customers certainly see a lot of value in getting a DDR4 today.  Likewise as we move to more differentiated products to service networking and higher performance computing and move more of our men in that direction we won’t see the clients we have seen in the past but hopefully we will see value add commence by the customer. You know beyond that I would say there is not a lot structurally that would change here other than you should recognize that Micron today is deploying capital to support a 20 nanometer ramp that is a large productivity step. And any time you deploy capital you don’t get a return spontaneously. It takes a while for that capital equipment to installed and productive and for the load line to be loaded and moved to inventory out in the marketplace. And so you have to contemplate that a little bit as 2015 is an exciting year for us in terms of technology deployments. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox from Cross Research.
Steven Fox: Thanks, good afternoon. Two questions from me, just to dig in a little bit more on the client SSD market; how much -- can you just sort of go into some color as to how much of the competiveness you are seeing is temporary and then from a Micron standpoint how much gets kind of fixed as you roll out your TLC product or is there other things that you can do to improve margins there?  And then secondly, if you can sort of give us a little bit more of a color around the DDR4 timing of the ramp and how that's going to affect your mix and margins because I guess I was on the impression maybe we're going to start to see more in the quarter we're in now. Thanks. 
Mark Adams: So, on the SSD side, we started to see kind of pre-holiday inventory build at the key customers and we truly do believe it's a temporary piece of the market dynamics in NAND. What we have been saying, as I said over the last week or so is that the NAND price actually stabilized a bit in some sense and some segments has gone up. So relative to the question on TLC competitiveness, as we bring those products to market as I mentioned in my comments early in the second half of calendar year '15 we do expect to be able to compete more favorably and will then be able to drive more of our mix to the TLC SSD client products.  At this point as we look at our opportunities there, we're just being careful not to try to compete with lower cost products when we can take these MLC products and trying to pursue better or higher value homes. On the DDR ramp, as I said earlier we're pleased with the ramp, although it still early and we think it's reasonable to see by the end of our fiscal year somewhat in the area of 30% plus or minus of our server bits will be DDR4 and really will let the market dictate what that looks like as far as the ramp and scaling it up.
Steven Fox: Thank you. That's very helpful.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. 
John Pitzer: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. My first question is just kind of a follow up on the bit production for DRAM. Can you quantify how much slower than the market do you expect to grow this year and I guess importantly given the timing of product transitions, technology transitions would you expect big growth to resume sequentially from the February to the May quarter. 
D Mark Durcan : Let me take the last bit of that John then maybe Mark can take the first part, Mark Adams take the first part. I think we will see as we move out in time, a get back to sort of a more normal bit growth rate quarter-over-quarter. As I mentioned just a minute ago when you deploy technology sometimes there is disruptions in manufacturing. In particular you want to make sure you're facilitating all the equipment to have legs out in the time and then as you deploy that technology you don't necessarily get the bits and the output immediately.  So yes, we would anticipate being back on a more normal trajectory further out in the year. 
Kipp A Bedard: And John would you repeat the first half of your question for Mark please. 
John Pitzer: By how much do you think you'll under grow DRAM bit growth this year? You said you'd under grow industry?
Mark Adams : Well, we never held a whole lot of position in that but it kind of depends on the mix of DDR4 we put out into the marketplace and exactly how we progress with some of these specialty products I was talking about. We said sort of for the market in the low to mid 20's and we think we'll probably be 20% plus or minus, a little bit lower.
John Pitzer: And then guys on the NAND profitability side, you guys have been working hard over the last 12 months to improve that. One of the arguments was that you were just selling bits into the wrong market and as mix improved you would start to see the margin benefit. You are starting to see that mix improvement, it sounds like in your prepared comments that the move to mobile is accretive but not a big enough move in mix yet to actually drive gross margins higher. Can you help me understand where the mix of mobile in NAND is today and given where you think that mix is going to go, are you confident thinking that February might be the gross margin trough for the NAND?
D Mark Durcan : Let me take the first part of that. I think the first part of your statement was right. We are unhappy with the progress. There is not enough of that yet to be really moving the needle in the overall scheme of things. I would comment that the NAND business generally has been a little tougher for our competitors as well over the last number of quarters. The relative improvement is better than the absolute improvement so to speak when you look at it. And we continue to put the pieces together for the longer term and we think we're making progress doing that. 
Mark Adams: And I can just make comment on the front part where you talked about the product mix, John. And mind you these things are not necessarily things that shift dramatically in a quarter, but to your point you will see mobile as a percent of our overall NAND business just quarter-over-quarter almost double in terms of the share of the business, up to close to 20, almost slightly 20% slightly below 20% of our NAND business. And then you will see a healthy shift away from our products and component business as we do this and find better homes and we'll continue to look at ways to drive enterprise storage in client SSDs for markets that make sense.  Mark made an interesting comment in his prepared statement today that we are finding customers that are not totally invested in TLC for their client-SSDs where they're finding higher performance requirements or just simply reliability issues that they don't want to bet on in TLC. And so we're going to continue to drive our customers to evaluate our higher performing MLC based client SSD storage as we drive that forward as well. And so that should be the trend you see mobile, a shift away from channel and driving more enterprise and high performance client SSD. 
John Pitzer: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Newman from Bernstein.
Mark Newman: Hi, yeah, thanks for taking my question. The results on DRAM continue to do very, very well, continue to be more stronger than expected actually. When I think if I could summarize what you're saying, we think that the markets are going to be strong and that's going to continue throughout 2015. But looking at NAND, obviously continues to disappoint I think with gross margins down and looks like you're projecting down again next quarter. So the question really I have for you and some of that you've already talked about but I want to ask more specifically, do you think this is -- this somewhat disappointment on the NAND side I would say or delay in the recovery it seems to be, is it related to the market being worse than expected due to oversupply in the market or is it difficulties on execution? And what kind a timing should we expect for improvement on the NAND side. It seems like the NAND recovery or it seems to be about two quarters off in obviously TLC, SSDs or both have been mentioned as a big part of that solution. Now it seems like you're moving some of your mix to mobile. So I'd like to understand what the updated plan really is to improve the profitability of the NAND. Thanks. 
Mark Adams: Good, Mark, hey Mark this is Mark Adams, thanks for the question. Couple of things, if you look back over the last couple of quarters on a relative basis, our margins have held pretty stable relative to our competition, actually closing -- incrementally closing the gap a little bit. Now we're not satisfied with that by any stretch but actually those are different data points. This quarter, again gross margin was pretty flat in a relatively tough period for NAND in the market dynamics. So as a backdrop to your question that's what we're up against.  When you talked about kind of a confusing our change in strategy, I don't think that's the case. Please don't mix TLC with where the end application products go. You mentioned TLC and now a shift to mobile. Actually mobile enterprise and client SSDs were always part of our strategy and continue to be part of our strategy. TLC is the technology foundation for what we enable low cost solutions in the market and we invest in that.  Over the last year, both Mark and myself have made comments to the tune of sampling at the end of the calendar year. That's in place. We've done that. We're in process and starting qualifications. We said components and consumer applications would be shipping late spring, end of the calendar second quarter and we'll be launching client-based SSDs drives of TLC. Those are all tactics to the strategy of deploying TLC where it makes sense in the market. That's not the whole story.  Using our DRAM and NAND technology and knowing it could flow from either Elpida combined with our technology in MLC and eventually TLC we're going to launch and develop the mobile market. We're going to continue investing in controllers and firmware and software technology, to advance both enterprise and client SSDs. We don’t see TLC in the enterprise just yet. We will continue to evaluate that path but that’s an end market that has nothing to do with TLC or MLC.  On the client side same thing, we are going to still make client MLC drives but in markets that are looking for lower cost alternatives and willing to sacrifice in performance we will deploy TLC. So those areas of mobile and enterprise and client storage are three pillars of where we are investing to drive applications and the technology, whether it be MLC or TLC is the core to how we get there.
Mark Newman: Got it, that’s very, very helpful. Which area do you think is more -- how would you order the margins for Micron amongst the businesses in NAND out of client SSD, enterprise SSD, mobile and everything else, how would you order those?
Mark Adams: I think the best way to look at it is enterprise SSDs are likely to garner the highest margins, mobile would probably be second and client SSDs third of those three and then there is still healthy in terms of volume, is a components channel out there for consumer applications and embedded application so on and so forth. So that can vary depending on the overall market dynamics.
Mark Newman: I see. And then looking forward to later on this year, do we expect that the market is going to become healthier in NAND flash? Do we need to see a healthier market in NAND for margins to get back up significantly higher than this, do you think?
Mark Adams: Well as we as it’s always tough to project, I would say I want to caution you. The gut feel right now based on the feedback from our customers is that NAND is going to be relatively tight now. When we talk about this changing business we are in it doesn’t mean that you won’t have small period, temporary periods where there is an oversupply in certain segment of the market whether it be a client SSD issue, whether it be something else and so we think overall with the growth in demand drivers in mobile, enterprise and client that overall we think it’s going to be in pretty shape and the type of demand forecast we are seeing from our customers suggest that things will remain in balance and be pretty positive in the remainder of our fiscal year.
Mark Newman: Great, that’s very helpful. Thanks very much.
Kipp A Bedard: Thank you Mark. and Karen I think we have time for one more caller.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question for today comes from the line of Daniel Amir from Ladenburg.
Daniel L. Amir: Thanks a lot, thank you for taking my call. So I was wondering here what is basically changed, maybe from your perspective in the past 90 days, is this more the DRAM business, more the NAND business because it certainly looked like that 90 days ago there was a more of a thought here that the NAND business might be in a change, demand remains pretty solid for DRAM but now you are looking at maybe lower bit growth here. So has something surprised you on the negative side or was this kind of a thought process 90 days ago of the business? Thanks.
D Mark Durcan : Sure, thanks for the question, the way I would answer that is that we don’t see any structural change in the business. On the NAND side we do believe there were some shifting of some capacity from competitors into -- away from certain segments and into the kind of low volume segment that hit pricing a little bit on the spot market and in the client entry level client devices and what have you but we don’t see any structure there we think actually we are very bullish still on the NAND demand side of the business. And in the DRAM piece I think Mark spoke to rationale behind what drove our decisions to making the DRAM capacity long-term decisions in investments. So we still think it’s very good business very stable and ASPs are relatively flat and we are still pretty positive.
Daniel L. Amir: All right great, thanks.
Kipp A Bedard : Thank you, Daniel. And with that we would like to thank everyone for participating on the call today. If you please bear with me, I need to repeat the Safe Harbor protection language.

Kipp Bedard: I'll now turn the call over to Mark Durcan. Mark?
Mark Durcan: Thanks, Kipp. We had another strong quarter benefiting from robust market demand as well as solid operational execution. We set a new record for revenue of over $4.2 billion for the quarter. Net income was $1.15 billion or $0.96 per diluted share. For the fiscal year 2014, we generated record revenue of $16.4 billion, record net income over $3 billion, and record free cash flow of $2.6 billion based on record operating cash flow of $5.7 billion less CapEx of $3.1 billion. As we enter fiscal 2015, I'd like to touch on a few key areas of focus as well as provide a brief industry update. Ron Foster will follow with a financial summary and before turning to Q&A, we'll close our prepared comments with Mark Adams covering additional details of our operational performance and market conditions. Beyond ongoing advanced component and technology development, we have three main operational focus areas for fiscal 2015. The first is technology deployment and includes continued 25-nanometer DRAM conversion and 20-nanometer DRAM ramp, completion of 16-nanometer planar NAND conversion and introduction of 3D NAND, TLC NAND deployment for cost sensitive applications and building out our capability to deliver advanced packaging solutions and controllers. The second is optimizing manufacturing capacity, which includes improving our manufacturing efficiency through line balancing, cycle time, yield, and metrology initiatives, and managing our product mix in order to generate the best possible long-term margins and returns for our business. And finally in 2015, we will focus on growing our memory systems and subsystem solutions, including expanding the market penetration and our offering breadth of our advanced bit addressable memory solutions, building additional storage solutions such as enterprise SSDs, and designing new and innovative mobile memory systems solutions. As we outlined at our Analyst Day last month, fiscal 2015 CapEx is expected to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $4 billion. Roughly 30% of this CapEx will go towards non-supply expanding investments, including manufacturing efficiency improvements, emerging memories, backend capability and additional system manufacturing and engineering tooling to support system and subsystem level products. This compares to about 25% of our $3.1 billion CapEx bill in fiscal 2014, and highlights our belief that these investments, which are designed among other things to enhance our value-added product portfolio will generate some of the highest returns going forward. In terms of the more traditional investments in memory process technology, DRAM will represent about 50% and NAND will represent about 20% of our total CapEx in 2015. This compares to roughly 45% and 30% to 35% respectively in 2014. We expect the bit growth we generated from technology in calendar 2015 to be in line or below the market for both DRAM and NAND. Our big growth profile is reflective of the strategy to grow the mix of premium and value added products while maintaining and improving operational efficiency and costs. While this will lead to less pure supply growth, we expect we will generate more attractive and sustainable margins over time with this approach. Our long-term outlook for the memory industry remains favorable. For DRAM, we are forecasting 2014 industry supply growth of around 30%. In 2015, we expect DRAM industry bit growth in the low to mid 20% range, and beyond 2015 we expect industry supply growth to slow somewhat ranging from the high teens to mid-20s. Part of this encouraging supply trend is due to the fact that 20-nanometer and sub 20-nanometer process technology ramps significantly reduce the wafer production for existing clean room space. We believe the DRAM industry; supply demand balance will continue to be favorable for the foreseeable future. Demand elasticity has declined from historical levels, and cost per bit is no longer the major factor driving demand growth. For NAND, we are projecting industry supply growth in the high 30% to low 40% range for 2014. This includes an increase in industry wafer production of just over 10%, with the remaining supply growth coming from technology. We expect 2015 industry supply growth to be in the high 30% to 40% -- to mid-40% range, beyond 2015 when 3D becomes more prevalent in the market, supply growth will depend on new capacity investment. Although 3D technology drives a significant increase in bits per wafer, without capacity investment, this is offset by substantial decreases in wafer output per square foot of clean room space. The demand profile matches up well with the existing supply growth rate and we also believe that due to elasticity of demand for NAND and client enterprise storage applications, the demand growth could be significantly higher over time. At Micron, we will continue to manage our NAND business, focused on long-term returns. I want to congratulate the whole Micron team for a tremendous year. We look forward to building on the success in 2015. The memory industry continues to look very attractive. We've never been better positioned to deliver differentiated value for our customers and shareholders. I'll stop here and turn it over to Ron and Mark before turning for Q&A. Ron?
Ron Foster: Thanks Mark. Our fourth quarter 2014 and fiscal year ended on August 28. We posted to our Web site a file containing the financial information I will cover including GAAP and non-GAAP results, certain key metrics for fiscal 2014, the fourth quarter, as well as guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2014, we posted record revenue and net income, as Mark mentioned, with net income of $3 billion or $2.54 per diluted share on net sales of $16.4 billion. This compares to the fiscal 2013 results of net income of $1.2 billion on net sales of $9.1 billion. Recall that the 2013 results include the $1.5 billion non-cash gain in the fourth quarter from the purchase accounting for Elpida and Rexchip, which we now refer to as Micron Memory Japan or MMJ and Micron Memory Taiwan or MMT. The results for fiscal 2014 reflect continued healthy market conditions, particularly for DRAM products and our focus on maximizing long-term returns in the business. Non-GAAP net income increased significantly comparing 2014 to 2013. Now focusing on the fourth-quarter results, we posted net income of $1.150 billion or $0.96 per diluted share on net sales of $4.2 billion. The fourth quarter gross margin of 33% includes a $66 million charge associated with a patent license with Tessera. The go-forward license will have cost of goods sold charges that are not anticipated to have a material impact to any future quarterly period. In addition, gross margin in the fourth quarter was adversely affected by $38 million from a last time sale of legacy architecture mobile PCM or phase change memory products which was mentioned last quarter as part of our guidance. Without these two items, gross margin for the fourth quarter would have been higher by approximately 2.5 percentage points. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the fourth quarter was $961 million, or $0.82 per share. Non-GAAP adjustments netted to a reduction of income of $189 million or $0.14 per share in the fourth quarter and included the following. The charge related to the Tessera license mentioned previously, restructured charges in the quarter of $22 million which were primarily related to employee termination benefits from a workforce reduction in Italy. Amortization of debt discounts and other costs of $37 million in the fourth quarter includes imputed interest on our convertible notes and the discount on the MMJ installment debt. The loss on restructure of debt of $17 million related to primarily to the repurchase and conversion of convertible notes in the fourth quarter including mark-to-market adjustments of the 2031 B-notes to be settled in the first quarter of this year. Non-cash taxes from the MMJ operations were $118 million benefit in the fourth quarter, which includes a benefit from a change in the estimated utilization of net operating loss carryforwards for MMJ and MMT. A couple of significant gains recognized in the fourth quarter also adjusted out of the non-GAAP results as follows. A $93 million gain was recognized as a result of Inotera's equity GDR offering in May that was executed at a price above the carrying value of our investment. This gain was recognized in the fourth quarter, since we account for our equity method results from Inotera with a two-month lag. And $190 million gain was recognized from the sale of our remaining interest in Aptina to ON Semiconductor. The transaction closed just shortly before the end of the fiscal year. And finally, there is a 27 million share anti-dilutive effect of capped calls based on the average stock price during the fourth quarter of $31.91. In the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect the following non-GAAP adjustments. Between $40 million and $45 million for amortization of debt discounts on the convertible notes and the Elpida installment debt, we are anticipating a Q1 net loss on restructure of debt of approximately $25 million as the conversions of the 2031 B-notes are completed. Non-cash taxes related to the Elpida acquisition are expected to be between $20 million and $30 million in the first quarter. Also, the anti-dilutive effect of our capped calls will be based on the average share price for the quarter. Please refer to the convertible debt dilution table included in the earnings call data file posted on our Web site. Let's turn now to our results by technology and other guidance for the first quarter. On a consolidated basis we are guiding total revenue for the first quarter in the range of $4.45 billion to $4.7 billion. Recalling our first quarter of fiscal 2015, we will include an extra week due to the periodic adjustment of our weekly fiscal calendar to coincide with the end of August year-end, which will have a direct impact on operating expenses; however, revenue may vary differently. Turning now to DRAM, DRAM revenue increased nearly 5% compared to the third quarter, primarily due to an increase in bit sales volume and stable ASPs. DRAM gross margin remained in the high 30% range, with flat cost per bit. Cost per bit would have been down 2%, absent the effect of the Tessera license. Our reported income from equity method investments for the fourth quarter was $119 million substantially all of which is attributable to Inotera. DRAM gross margins for the first quarter using quarter to date ASP and projected mix for the quarter should be up a couple of points compared to Q4 based on bit production up mid to high single digits, ASPs up low single-digits, and cost per bit down low single-digits which includes the effect from the Tessera license in Q4. Key items affecting our DRAM guidance for the first quarter are continued favorable market conditions, like for like pricing, generally flat to up for PC and server DRAM and trending up for mobile DRAM, which Mark will comment on in a few minutes. On the Trade NAND side revenue increased 6% in the fourth quarter with a 13% increase in bit sales volume partially offset by 6% decrease in the average selling price. Trade NAND gross margin was in the mid-20% range down approximately 3 percentage points with ASP declines outpacing cost per bit reductions of 2%. However, absent the effect of the Tessera license agreement, cost per bit would have been down approximately 5%. Trade NAND gross margins for first quarter using quarter to date ASP and projected mix for the quarter, are expected to be down 1 to 2 percentage points compared to Q4, based on bit production is expected to be up high teens, ASPs down low to mid-single digits, and cost per bit down low single digits compared to Q4, which includes the effect of the Tessera license. Key trends for Q1 affecting this guidance are generally stable NAND market conditions, and also, strong growth in client and enterprise SSD volumes with more pronounced price competition and initially higher BOM costs that impact margins. Looking at other P&L and cash flow results and guidance, SG&A expense in Q1 is expected to be up slightly from the normalized weekly run rate from the fourth quarter. R&D expense in the first quarter and fiscal 2015 is expected to increase compared to the fourth quarter, even when normalized for the 14th week in Q1, due to higher volumes of development wafers processed for new technologies and new solutions development. The company generated $1.35 billion in operating cash flow in the fourth quarter and ended the quarter with $5.4 billion in cash and marketable investments approximately $1.8 billion increase over the fiscal year. Expenditures of property, plant and equipment in the fourth quarter of fiscal year were $1.3 billion and $3.1 billion respectively. Our cash tax rate continues to be in the low single-digit range at current profit levels. While GAAP taxes are expected to run in mid-single digits this year. Throughout this past fiscal year we've been in the market in each open trading window revamping the capital structure of the company with the focus on reducing dilution associated with our convertible notes. We've been repurchasing or converting convertible notes with cash and replacing them with high-yield notes including the fourth quarter repurchase of the 2032 notes and issuance of $1.15 billion and 5.5% notes. Approximately 90% of the free cash flow generated during the year was used for these dilution management activities. In addition, in the fourth quarter, we used $339 million of cash to prepay certain foreign loans and leases. We have indicated the pending conversion of the remaining 2031 B-notes will be for cash, resulting in an outflow in Q1 of approximately $390 million of cash. Now, I'll turn it over to Mark Adams for his comments.
Mark Adams: Thanks, Ron. I will begin, as usual, with a review of our Q4 operating performance by business units, as well as share commentary on market insights, key segment trends and memory industry dynamics. Our Computing and Networking Business Unit referred to as CNBU, had another strong quarter, achieving $1.9 billion in revenues in Q4. DRAM pricing in CNBU was up quarter-on-quarter, highlighting a continued healthy demand supply balance in computing, server networking and enterprise market segments. On the client side, we continued to receive strong demand signals from our PC customer base. We locked our pricing through the end of our calendar Q3 and with our three largest OEM customers, and have received interest in locking prices again for Q4. We achieved record revenue and bit shipments in our server segment. Server DRAM growth is being driven by customers adding more memory per system. In fiscal year 2014, we saw a 40% year-on-year growth in DRAM per server, while ASPs in the segment had strengthened over the same period. This growth in server based memory is based on increasing server workloads, continuing to require DRAM performance and density and is a great example of a high-growth segment with a demand profile that is not sensitive to price. Networking revenues in DRAM were up 19%, quarter-over-quarter. Demand for our networking products remained strong driven by LTE build-out in China and other emerging markets. Next year, we expect to see significantly more 4G handset sold utilizing this capacity, which continues to drive higher memory content per phone. I will address this more in the mobile section. The U.S. will fully be engaged in a 4G LTE build-out throughout calendar 2015 and as a result, we anticipate seeing continued strong demand in this area. Lastly, our Graphics business continues to flourish and increasingly contributes to an uplift in ASPs and margin. We're starting to see strong gaming consoles demand ahead of the holidays and remain optimistic for a good quarter and graphics. We are pleased with the progress on the technology innovation front in DRAM. We commenced early DDR4 shipments in Q4 as Intel officially launched DDR4 enabled platforms in early September, and Micron is validated with their entire 4 gigabit based portfolio. I want to recognize our R&D organization, our engineering teams and BU product development organization for positioning Micron as first to market and what we feel could be a strong value-added business. We are in qualification at major OEMs for both server and client opportunities for DDR4. We anticipate a significant price for those customers looking to differentiate their solutions. We have also launched into the non-volatile DIMM category providing for DRAM content back-up with dramatically improved reliability. Our NVDIMM product launch initially based on DDR3 is going well as we've received production orders from Tier 1 customers. We've also signed a lead major OEM customer for the launch of our DDR4 based NVDIMM targeting shipments in calendar Q2. Micron's hybrid memory cube continues to gain significant traction at leading network and server customers. In addition, similar technology for Micron will be used in Intel's Knights Landing platform for a high performance in low latency benefits in high-performance computing. Finally, our DDR5 product continues to gain wide adoption in gaming consoles and is also being sampled in high-performance networking applications. Our Storage Business Unit or SBU, recorded $907 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, up 4% quarter-over-quarter. We continue to make progress in both the client and enterprise SSD market. We set records for total SSD revenue gigabyte shipped and overall units in our fourth quarter, while also achieving record revenue for both client and enterprise SSD's individually. We increased client SSD shipments to Tier 1 OEMs by 23% quarter-on-quarter. For our fiscal 2014, SBU revenue was up 23% when compared to 2013, coming in at $3.5 billion. Gross margin dollars were up 17% year-on-year reflecting the overall health of the NAND market. We remain focused on improving the fundamentals of our NAND business as we believe there is upside to our performance relative to our competition in the coming quarters. I would like to discuss some of the elements which we feel can bolster our NAND business. First, we continue to invest in process innovation. We executed the fastest ramp in our company's history for our 256 gigabit, 16-nanometer planar product. TechInsights recognized Micron with a semiconductor product of the year award and most innovative memory device award for this technology. We're making progress in our 16-nanometer TLC product with engineering samples still on track for the end of this calendar year. We are targeting late spring shipments of TLC components to consumer applications and expect to be shipping a TLC client SSD drive into the market during our fiscal fourth quarter. Micron will continue to increase our leadership in overall NAND scaling with our 256-gigabit, 3D NAND device, which we believe will have the highest density per square inch of silicon in the industry. We remain on track for calendar Q4 samples and currently forecasting volume production by the second half of calendar 2015. Beyond innovation at the technology level, we continued to add controller and firmware resources that are helping to accelerate product development, enhance the quality of our PCIe SaaS and SATA-based SSD products led by the launch of our M500 DC enterprise product, which targets data center applications, our enterprise SSD revenue was up 79% quarter-on-quarter. This investment in system-level solutions has led new customer wins in server, network security, cloud and video streaming segments in Q4. In addition to chip and system-level investments, we continue to recruit strong level sales and marketing personnel to position our go-to-market engine for future success. We are investing and expanding our customer engagement support, it is increasingly becoming more of a design and custom solution type relationship with key accounts. Finally, we are continuing to diversify our NAND business and do more attractive end market applications. As an example, revenue for NAND sold in the mobile segment was up 18% quarter-over-quarter. Coupling NAND with DRAM in the form of eMCPs is a high-growth opportunity. eMCPs are essentially low power DRAM packaged with a managed NAND product all behind the controller. We believe this is solution, is a great example of the value of Micron's portfolio. We continue to grow share in our consumer products segments with Lexar-branded memory cards and USB products, gaining share in the U.S. and international markets. We remain bullish on the long-term market opportunity in NAND both in terms of the market outlook, and our ability to improve our operating performance. Upside potential in our NAND business will be driven by the chip level innovation including TLC and 3D NAND, investment in system-level capabilities, additional organization capabilities and focused execution on growth and diversifying markets. We are very pleased with the performance of our mobile business unit. MBU revenue came in at $909 million with a 22% operating margin. We continue to see strong demand in mobile. The iPhone 6 launch appears to be going quite well and reflective of consumer appetite for improving smartphone application features and performance. On the high-end, the Samsung Note 4 is now shipping with 3 gigabytes of low-power DRAM's is the Xiaomi MI4 product line as well. In NAND, the higher-end configurations have shifted from 32 gigabytes and 64 gigabytes now to 64 gigabytes and 128 gigabytes. We are currently forecasting NAND growth in the mobile segment of greater than 3X year-over-year for fiscal year 2015. The low to mid range price smartphone market is driven additional memory content as well, meeting the entry-level segment is evolving from phones with virtually no DRAM to new products such as the Android 1, which is 1 gigabyte of low-power DRAM. This is $100 smartphone targeting 5 billion users in emerging markets. We are focused on our diversified set of mobile customers and continue to balance our PC DRAM and mobile DRAM capacity to optimize for long-term profitability. On the product front, we are growing our managed NAND business with increased shipments of eMCPs as I mentioned earlier. The rapid adoption of eMCPs for the low to mid end smartphones, which is the fastest-growing segment today represents a unique opportunity for Micron. Our known good die flow from our MMJ fab formerly Elpida, coupled with Micron's industry-leading 16-nanometer NAND technology enables us to capture share due to the accelerating market shift from eMCP from eMMC. Over the next year, we are forecasting that roughly 25% of our overall mobile revenue will come from memory combined with the controller. We believe that companies like Micron, who have the portfolio of NAND and DRAM will have a distinct advantage in the long run in the mobile segment. In addition to managed NAND, we're currently working with our chip partners to enable low-power DDR4 for future qualification in high-performance applications for mobile. I want to congratulate the mobile team for their successful turnaround of the business that within last two years was losing money on the bottom line. We feel that the combination of increasing memory content and mobile devices and the declining rate of mobile industry supply growth due to the attractiveness of other relatively higher margin segments, lead to a healthy overall supply and demand outlook for mobile. We look forward to the teams continued strong execution. Our Embedded Business Unit or EBU set a record of $1.74 billion in fiscal year 2014 which represent 39% year-over-year growth. Our fourth quarter revenue of $476 million reflected a seventh straight quarter of record shipments for embedded. Automotive revenues were 40% increase year-on-year. The automotive segment continues to benefit from memory content growth fueled by both infotainment and advanced driver assistance systems. Our commitment to the unique needs of this market in areas such as quality, reliability, longevity and service has enabled us to strengthen our market leadership in Q4. The broad category of industrial and multi-market, otherwise referred to as IMM, achieved record revenue for both the quarter and the year. Year-on-year revenue growth was 10% to 20% driven by continued growth in factory automation, machine-to-machine systems and aerospace and defense. As we see strong demand growth in areas such as automotive entertainment consumer electronics, connected home devices and machine-to-machine systems, we remain bullish on our EBU performance for fiscal 2015. Operationally, we had a tremendous year. In a year where we shift to more diversified set of products with more complex packaging and custom configurations to a broader set of end customers, we were able to reduce overall inventory and drive our churns 18% higher compared to the end of fiscal year 2013. This is all the more impressive given the significantly larger revenue scale of our business than which we left 2013. Our DRAM and NAND front-end cycle times improved 25% and 18%, respectively, year-over-year. And our backend test and assembly facilities reduced their cycle times 33% and 34% for NAND and DRAM. We see additional room for improvement in our operations during fiscal year 2015. The pricing environment for our portfolio of products remains favorable. DC pricing has remained strong with more than 90% of our computing capacity tied to OEM contract pricing most of which with quarterly pricing agreements in place. This has been a positive effect on mobile pricing, as well, having balanced our production to take advantage of PC DRAM ASPs in margins which are currently above the mobile business. On the NAND front, pricing dynamics are relatively stable heading into the holiday build season. We remain bullish on the long-term outlook for NAND with increasing attach rates in both client and enterprise drives with a strong content move from 128 gigabytes systems trending upwards to 512 gigabytes systems, as well, seeing a big increase in phones. As the industry converged to 3D NAND, we think performance and cost will continue to improve driving accelerated adoption of NAND and client mobile and enterprise market segments. We see a bright future in NAND another emerging non-volatile memory technologies. In closing, I also want to congratulate our team for a great quarter and an outstanding fiscal year 2014. We look forward to a strong Q1 and we feel there is opportunity for improved performance in fiscal year 2015 as we continue to drive our memory solutions to higher value-added customers and segments. With that, I will hand it back over to Kipp.
Kipp Bedard: Thanks Mark. We will now take questions from callers. Just a reminder, if you are using a speakerphone please do pick up the handset when asking a question, so we can hear you clearly and please open up the lines.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of CJ Muse with ISI Group. Your line is open.
CJ Muse - ISI Group: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question is around DRAM pricing. You talked about greater share in terms of contract and increased duration. We'd love to get an update on what percentage is out two, three months and what kind of visibility you have into the new calendar year from where we are today?
Mark Adams: Well, I'm going to be careful about speculating too far out into the calendar year. My commentary earlier tried to address that we have our top three PC OEM customers on a three-month price increment that ends at the end of September, and the current indication is that we are going to have another discussion around and probably end on a three-month price increment for the calendar Q4 period, and as current market suggests we think those conversations will be in line with stable or slightly improved pricing.
CJ Muse - ISI Group: Okay, that’s helpful. And then on the cost side, can you provide an update on where you are on the DRAM 25-nanometer ramp, in terms of percentage output as you move into the November quarter and how we should think about that ramp beyond and the cost savings achieved?
Mark Adams: Okay. Yes. So, just for review purposes, we currently have 25-nanometer product coming out of Hiroshima, which is targeted primarily at mobile. And then we also have our Rexchip facility in production with mobile, 25-nanometer, as well aimed at mobile. Today, as we sit going into the quarter, 25% -- sorry, 25-nanometer product of DDR3 will be roughly about 25% in the quarter out of Hiroshima and in the mobile -- sorry, 50% in Hiroshima and out of Rexchip it will be roughly 25%.
CJ Muse - ISI Group: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Van Hees with Wedbush. Your line is open.
Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush: Good afternoon and congratulations on another great quarter and guidance. I was wondering if we could talk a little bit more about the DRAM business and what percentage is PC DRAM, server DRAM, and mobile DRAM, and then maybe within that we could talk about what's 25-nanometer and how that is shaping up?
Mark Adams: Sure. When you look at our DRAM business, today, the best way to think about it is mobile is roughly about 25% of overall DRAM. And, compute is roughly around 30% of DRAM. And then if you look at the specialty business, you asked about servers. Server is roughly just below 20%. Those are kind of the three areas you asked about.
Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush: Okay. Great. And thanks so much. That's very helpful. And as we look at the percentage of your DRAM mix today, how does that compare to last year at this time? And as you guys are looking for, you've been talking a lot about optimizing your mix, are we going to see a shift more to PC DRAM, which seems to be the better cost, lower-cost for you and better pricing advantage?
Mark Adams: Well, I don't think we are going – Betsy, I can tell you where we were last year. So, I said that compute was in the kind of mid to high 30%. It was slightly higher last year but still under 40%. Mobile was lower last year coming out of fiscal year 2013, but increasing as we left the year, and the server business it was slightly higher. By the way, the question on PC capacity and how we are optimizing, it is not just the mobile to PC dynamic, it's also some of the low-end of the server business that we shifted the capacity back to meet the demand of the PC business.
Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush: Thanks Mark. That's really helpful. And then my last question and I will jump out. It’s on DDR4, you talked about a very nice pricing premium. And I was wondering if you could give us kind of a range of what type of percentage pricing premium we are going to see? And then, as we are looking at DDR3 and the conversion to DDR4, how are you guys thinking that's going to play out over the next couple of years?
Mark Adams: It’s okay. We are not going to comment on the actual pricing premium. But suffice to say, our production decisions will be driven around our way and margin, not any market share build, necessarily.
Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush: Okay. Great. Thanks again and congratulations on a great quarter and guidance.
Mark Adams: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura Securities. Your line is open.
Romit Shah - Nomura Securities: Thanks and a great quarter. I just wanted to get your perspective on DRAM content in mobile. We are seeing the iPhone 6 use – one gigabyte of DRAM. Some people were expecting DRAM content to be higher. Just your perspective on that, is that just sort of specific to the Apple ecosystem because we are seeing in android DRAM content go up? Or, is it because DRAM pricing has gone up so much that key OEMs are now trying to minimize the amount of memory in the phone?
Mark Adams: I think it's a little bit of both, to tell you the truth. If you look at the overall category for the mobile segment, DRAM content per unit is up pretty dramatically. Yes, the Apple ecosystem is more efficient, but I also would suggest that given how tight the memory business is, there probably wasn't a lot of room for them to be able to address higher-end configurations.
Romit Shah - Nomura Securities: Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess just back to your outlook for 20% to 25% on bit growth, what is your assumption for mobile within that?
Mark Adams: As we mentioned on prior calls, we think that mobile will be about mid-40s next year in terms of percent bit growth. But, you also have to remember that we stated and will say again today, we are going to manage this from a balanced portfolio perspective and really look at the return piece of the business. In mobile as we said, we don't necessarily need to be the biggest supplier of memory. We want to be the most profitable supplier of memory in helping our customers innovate. And so it's going to be roughly in that area, but we will see over time how it plays out.
Romit Shah - Nomura Securities: And then just last question. Is there any revenue impact from the extra weeks?
Ron Foster: This is Ron. There should be and we contemplated that in our revenue guidance of $4.45 billion to $4.7 billion. Theoretically, you get about one seventh additional cost on OpEx and one seventh additional revenue and the COGS moves with the revenue. All I just add, is that at -- one 14th, excuse me 7%. All I'd add is that when it's on the revenue side, you don't necessarily get linear effect from adding one week to the quarter, where you have some customers who are polling from stock, et cetera, on a monthly basis, for example. But, in general, you can think of it that way, about a 7% lift.
Romit Shah - Nomura Securities: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs: Thanks very much for taking the question. I was hoping you could help us think a little bit about the free cash flow dynamics in our business. You talked about some of the CapEx increases that you are contemplating into your fiscal year 2015. Maybe you could up us think about your ability to also grow your operating cash flows and if you could talk to where the free cash flow margins are between your DRAM and NAND businesses?
Ron Foster: Sure. Mark, we don't specifically go through detail in terms of what our view in projecting the operating cash flow and free cash flow. We are giving you a view out one quarter. But, if you look at our current trajectories and the stability we are seeing right now on the marketplace, you can extrapolate that going forward and potentially see trend lines in the similar range. But, we don't give guidance beyond one quarter out. We have also given you the CapEx guidance and so, you have a view of that. It's up some from last year, $3.6 billion to $4 billion. But given current trajectories, we certainly have that – would have that well covered with operating cash flow. If you look at the DRAM versus NAND breakdown, we don't break out operating cash flow and free cash flow by technology. So, I don't have a view for you on that.
Mark Durcan: Mark, let me add just from a business perspective, clearly, we got a lot of margin opportunities to run our business. Mark talked about some of the pricing trends, I talked about kind of where we see supply going. Internally, relative to the execution, we talk about what we can do on the NAND side relative to adjusting our mix on TLC and eMMC, the mobile space, SSDs, et cetera. So we think we've got a lot of leverage in our business here and we are just very focused on executing what's a pretty good market environment.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs: I appreciate the perspective. For a follow-up, are you going to talk on the NAND business, specifically I know at the Analyst Day, you guys – in information conference you guys have talked about some improvements that you are expecting in NAND over the next two to six quarters. And I understand TLC for example is part of that. Can you just talk a little bit more depth about how you are progressing with that and maybe you could tie in to some of the comments you made in your prepared remarks on SSDs and how SSDs are impacting both pricing and cost and then the overall profitability levels of your NAND business as we think out over the next few quarters?
Mark Durcan: Let me turn it over to Mark Adams here in a second. Let me just -- on NAND, we will have 16-nanometer samples out in calendar Q4 for TLC. We will have TLC SSD in the marketplace in the summer, maybe slightly before that. And we continue to have pretty good growth in our penetration of planar SSD market as well as the mobile segment generally. Mark, do you want add any color beyond that?
Mark Adams: Well, I think it's important to know that in the cost curves in our NAND business, as SSDs continue to grow as a percentage of our overall NAND business. That will add cost of goods impact because we can get things like controllers and PCBs and rest of the building materials of SSD that go into our COGS calculation. Secondly, I'd like to emphasize that as you can see by the growth quarter-over-quarter, the last two quarters, market access is not a problem. Micron people are leaning on Micron to drive their planar SSD and enterprise opportunities. And we continue to invest in – these businesses are high-value businesses, they're not ones that you necessarily can develop overnight. We're very happy about the progress in the quarter, especially, as I mentioned, enterprise sales up 79% quarter-over-quarter, well ahead of market growth.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Because the first question I want to talk to a little bit about is the relationship with Inotera. Is that clearly providing a lot of CapEx and this moved to 20-nanometer, but you are providing a lot of the IP to help them get there. And I'm just kind of curious, as I think about the pricing arrangement of market minus, they're going to get pretty good cost savings with the move to 20 over the next year or so and probably grow bits at a much faster rate than the overall Micron DRAM business. How do I think about kind of your benefit on the gross margin line as they bring down their cost curve?
Mark Durcan: Obviously, it's a complicated relationship. By way of background, you're right. We provide a lot of advanced process technology products, customer access, customer service, a lot of things to the relationship. What we get back is the full output of Inotera the market minus transfer price. But we also get back equity gains on the bottom line. Without going into too much detail, John, the supply agreement it's a three-year agreement. It calls for annual renegotiation. And any changes to the agreement will be negotiated with the company between Micron and Inotera. And it's other major shareholders. We greatly value the strategic relationship with Inotera and Formosa and we intend to work closely with them to make sure that it's a long-term, sustainable relationship where each party gets a reasonable return, given what they are bringing to the relationship. And not much to add to that.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Got it. And then guys as my follow-up maybe for Ron. Ron, can you remind me again on the currency front, the yen dollar relationship? I think you've historically said every one point move is about a $5 million to $7 million hit to operating margins or benefit to operating profit, sorry. Is that still the correct way to think about it?
Ron Foster: Yes, John. In terms of the yen, which is moving a lot just very recently as we all know, and the comment was on operating spending or general spending -- yen-based spending. Today, our calculus is that our operating spend is impacted about – which is not just OpEx, but all of our yen-based cost of sales activities, too. Our impact is about $3 million to $4 million per one yen per quarter. Most of the yen-based spending is in COGS, actually, so the impact is delayed about a quarter based on their inventory flow through. So, you need to keep that in mind. We have a lower level of yen denominated costs today, especially now that we have converted MMJ to U.S. functional currency. And we also have a yen neutral balance sheet. So the metric used now is $3 million to $4 million per one yen change per quarter in our overall cost structure and we contemplated current levels of the yen in our guidance.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: And then Ron, if I could sneak a quick one in, the 30% of CapEx that's non-capacity related, how do we think about the depreciation schedule on that CapEx? Is it similar to the capacity related to CapEx, or is it different?
Ron Foster: The CapEx does not – you mean the infrastructure in our front-end backend? Yes, it's the same structure.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Perfect. Thanks guys. I appreciate it. Congratulations on the good results.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company: Yes. Thanks. And just echoing the congrats on good results and guidance. With respect to your outlook for DRAM supply growth next year, fairly favorable. Could you, perhaps maybe elaborate on what you are seeing with your competitors, or if you have a view on what your competitors are doing with their respective capacity? And kind of what your thoughts on their overall projection of supply and how they're managing DRAM supply, as well?
Mark Durcan: We don't have any better insight into what the competitors are doing than you do. We read what they say in their earnings announcements and then in the press, et cetera, et cetera. But what we understand, is that Samsung's had a relatively effective 20-nanometer ramp and pull forward some of the gains that otherwise we are going to have a little bit later in terms of bit production. And we have a sense as to what they're doing to replace wafers loss to the 20-nanometer conversion based on what we've read in analyst and market reports. And so we continue to believe that the supply growth is in that range, given those reported incremental wafers coming from all the various parties in the marketplace.
Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company: And in terms of your overall gross margins, the DRAM margins continue to kind of drift higher and the pricing commentary in DRAM is very positive. When do think we are going to start to hit an inflection point on the NAND gross margin? I know you talked about TLC kind of moving forward. What percentage you think of the output exiting next year will be on TLC, given the fact that there's a big cost delta between MLC and TLC? More specifically, on the NAND gross margins, what's your long-term view?
Mark Durcan: We are still very early in the ramp and deployment. I just mentioned, we'll have a component in the marketplace next calendar quarter, calendar Q4. So kind of depends on how successful we are with market adoption and what goes on in relative pricing in all the various markets we serve. We're still going to be looking at margins and long-term sustainability of that margin. But at least we'll be in a position to address those markets as we move through the year and we think we'll see some continued deployment.
Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company: Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee. Your line is open.
Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee: Hi, guys congratulations on a solid guide. Looks like your earnings are approaching $1 a quarter year pretty soon. I had two questions. On the DRAM side, how do you see the 20-nanometer mix ramp through 2015? And I will have the next question after you answer that. Thanks.
Mark Adams: So our DRAM ramp in 2015 won't be significant volume until the second half calendar year. So you should see some volume show up in Q4 of our fiscal year.
Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee: Got it. Okay. And on the NAND side, obviously, you are going to TLC and 16-nanometer. Can you look at the mix between client and enterprise on the SSD side, especially? How do you see that mix playing out? What's the mix today and how do you see that playing out next year, exiting next year? 
Mark Adams: Today, our mix is roughly two thirds to 75% client and another one thirds, 25% of the third enterprise. And we think, proportionally, that's in the ballpark a lot of it depends on market conditions and it would be tougher to forecast out that far and how much that would change from where it is today.
Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Gauna with JMP Securities. Your line is open.
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities: Thanks and nice quarter. I was wondering if you could give us an add idea of about how much of your DRAM capacity is moving through the spot market right now and considering these contracts for the next quarter in the PC market, how you feel about leaving some flex capacity for price changes? Thanks.
Mark Adams: Well, I mentioned in my script earlier, less than 10% of our capacity goes to the spot market in DRAM. And so the other way to think about is, greater than 90% go to OEM customers. That being said, as it relates to kind of how we see pricing in our willingness to hold tight, we feel pretty confident where pricing is going in the quarter. We see stabled out pricing and holding inventory and a lot of stuff, we have gotten it before. We are in this business to make money, it's a return decision. We are not looking to liquidate anything. We are in good shape and that's where we're going to act.
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities: Okay. I'm wondering, you made some comments on the strength you are seeing in the server market. And I'm wondering your thoughts on how and during that is, how much might be just the near-term benefit from upgrade the Romley upgrade cycle, are there legs to this going forward that you can see? Thanks.
Mark Adams: Yes. I think we think it's not – the argument that you just posed is that there's more server units being sold and our proposition is that there is more density, more memory bits going into every server. So if in fact, you are right, you will see even faster memory growth in the server segment. But, we're talking about people wanting to put more capacity in a relatively modest single digit growth server business today.
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities: All right. One more, if I could. I'm wondering when we get into the back part of next year and you've got your 16-nanometer TLC, where do you expect the competition to be and how do you expect your products to stack up versus that?
Mark Adams: It's hard for us to speculate because we are not inside those companies and their product discussions. But remember something, we have made significant investments and we are very excited about our 3D offering we talked about seeing some 3D production out towards the end of our fiscal year, calendar Q3 next year. And so, we think there's a good combination in our product portfolio in the second half of the calendar year, next year for consumer and mobile applications requiring 50-nanometer TLC as well as entry-level client devices. And we also are pretty bullish about our 3D development and efforts and we think we will have differentiated solution there on the high-end for -- high performance NAND solutions.
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities: Okay, great. Congratulations again.
Mark Adams: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Newman with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Mark Newman - Bernstein: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So actually, I had a question on little bit relating to mix and how that impacts gross margin. So it looks like enterprise NAND seems to be the biggest area, enterprise SSD seems to be the biggest area of growth right now. You said 79% quarter-on-quarter growth. Could you talk about how the – how much the gross margin is for enterprise SSD versus the rest of the business? And so, and how that might be impacting the gross margin going forward? And then, I have a follow-up question on your overall SSD business, both client side and enterprise side what percentage of that uses your own control versus some kind of external controller solution?
Mark Adams: So let me talk to the first question around enterprise and the effect on the overall business. Without giving too much away for competitive reasons, just to suffice to say that the enterprise SSD business is an above averaged gross margin business for Micron and we're continuing to develop products and try to maximize their opportunity there. So as we grow that business, it should have a positive impact, all things being equal. As relates to your second question about internal controllers, we continue to invest internally and resources for both the clients and enterprise market. Today, we have a hybrid development approach, which is primarily around in-house development for value-added controller systems and for the more commodity type products, we look and work with third parties. Now remember, that doesn't mean we don't add value, because we got firmware development test and all that that goes on in the background with these partners. If you are looking for a rough proxy, I'll ask, I will have Kipp to follow-up. But, my suspicion is, we are somewhere in the 70%, 75% of internal, external controllers, maybe closer to 80% and about 20% internal controller development. And we will follow-up, Mark with the exact numbers.
Mark Newman - Bernstein: That's great. Thanks for that Mark. And then on DRAM, any – considering the strong pricing guidance you gave for this current quarter we are going into right now, where is pricing strongest and how do think mix might be changing? I'm just wondering because PC DRAM pricing seems to be pretty strong and it seems to have higher margin than average, I understand, for DRAM. I wonder if that percentage of mix might change going forward and so how to think about that?
Mark Adams: But there is two components to that. There is the supply element, right, Mark? And then, the overall end market behavior in terms of demand. As it sits today, and we talked about this in prior calls, we have a certain amount of flex capacity to move between PC and mobile. And we probably haven't emphasized enough, we also have discretion to move some of that PC capacity and server capacity back and forth. Given the strength of the PC market, we've optimized around the PC market on a relative basis, remember we want to be in all three businesses for the long-term. As it relates to going forward, it's a tougher call in terms of trying to predict that. But PC strength clearly today is helping lift mobile pricing and server pricing and which led to pretty favorable results in the quarter.
Mark Newman - Bernstein: And so then just to follow-up, so why you do think pricing is strongest now. Do you think – we haven't really seen a huge increase in mobile DRAM prices, yet, like we have for PC DRAM prices. And I just wonder if you might see some further strength in mobile DRAM prices going forward.
Mark Adams: Well, I think that given how we've looked at our – what I say variable capacity – I think that's a distinct possibility, assuming demand plays out the way we think it will. We think – I think that mobile price is likely to trend stable to upwards in the quarter, given some of the new launches and some of the configuration density improvements.
Mark Newman - Bernstein: All right. Thanks very much and great quarter.
Mark Adams: Thanks Mark.
Kipp Bedard: Thanks Mark. Appreciate it. We would like to thank everyone for participating in the call today and our apologies go out to those that are still on the line.

And with that, I would now like to turn the call over to Mark Durcan. Mark?
Mark Durcan: Thanks, Kipp. We had another outstanding quarter benefiting from strong market demand as well as solid operational execution. Our revenue was just under $4 billion while gross margins were stable at 34%. We had very strong free cash flow at $880 million based on operating cash flow of $1.46 billion less CapEx of $576 million. I’d like to spend some time touching on a few key areas of focus as we wrap up fiscal 2014 and continue preparing for fiscal 2015 and our brief industry update. Ron Foster will follow with a financial summary. And before turning to Q&A, we will close our prepared comments with Mark Adams covering additional details of our operational performance and market conditions. Key focus areas for the management of the remainder of this year and for 2015 include completion of the planned 25-nanometer DRAM conversion, beginning the 20-nanometer DRAM ramp, this is critical to improving our relative cost position, active management of our DRAM product mix as we balanced servicing demand growth in categories such as server or mobile while also maximizing our margin profile across other long-term strategically important segments, continued execution of our ongoing and capital efficient 16-nanometer planar NAND conversion, investment in tools and engineering resources to support the initial deployment and ramp of our innovative 3D NAND technology, increased sales of 16-nanometer TLC NAND-based products, growth of a robust enterprise SSD product portfolio, continued development of our capability to deliver higher value system level solutions, including investments in advanced packaging and controllers and investment in newly emerging memory technologies to ensure we remain at the cutting edge of innovation. As you can tell, we do not plan to rest on our laurels. For 2015, as well as for the longer term, we will continue to be measured and prudent in our capital spending and we will also maintain flexibility to regulate capital expenditures based on the return profile of the investment, including of course the impact of any change in market conditions. And we will provide more detail on our specific CapEx plans at a later date, but as we work through finalizing our plans for 2015, it is notable that an increasing amount of our spend will be targeted towards non-supply related investments. These include investments for tooling and alternative memories, advanced test and packaging capability and additional system level product capabilities, including those for controllers and SSDs. We will also be aligning our Micron Memory Japan and Micron Memory Taiwan toolsets with other fabs around the world in support of enhanced operational efficiency. We have no plans to expand wafer production and we expect the big growth we generate from technology in calendar 2015 will be in line with growth for the market for DRAM, which we are forecasting in the low to mid 20% range and in line with growth for the market for NAND, which we are forecasting in the low 40% range. Our long-term outlook for memory industry conditions also remains favorable. The supplier base is consolidated in DRAM and stabilized in NAND and we believe that in both markets, the industry is in a stage of maturity such that each supplier has sufficient scale to compete. Driven by a slowing rate of technology migration, supply bit growth trends have stabilized at a level below historical average. There appear to be only limited additions of new wafer capacity on the horizon. Applications requiring memory continue to grow and our customer base continues to diversify. We remain committed to delivering differentiated and system level products to meet the needs of this increasingly interesting and valuable market. We continue to forecast long-term demand in line with or above supply for DRAM. Similarly for NAND, beyond 2014, we expect the industry’s supply growth to remain in a similar range. Although as 3D production becomes more predominant heading into 2016, we may see a slowdown in supply growth given the technology complexity and additional clean room space required. We expect long-term NAND demand to be in balance relative to the supply going forward. I will stop here and turn over to Ron and Mark before turning for Q&A.
Ron Foster - Chief Financial Officer and Vice President, Finance: Thanks Mark. Our third quarter of fiscal 2014 ended on May 29, we posted to our website a file containing the financial information I will cover, including GAAP and non-GAAP results, certain key metrics for the third quarter, as well as guidance for the fourth quarter. For the third quarter, we reported net income of $806 million or $0.68 per diluted share on net sales just under $4 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the third quarter was $913 million or $0.79 per share. Non-GAAP adjustments netted to $107 million or $0.11 per share in the third quarter and included the following: restructure charges in the quarter of $9 million were primarily related to idle charges associated with shutting down operations in Israel and Italy. Amortization of debt discount and other costs of $36 million in the third quarter include imputed interest on our convertible notes and the discount on the Elpida installment debt. The $16 million loss on restructure of debt arose from the conversion and repurchase of convertible notes in the third quarter. I will touch on this further in a few minutes. Non-cash taxes from the legacy Elpida operations were $49 million in the third quarter. Cash taxes for the year are in the low single-digit percent of pre-tax income range as previously indicated. Finally, there is a $38 million share anti-dilutive effect of capped calls based on the average stock price during the third quarter of $24.89. In the fourth quarter, we expect the following non-GAAP adjustments. We anticipate incurring restructure costs in the fourth quarter for employee termination benefits in the range of $15 million to $25 million primarily in Italy, approximately $40 million amortization of debt discounts on the convertible notes and the Elpida installment debt during the fourth quarter. We expect the fourth quarter results to include an approximately $90 million gain associated with Inotera’s GDR offering last month since it was executed at a price above the carrying value of our investment. As of the end of Q3, the carrying value of our 33% equity interest in the total value of Inotera was approximately $700 million compared to the market value at today’s trading price of approximately $3.8 billion. In addition, ON Semiconductor recently announced its pending acquisition of Aptina Imaging, of which we own an approximate 27% interest on a diluted basis. The transaction is expected to close either late in our fiscal fourth quarter or in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 and is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. We expect proceeds from the transaction of approximately $100 million. The carrying value of our interest in Aptina has been written down to essentially zero through the recognition of our share of Aptina’s losses over time. Accordingly, virtually all of the proceeds we received from the sale to ON Semiconductor will be recognized as a gain at the time of the closing. Non-cash taxes related to the Elpida acquisition of between $65 million and $75 million in the fourth quarter and also the anti-dilutive effect of our cap calls will be based on the average share price for the quarter. Assuming a $32 share price, this would equate to a reduction in diluted shares of 27 million. Please refer to our convertible debt dilution table, which is included in the earnings call data file posted on our website. Let’s turn now to our results by technology and guidance. DRAM revenue decreased slightly in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. Both average selling prices and cost per bit decreased in the low single-digit range resulting in relatively stable margins comparing the past two quarters. Like-for-like product prices were generally stable, but we did see a mix shift from mobile and computing into server products as we balance supply in line with customer demand. Our reported income from equity method investments for the third quarter was $135 million, substantially all of which is attributable to Inotera. If our share of Inotera’s income were recorded in our DRAM gross margin in the third quarter, DRAM margin would be approximately 5 percentage points higher. DRAM gross margin for Q4 using quarter-to-date ASP and projected mix for the quarter should be flat to up slightly compared to Q3 based on bit production up low single-digits ASPs are flat and cost per bits down low single-digits. The key items affecting our DRAM guidance for the fourth quarter are continued favorable market conditions in DRAM, overall stable DRAM volumes, however with higher volumes of mobile in anticipation of customer demand, stable server volumes and decreased volume in PC, and stable to slightly increasing costs of products coming from Inotera. Turning to NAND, on the trade NAND side, sales volume decreased in the third quarter with our shift toward SSD sales, which have a longer back end manufacturing cycle time. This also contributed to a slight increase in NAND work-in-process inventories. Trade NAND gross margins in the third quarter were stable quarter-over-quarter with generally flat mix adjusted prices and costs. Trade NAND gross margins for Q4 using quarter-to-date ASP and projected mix for the quarter are expected to be down a couple of points compared to Q3 based on bit production expected to be up low to mid-teens, ASP down low to mid single-digits and cost per bit flat compared to Q3. Key trends for Q4 affecting this guidance are stable NAND market conditions. We expect an increasing mix of high-density NAND sales at generally lower ASPs, but still reasonable margins and we get more bits, continued growth in client SSD volumes with some initially higher BOM costs that impact margins, and the effect of a legacy pricing arrangement with a customer that’s trending lower through the first quarter of 2015. On a consolidated basis, we are guiding total revenue for the fourth quarter in the range of $4 billion to $4.2 billion. Fourth quarter gross margins are expected to be adversely affected in the $30 million range by a last time sale of end-of-life legacy architecture products, not included in our DRAM and NAND guidance that I just went through. Looking at other P&L and cash flow results and guidance, the company generated $1.5 billion in operating cash flow in the third quarter and ended the quarter with $4.8 billion in cash and marketable investments, including $2.6 billion held by Elpida and its subsidiaries. Expenditures for property, plant and equipment in the third quarter were $576 million and we are on track to be within our guided range for the fiscal year now estimated to be between $2.8 billion and $3.2 billion, with over $1 billion of expenditures planned for Q4. Actual spending may vary based on the timing of payments and our tool receipts. Since the beginning of our fiscal year, we have utilized approximately $2.1 billion of cash to convert or repurchase $1 billion of face amount of convertible notes and to reduce the share dilution associated with our convertible notes. This represents approximately 83% of our year-to-date free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less CapEx. Our dilution management strategy has year-to-date eliminated approximately 89 million shares associated with our convertible notes assuming the stock price of $32. Specifically, in the third quarter, we used approximately $1 billion to convert or repurchase our 2014 convertible notes and a portion of our Series C and D convertible notes. In addition, the company unwound a portion of the cap calls to retire another 3 million shares. Collectively, these transactions in Q3 reduced fully diluted shares associated with our convertible notes by approximately 26 million shares at a $32 stock price. We intend to continue to opportunistically migrate our debt mix over time towards more straight debt with investment grade like covenants and rates and reduce our convertible debt. Now, with that, I will turn it over to Mark Adams for his comments.
Mark Adams - President: Thanks, Ron. On our last call, I introduced our new organization structure highlighted by the formation of four market-facing business units: computing and networking, otherwise CNBU; storage referred to as SBU; mobile, MBU; and embedded, EBU. I will review our performance in first quarter under the new structure and then end with some technology and operating highlights from our third quarter before handing it back over to Kipp. For comparative basis, we will use restated numbers for prior periods as if we operated under the new structure in the past. Our computing and networking business had a strong third quarter characterized by improving demand and favorable pricing. The PC market appears to be more favorable compared to prior industry forecast and supply remains constrained. Pent-up demand for corporate refresh on desktop and notebooks seems to be leading to better-than-expected sector performance. PC DRAM pricing is improving both at major OEMs and in the channel as current forecast remains strong for Q4 and through the holiday season. Demand for server DRAM is also increasing. Server bits were up 30% quarter-on-quarter driven by data center and enterprise growth in density per unit memory content leading to enhanced system level performance. Demand for our networking products remained healthy as well driven by LTE build-out in China and other emerging markets. Networking DRAM pricing improved quarter-over-quarter driven by richer mix of products and continued strong demand. Finally, our graphics business had record shipments and revenue in the quarter with strong sales of GDDR5 products driven by key OEM penetration both PC and console gaming. On the technology front, we continue to drive innovation with products such as DDR4 for servers and high-performance desktop applications; GDDR5 into high-performance gaming PCs and workstation graphics; and Hybrid Memory Cube for high-performance solutions in networking and computing. For example, DDR4 is in qualification at Tier 1 OEMs for both server and computing customers. We see initial DDR4 shipments in fiscal Q4 2014 and forecast that DDR4 will represent approximately 20% of CNBU DRAM output and close to 10% of our overall DRAM output in the second half of fiscal year 2015. As we projected on our second quarter call in April, Q3 represented a turnaround quarter for our storage business unit in overall SSD volume. We were able to drive customer qualification of our NAND flash capacity from our Fab 7 conversion, as well as launch our first 16-nanometer based products for key channels and customers. Revenues for client and enterprise SSDs each increased by well over 50% compared to our second quarter. We launched our first 16-nanometer client SSD drive, the MX100, at Computech and have received strong customer commitments out of the gate for a performance leader in the SSD value segment. We also see OEM growth with the M510 and M550 client drives and have a strong customer interest in terabyte-class client SSDs for immediate workflow, cloud and other applications, where a high reliability and performance coupled terabyte-class capacity and competitive pricing are critical. We launched the M500 DC SATA enterprise drive for data center applications and received a large volume commitment from a major search company to address their storage needs. We are aggressively working on our development of our 16-nanometer TLC roadmap in an effort to drive our overall NAND cost competitiveness. We expect to see component samples of our 16-nanometer TLC by the end of calendar year with client-based TLC SSD by spring of 2015. We continue to grow our controller and firmware organizations to help align our PCIe and SaaS roadmap to enterprise customer requirements. We believe our innovative 3D NAND technology will enable a highly cost-effective solution and a competitive advantage in high-performance applications. We remain bullish on the long-term market in NAND. We see opportunity for progress and feel the organization changes we have made, coupled with technology investments will enable us to drive improved results to the course of fiscal year 2015. Our mobile business had an outstanding quarter highlighted by an 18% operating margin in a business that just 12 months ago was underwater. We continue to focus our mobile business on generating maximum returns as opposed to simply market share growth. The team has done a nice job in balancing out the demand from our Tier 1 OEMs, while taking advantage of the more segmented opportunities in the Tier 2 China market. The low-power DRAM category remains favorable demand supply balance and our known good die business is constrained due to the growth in mid and high-end phones related to LTE builds for China. The mobile team has qualified eMCP products at key OEM customers and we are beginning volume shipments in our fourth quarter. We expect that eMCP and eMMC mobile products will scale significantly to approximately 25% of the overall mobile revenue in fiscal year 2015 compared to less than 10% today. We have also commenced sampling low-power DDR4 to our partners and chipset vendors and expect to see shipments towards the end of fiscal year 2015. Our embedded business had another strong quarter with revenues of $467 million and an operating profit of 21% driven by growth in DRAM, NAND and NOR product sales in the quarter. Revenue was up 34% year-over-year in the new embedded business classification. The automotive segment continues to benefit from memory content growth fueled by both infotainment and advanced driver assistance systems. Our commitment to the unique needs of this market in areas such as quality, reliability, product longevity and service has enabled us to grow our number one position in the market. The broad category of industrial and multi-market, otherwise referred as IMM, showed strong double-digit growth quarter-over-quarter in part fueled by the integration of connectivity and emerging machine-to-machine usage with industrial applications. We also saw strong performance in the connected home segment across all of our product categories. We continue to see strong sales growth in eMMC for embedded applications as well. With the sale of our NOR fab in Israel, our idle fab charges will wind down over the next couple of quarters and thus we anticipate improving gross margins for NOR going forward. It is worthy of note that when you factor in products such as SSD, mobile eMCP and eMMC as well as eMMC for the embedded market, a significant portion of our business is now packaged with a controller and in some cases with a NAND DRAM combination. We think this is a good example of how our business is evolving to more systems and subsystem-level solutions. We anticipate this dynamic to continue to be an increasing part of the new memory paradigm. Our manufacturing team had a tremendous progress in improving our overall operational competitiveness. Front end cycle time, across all products, have improved over 30% since the beginning of our fiscal year. In addition, we set a record of 15 days for time to mature (indiscernible) on our 16-nanometer to NAND technology. As our business continues to expand into diversified end markets such as enterprise, networking, mobile, automotive and gaming, we continue to invest in our test assembly and supply chain capabilities to support an expanding set of customer requirements. We have seen strong improvements in the throughput volume of an increasingly differentiated set of products in test and assembly in setting a record for assembly yields over 99% during Q3 as well as improved our online – on-time delivery performance despite a constrained memory market. Overall, the memory – the pricing environment for our products remains favorable. PC demand is better than expected in our mobile supply is constrained. In both cases, we have large customers looking to lock in long-term pricing and supply commitment from us. On the NAND front, pricing is relatively stable on a like-for-like basis despite moving our portfolio to higher density storage products in some cases with lower average ASPs. We feel this positions us better for the future in these critical growth markets for NAND. We also project dramatic improvements in our mobile NAND business with eMMC and coupled with DRAM and eMCP products for fiscal year 2015. In this segment, we can leverage our portfolio brand breadth of NAND and DRAM to drive the profitable growth. In closing, I want to congratulate our team for a strong third quarter performance. We remained bullish on the health of the overall memory market. Our product mix continues to evolve to solutions optimized to specific end-market needs and we continue to drive higher levels of efficiency and effectiveness. We look forward to a strong Q4. With that, I will hand it back over to Kipp.
Kipp Bedard - Vice President, Investor Relations: Thanks Mark. We would now like to take questions from callers. Just a quick reminder, if you are using a speaker phone, please pickup the handset when asking a question so that we can hear you clearly. And with that, please open up the lines.
Operator: Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead sir.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Yes, good afternoon guys. Can you hear me okay?
Mark Durcan: Yes.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Perfect. Guys, a quick question here first on the DRAM front. I am just kind of curious when you look at the pricing in the fiscal third quarter and the guidance in the fiscal fourth quarter, I would have thought just given pricing trends in the industry, and more importantly, some of the mix drivers for you like DDR4, that you would perhaps have seen better pricing on the DRAM side of the business. Can you just help me understand a little bit about what’s happening on the mix side that’s driving the guidance for sort of flat pricing for the fiscal fourth quarter? Thanks.
Mark Adams: Well, I think as you have identified, it really is obviously all mix-driven for us. Some of which is related to some of the specialty markets lagging in the pricing catch-up relative to the PC segment. One of the things we have stated on prior calls is that each of these businesses is obviously very unique with a unique set of customers and we are committed to all the markets. We have seen tremendous server growth and we expect that to continue to improve over time, but in general what we are just seeing is a mix effect drive, basically a stable pricing relative to where we are today.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Thanks Mark. That’s helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up, guys, just on the ramp of the 16-nanometer TLC and NAND, as that happens over the next couple of quarters, can you help us or help me get a better understanding of the magnitude of the cost savings? And maybe you can talk about, if you had an optimal mix of TLC today, how much better would the profitability be in the business at the operating or gross margin level?
Mark Adams: Yes. I mean, a range to expect on TLC at a bit level somewhere between a 15% to 20% improvement. And as we are not specifying the actual table, we look to be in the market not just with components in the early part of the calendar year, but we should have a strong SSD play in the later part of the first half.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Perfect. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Cassidy from Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel: Thanks for taking my questions. You have mentioned long-term commitments, can you say how long those – the long-term is, is it six months, is it a year?
Mark Adams: Right now, the commitments we are looking at somewhere between 90 days and six months. And mind you, we are pretty careful about this, because these agreements have to be favorable for us over the long-term and so we have to lock in both the capacity supply piece of it as well as the pricing. And so we do these where we have confidence that the long-term relationship will drive the right behavior between both parties.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel: Okay, great. And maybe on the follow-up, you had mentioned that DDR4 was going to become 20% of the CNBU’s shipments in the second half of 2015. Is that at the cost of PCs or I guess is it just the mix shift you are making?
Mark Adams: It’s really going to start out more in server upfront. And we will only do this and our current plan has us generating higher margins in this DDR4 category and we will – we certainly won’t do it, if it’s margin adverse. And we feel pretty confident we are going to drive differentiation with our customers and allow them to drive performance. And so right now that’s where our plan has and we feel pretty confident we are going to drive to that result.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Fox from Cross Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Steven Fox - Cross Research: Thanks. Good afternoon. Just one clarification first on the potential long-term agreement, so are you saying that you have locked some in or are planning to and what kind of commitment would that be relative to your overhaul capacity?
Mark Adams: We have locked some but not a majority. And we have looked at each of them on their own merit in terms of the value of the relationship that we are able to drive in terms of portfolio of our products as well as market access.
Steven Fox - Cross Research: Okay. And then just a little bit more color on maybe the mix trends that play out beyond this quarter, can you just sort of talk about how you think maybe between now and year end some of the mix relates to specifically on the enterprise side? So server DRAM and enterprise SSDs, what is your outlook for demand from those areas for say through December 31?
Mark Adams: We still are very bullish on enterprise DRAM opportunities for us. And if you look at the server bit growth, I mean, I don’t have the exact number in front of me, but within the last two years, we were somewhere on the 150 million gigabit equivalents per quarter. I just stated that we were up 30% quarter-over-quarter, that was slightly below 500 million gigabit equivalents and that continues to grow in the server DRAM business and we think it’s going to continue to grow. Really, the density per box is a big differentiator in terms of performance. And we also think the hyper scale cloud and data center growth is just going to continue for the foreseeable future. And the enterprise business, we obviously continue to see growth there as well in the end markets. We also see that we feel it’s early. And there is different formats. There is hybrid drives, there is obviously SaaS and PCIe and we think we are at the beginning of a long game there with a lot of exciting opportunities and we continue to invest that way.
Steven Fox - Cross Research: So, is it fair to say that the mix in those two areas that you just pointed out should be higher by the end of the year versus where it is midyear?
Mark Adams: Let me jump in a little bit on the server piece. Clearly, there is very strong demand there and we have been – we have had more than our fair share of that segment in the market for long time based on service levels and quality levels etcetera. As we look at each of these segments though, as Mark has commented, we are going to be careful to make sure that we are looking at the long-term ramifications of the relationship with all those customers as well as optimizing our margins going forward. So, it’s not just a matter of growing share in the fastest growing segments, it’s a matter of balancing that with the return for the company as well.
Steven Fox - Cross Research: Great. I appreciate the color. Thanks again.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Mehdi Hosseini - SIG: Yes, thanks for taking my question. Starting with NAND, I am a little bit surprised that the cost is tracking flat for two consecutive quarters can you please provide an update? Is it just the matter of timing before 16-nanometer kicks in or how should we think about this progress?
Mark Adams: Well, thanks for the question. I think you identified one element to the equation. The primary driver, as I mentioned in my comments earlier was that we started to get back into the SSD game in scale and as that BOM cost includes all of the SSD build material, so that impacts cost that we classify under NAND as well as what you mentioned is that the – while going very well, we don’t set to get the full cost benefit until future quarter.
Mehdi Hosseini - SIG: So, how should we think about or how do you differentiate between the debt cost versus non-debt costs? Which one is having more of an impact?
Mark Adams: We tend to not want to give that data from a competitive perspective. It is just with the best way to take a look at it is to take a look at quarter-by-quarter the volume on SSD and how that might trend relative to cost per gigabit.
Mehdi Hosseini - SIG: Got it. And then one question for Ron, thanks for providing guide. I just needed clarification on gross margin. Did you say that gross margin would be down by $70 million and if so can you explain again what the reason is?
Ron Foster: Mehdi, what I broke was that I gave you the DRAM outlook including the margin trend and the NAND outlook including margin trend. In fact just to comment on that for a minute and then I gave you another piece which I will elaborate on. On the NAND margin trend, we actually indicated we were going to probably be down a couple of points Q2 to Q3 and we are actually flat. We are now thinking we will be down a couple of quarters predominantly mix driven, just so you know where that tie-in comes. But as you look at the total Q4 trend, we gave you the DRAM pieces, the NAND pieces where we think will be down a couple of points. And then there is a $30 million effect related to some expected sell-through of legacy technology inventory in the fourth quarter. And that will be basically – float out in the third quarters, but I wanted to call that out, because it’s a somewhat unique effect. It’s a technology required from our Numonyx acquisition and we will be replacing that with new emerging technology over time, but we did have some legacy inventory that we are selling off and that’s related to a specific approach to phase change that we are no longer pursuing in favor of other variance of the technology. So that $30 million is in addition to the guidance on NAND and DRAM I gave you.
Mehdi Hosseini - SIG: Got it. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Rajvindra Gill from Needham & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company: Yes, thanks for taking my questions and congrats on solid results. Just a question on the SSD strategy, given some of the recent consolidation or acquisitions that you have seen from your competitors, wondering what’s your response to that and how do you intend to kind of compete on the enterprise SSD space, given this recent acquisition and consolidation by your competitor?
Mark Durcan: Yes, so this is Mark. There has been ongoing activity in this area over a number of quarters, including as you know the most recent one. We continue to grow our businesses methodically and organically as well as look at a number of inorganic opportunities over time. When we see one that we think is a good fit for Micron, we will execute on it, but we are not going to comment in advance on which ones those might or might not be and we are certainly not going to comment on acquisitions by any of our competitors.
Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company: And it was pushed a little bit on the previous question, but can you talk a little bit about some of the tangible tailwinds you see on the NAND gross margins over the long-term? And how do you expect to get those NAND margins up, whether perhaps closer to some of your competitors?
Mark Adams: Yes, sure. So, firstly, as I commented on, we think the enterprise market is a very attractive market for the enterprise storage devices and continue to make investments in building out capabilities around our controller team, our firmware team. We have had a very good entry in the PCIe enterprise storage class products and great performance there and we continue to grow and continue to invest in SaaS as well. So, we believe that we will grow that business accordingly and be successful in that business. Secondly, as I commented on my earlier comments, we are continuing to drive and accelerate to a TLC roadmap that takes advantage, the cost advantages there. And I would say finally, we believe that beyond SSDs, the mobile market for NAND will be a good contributor for overall margins over the long-term and that’s really how we collectively look at this business. We are in this business for long-term. We are going to make these investments and drive overall, our capacity strategy and end-market product roadmaps that way.
Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Monika Garg from Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities: Thanks for taking my questions. First is on the CapEx, CapEx has almost doubled quarter-over-quarter, so could you kind of give a split between NAND, DRAM or is it more be weighted towards 3D NAND?
Mark Durcan: For the year of fiscal ‘14, the number that I gave you was 2.8 to 3.2, that’s over $1 billion of capital fourth quarter as you have observed. It’s just timing of payment schedules, but within the range that we have been guiding for a number of quarters now. And in terms of the breakdown, it’s heavier to DRAM. It’s probably 40% DRAM, 30% NAND and the remainder in a bunch of other areas, including R&D.
Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities: Thanks. Just then a question on the 3D NAND, could you maybe talk about when you expect to have samples of 3D NAND? And when do you think you will ramp 3D NAND basically conversion from 2D NAND to 3D NAND? Thanks.
Mark Durcan: Yes, Monika, we are not – we have commented on previous call that we would have more to say about that later in the year and we are not planning to make any announcements as to explicitly when we might sample or announce any products in that area. We have said that we believe that this is going to be a material impact on the industry in the second half of 2015 and we wouldn’t change that guidance today.
Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities: Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from C.J. Muse from ISI Group. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
C.J. Muse - ISI Group: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question is a follow-up. On the 3D NAND side, curious as you think about some of the well-known I guess issues there at one of your competitors, curious how you think about supply demand heading into next year and whether or not the industry will need to add incremental planar capacity to meet expected demand if the issues around 3D persist?
Mark Adams: It’s probably hard to speak for our competitors in that way, but I would say that our intent is to keep going down the path we are. We have stated in Mark’s comment we have got a plan in place that we are not making any changes to that plan today and as we look at industry demand over that period, we will consider matching up our customer requirements, but in general, we are on a plan with the current 3D strategy is not going to really affect our planar output.
Mark Durcan: Yes. And I think it’s – let me add a little bit to that, Mark, it’s really hard to look at the NAND business today and the changes coming with 3D NAND technology and say makes a lot of sense to make large investments in planar NAND. So, I think to the extent some of our competitors have issues with 3D NAND technology. I wouldn’t expect to see anybody go in and backfill out with incremental planar NAND, I would just expect the market to be a little tighter as competitors work through that situation.
C.J. Muse - ISI Group: That’s helpful. And I guess as a follow-up to your prepared remarks regarding system-level investments, curious, I guess first, if you can opine on I guess where on the technology side, whether controller, firmware, etcetera that where you think you might need incremental technology as well as whether you would pursue partnerships or whether it would be pure organic or acquisition driven?
Mark Durcan: This is just a big, big space to cover. When you start think about stores and all the places it goes and all the end applications and interfaces you have got, you got mobile applications, you got client, you got data center, you got hardened enterprise, you got UFS, you got PCIe, you got SaaS, you got SATA, it’s a lot of engineering resources across a broad spectrum to service all those system-level solutions. And so the answer is yes, all of the above. Micron needs incremental controller resources in all those areas, firmware and software resources to support those incremental controller resources and we are working at all of those areas both organically and inorganically and will continue to do that. So, stay tuned, but we are not going to broadcast in advance exactly what we may or may not do.
C.J. Muse - ISI Group: Sure. If I could sneak in one last one, can you provide an update on where you are in terms of shrink on the DRAM side, 25-nanometer and 20-nanometer, in terms of I guess this year or next year?
Mark Adams: Sure. So, today, as you know, we have got 25-nanometer product, about roughly 30% of our mobile DRAM is on 25-nanometer. Today, very little is in the PC DDR3 space on 25-nanometer. Going forward, obviously that will shift and improve in terms of the mix on the 25-nanometer node. And remember, as Inotera has probably stated, they are going to bypass 25-nanometer and go directly to 20-nanometer and we expect – and we can’t speak to them, but we expect them to be out in the early part of 2015 with early volumes and customer qualification and meaningful volumes in the back half of 2015. And then over time, we will begin the migration of our capacity that way as well.
C.J. Muse - ISI Group: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Freedman from RBC Capital. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital: Great. Thanks for taking my question guys and congrats on the strong results. If I could dig into the CapEx increase just a little bit more on the quarterly spend rate, Ron, you did say it had to do with the timing of payments. How should we think about that equipment getting turned on? And is there an inflection at all in the bit growth that we should see in maybe the Q1 quarter as that equipment gets put in place?
Ron Foster: Yes. So, it’s just mainly timing quarter-to-quarter and variation, but the way we normally recognize CapEx is when we pay it. So, when we actually pay it per vendor agreements. And typically, those vendor agreements have qualification process just to enable them to be available for production. So, it’s a function of when they are available for production and we pay according to our vendor agreements. So, yes as we go forward, that will certainly contribute to what Mark and Mark have been commenting about with bit growth trends over time as well as migrating some of the new product technology areas, but it can vary based upon the qualification scheduling of the technologies and the individual machines. Keep in mind as Mark also mentioned, we have got a number of investment going on in other areas such as 3D NAND technology and it has a little bit different timeline etcetera. So, there is a lot going on inside, Micron. The timing, quarter-to-quarter, tends to vary around, but I gave you the full year view and that was about where we thought we would be for the year, just some slipped out of the third quarter into the fourth, a little bit more than planned.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital: Okay, great. Thanks for that color. And it’s a great segue into my next question. There is a lot going on between all the different technology transitions you guys are doing. When we merged Micron and Elpida, we really did not see much in the way of any R&D synergies. Is there a point in time at which maybe the R&D roadmaps start to come together and joint development efforts might increase, such that we should see maybe some synergies be realized on the R&D lines? Is there anything that we should be thinking about there?
Mark Durcan: Well, I don’t want to forecast too far in the future, but Doug, I think you have identified a potential benefit downstream as we remember, Elpida was on a roadmap to 25-nanometer upon the acquisition. And we have obviously continued in parallel with the 20-nanometer investment on the R&D line. I think out in the future as the market warrants and dictates from a financial return perspective, you can envision us getting to a single architecture out beyond 20-nanometer.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital: Okay. And with that would that – and that could lead to some sort of an R&D synergies?
Mark Adams: Potentially.
Mark Durcan: Yes, it could, Doug, but keep in mind we are also making investments in storage-class memories and advanced system-level solutions etcetera. So, I think the nature of R&D is going to change. We are not as focused on driving that R&D line down as we are making sure that we are deploying whatever capital we do spend or whatever corporate resources we do allocate to R&D that we use them effectively and efficiently.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital: Alright. And if I could sneak one more in, can you talk a little bit about the wafer output that you are going to see in the back half of the year, maybe in a percentage Q3 over Q4 and then going forward and whether those are internally or purchased from Inotera?
Mark Durcan: I think the best way to characterize that, we see that as generally flat quarter-over-quarter.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital: Great, thank you. Congrats on the strong results.
Mark Durcan: Thanks, Doug.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Newman from Bernstein. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Mark Newman - Bernstein: Hi, thanks and congrats for the good results again. Question is more on the NAND side, it seems like, if you talk about – you are talking about a few things going on there, it seems like you are having some success on the SSD side. But from what I understand, it seems like the TLC part of the equation seems to be getting pushed out a little bit. So, I just wanted to check with you in terms of those two things, the movement towards more SSD solutions, what has worked and what are the kind of stumbling blocks for moving further, in terms of getting more SSDs, enterprise, end-computing PC SSDs out of the door to improve your mix? And similarly, on the TLC side, what is it that is delaying TLC adoption? Did you foresee those things being fixed? And if you could talk specifically through if those are more controller-related or silicon-related on the TLC?
Mark Adams: Well, maybe I could start with the question on market access and what we think is working. Remember, there are two dynamics that were going on over the last two quarters. So, when I commented on in the April call about this, one of which is we were obviously converting new capacity to NAND in our Singapore Fab 7 and that material need to get qualified with our major customers. In addition, we were also shifting from 20-nanometer and 25-nanometer drives to new product development on 15-nanometer and 20-nanometer high end drives. That transition at the time of the Singapore fab slowed our growth not necessarily driven by market growth, but driven by our ability to get customers quals and our products ramped at the right time. You saw the improvement in Q3 and that’s really – it should highlight that our access to the market is pretty strong. Our customers are relying and we drove pretty good results, but so it wasn’t something that I would say that we change behaviorally, it was just some transition in both technology and where the capacity was coming from. And we feel pretty confident we will continue to grow. On the TLC side, I would say that we are now confident with our internal testing that we can drive high capacity TLC into solid-state market. We were also positioned as a performance even on the client side, a high-end performance high-quality drive with our OEM customers and we want to make sure we were able to drive the right volume and the investments in TLC. And we think with our 16-nanometer roadmap we can do so, and as I said, as I commented earlier, we will get there probably by – from a drive format by spring of 2015.
Mark Newman - Bernstein: So, on the TLC side, are those more things or improvements on the controller side or is that also a combination to the NAND silicon itself?
Mark Adams: I think it’s a little bit of both. The controller piece has to handle obviously the error correction element of TLC and that’s a little bit different, but I think the reliability of the TLC and the actual testing of it internally in our development, early stage modeling has got us to higher comfort level.
Mark Newman - Bernstein: And then just a follow-up on the SSD portion of the question, have you shared or maybe I missed the percentage mix of your NAND that is going into SSDs? And then if that’s also broken out into enterprise versus PC as well by any chance?
Mark Adams: Yes. I am happy to do that. And let me just clarify, in the past we have actually included in our SSD revenue capacity we have sold to third-party SSD companies. And we are no longer going to do that. The best way to think about our SSD share today is that of overall NAND, SSD is roughly about 20% and that’s up from 12% last quarter. And again for competitive reasons, I just don’t want – I don’t feel comfortable breaking out the enterprise client mix.
Mark Newman - Bernstein: Okay, great. So, it’s from 12% to 20% and….
Mark Adams: Of our overall NAND revenue.
Mark Newman - Bernstein: Overall NAND revenue got it. And that’s purely your own SSDs, not accounting going to third-parties?
Mark Adams: That’s right. That’s right.
Mark Newman - Bernstein: Great. And is that – any idea where that may go to fiscal Q4 and into next year in terms of percentage of mix?
Mark Adams: Well, I think it’s fair to say that it will continue to grow. We don’t want to set any numbers on the call, but it will be an upward growth from here.
Mark Newman - Bernstein: Yes, I guess, all of this sounds good. I am just still a little bit curious why based on the guidance the next quarter’s gross margin looks like it’s going to come down, even with your mix improving SSDs. It seems like the ASP part of the line would be a little bit better, is there anything I am missing as to why that ASP wouldn’t be better?
Mark Adams: It’s really a function of our growth and our scale on getting big in some OEM sockets in terms of the SSD qualification and future business commitment. And the second piece on the margin question, as I mentioned, we are now getting 16-nanometer in volume obviously and that ramp is on the front end of the cost benefit curve that we would see in future quarters.
Mark Newman - Bernstein: Got it, okay. Much appreciated. Thanks very much.
Mark Adams: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh from Sterne. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Vijay Rakesh - Sterne: Yes, hi guys. Just going back on the same NAND question here, when you look at the SSD mix going from 12% to 20%, you mentioned some of the frontloading of the costs. As those costs flow through the August quarter, do you see NAND margins kind of bouncing back towards the end of the year into the November quarter?
Mark Adams: Well, it’s again we try to avoid forecasting going into that kind of out in the future. We will continue – guys, we are going to continue to drive performance in this business. And we think we have got line of sight on the key fixes to drive better performance over the long-term.
Vijay Rakesh - Sterne: And when you look at the 16-nanometer mix on the NAND side, where are you now and how much of the SSD goes to 16-nanometer, as you look out towards the end of the year?
Mark Adams: Okay. So, in terms of where we are in terms of leading-edge production for NAND, we are relatively light relative to we were 3% in the prior quarter and roughly of more or less, less than 20% in the – in Q4 we are projecting on 16-nanometer. So, we are still ramping the technology in this product and SSD is probably behind that as an overall mix.
Vijay Rakesh - Sterne: Got it. Last question, I mean, when do you see those cost improvements on the 16-nanometer start to flow through? When do you start to see that manifest on the margin side?
Mark Adams: Yes. Probably, the best comment I would say is that out in the early calendar ‘15.
Vijay Rakesh - Sterne: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Kipp Bedard: I think we have time for one more caller.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley: Great, thank you. Now that the transition in Singapore from DRAM to NAND is mostly behind you, can you talk about how you feel about the DRAM NAND mix today and what would drive you in the next few years to make further changes to change that mix?
Mark Durcan: Well, we feel pretty good about where we are at. We certainly are long-term believers in the growth of NAND demand. And as we learn more about what the elasticity of demand there is, I would think that it’s more likely that market is going to outgrow the ability to service it with existing capacity than it is in DRAM. And so while we are pretty happy with our mix today we don’t think in terms of flipping capacity back and forth on a go forward basis. I think we are kind of at least under today’s conditions happy with the mix we have got and we will look at dialing our mix between different segments within NAND and DRAM and we will look over time at having the right capacity. More likely, that’s going to be in NAND and DRAM as we move through time.
Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley: Okay, great. Thank you. And then separately, you talked about the potential benefits in moving to more straight debt at investment grade, what would be the change that would gauge the timing of that? And what, it seems like your bonds are trading pretty well now like how do you think about that potential opportunity?
Ron Foster: Sure, Joe. Obviously, the market is pretty favorable right now with regard to straight debt. We did one of the early offerings in our rating class for high-yield debt and it turned out extremely well. We basically got an investment grade covenants and very close to investment grade pricing. Since that time, the market has got even better. We never know how long that will hold, but it’s a very good environment today especially for Micron. So, we will be watching it closely and making moves as we think they are prudent over time in terms of our overall mix. But as I mentioned in general, we will be trending towards more high-yield given the current condition in rates and pricing and less in convert. We will continue to move on those over time as well to reduce them.
Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley: Okay, thank you.
Mark Durcan: Thank you, Joe.

Mark Durcan: Thanks, Kipp. I’d like to start today with an overview of the key developments during the quarter, followed by a few strategic and industry thoughts and then I’ll turn it over to Ron for a financial summary. And before turning to Q&A, we’ll close with our prepared remarks with a few comments by Mark Adams covering additional details of our operational performance and market conditions. We had another outstanding quarter benefiting from a favorable industry structure and market conditions as well as solid operational execution. We achieved record revenue of over $4.1 billion. Our gross margin improved to 34% and our earnings per share improved sequentially on both GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We had very strong free cash at 85 million based on operating cash flow of 1.39 billion with CapEx of 562 million. The Company’s focus is to drive operational excellence, deliver differentiated and system level products to diverse market segments and manage capital allocation all with a goal of maximizing long-term shareholder returns. Ron and Mark will cover some specifics related to our execution in these areas. I believe we’re executing well on multiple fronts, but we still have room for improvement in others which we will also discuss. Our outlook for memory industry conditions remains favorable. We believe the current industry structure is fundamentally changed and we can now manage our business focused on return based capital and supply decisions which was not always possible in the past. In terms of DRAM, it appears that Hynix’s Wuxi fab is back online and it supplies in the market. Low supplier and customer inventory across multiple segments coupled with our reduction in DRAM capacity as we convert Singapore to NAND has led to an overall stable supply situation, and we continue to see favorable market conditions in what is generally a slow seasonal period. We expect to see DRAM industry wafer production down at mid-single digits in 2014 as a result of DRAM to NAND conversions and the ongoing increase in process complexity as geometry shrinks. We expect total industry bit supply growth in the low to mid 20% range for 2014. This is slightly lower than our prior estimate. Beyond 2014, we expect similar year-over-year industry supply growth in the 20% to 30% range driven by relatively stable wafer output coupled with slowing process technology migrations compared to historical trends. We continue to forecast five-year DRAM demand CAGR in the mid 20% to 30% range which implies continued favorable market conditions and likely a reduction in volatility compared to historically DRAM trends. For NAND, we’re projecting industry growth in the low 40% range for 2014. This includes an increase in industry wafer production of just over 10% with the remaining supply growth coming from technology. We expect 2015 to be in a similar range, but we could see a reduction in the growth rate beyond 2015 as 3D production becomes more predominant and there is a subsequent reduction in wafer output given the additional cleaning space required for 3D NAND. We are forecasting a five-year NAND demand CAGR in the high 30% to low 40% range. As you’ve seen recently in NAND additions to industry capacity can cause volatility in the market given the challenge of matching long-term capacity decisions with short-term demand trends. However, we’re very bullish about the future of NAND Flash and we believe that this will be a very healthy market. There are strong demand drivers and elasticity to drive rebalancing. Micron NAND process technology positioning remains strong, during the quarter, we continue to make progress on ramping yields of our 20 nanometer and industry leading 16 nanometer technologies. The product team has also delivered some exciting new products and innovations to our customers including the market’s best performing PCIe SSD solution. We’re taking steps to better enable our high performance MLC and SLC components in value-added segments and sockets such as enterprise SSD and mobile eMMC in automobile applications and continue to add resources and controller firmware, software and packaging technologies to support this effort. Relative to Micron Memory Taiwan formally known as Rexchip in Taiwan, and since the end of last quarter, we’ve been engaged in the purchase of residual shares not previously owned by Micron. As a result of these additional purchases, today we have purchased all but about 0.5% of the outstanding shares. Total consideration paid for the incremental 10.6% of the company was approximately US$145 million. Finally I’d like to update you on the litigation matter related to Inotera. As you may recall, in the fall of 2008, Micron purchased Qimonda shares of Inotera. In January of 2011, the trustee for the Qimonda bankruptcy proceedings filed suit against Micron in Munich seeking among other things to undo the share purchase agreement from that transaction and to get the Inotera shares transferred back to the Qimonda stake. On March 13th we received the decision from the Court in Germany. On one hand the decision rejects the trustee claim for the alleged value of participating in the Inotera JV. On the other hand, a part of the decision that is intermediate and not yet enforceable would require Micron Semiconductor, BV to retransfer the purchased Inotera shares to the Qimonda stake. The Court also determined that the patent cross license agreement that was entered into at that time is cancelled. There will be an update to the litigation discussed in our 10-Q but since the material portions of the decision are not currently enforceable, nor in our view probable. There are not any material adjustments to our second quarter earnings. We believe the Court’s findings against us are wrong and will of course appeal. In conclusion let me confirm, we are very pleased with the results of the quarter and the outlook for Micron and healthy memory industry dynamics. We remain focused on optimizing value for our shareholders and worldwide customers in 2014 and beyond. I’ll stop here and turn it over to Ron and Mark before returning for Q&A.
Ron Foster: Thanks Mark. Our second quarter of fiscal 2014 ended on February 27th, as is our practice, we posted to our Web site a file containing the financial information I will cover including GAAP and non-GAAP results, certain key metrics for the second quarter, as well as guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. For the second quarter, on a GAAP basis, we reported net income of 731 million or $0.61 per diluted share on the second sequential quarter of record net sales of $4.1 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the second quarter was $989 million or $0.85 per share, which is $108 million higher than the first quarter. Non-GAAP adjustments netted to $258 million or $0.24 per share. Key non-GAAP adjustments included the following, $80 million in accounting losses recognized on the convertible note transactions, this includes loses in the second quarter on the conversions that were initiated in the first quarter as well as losses on the conversions that were initiated in the second quarter. I have more on this in a few moments. $42 million non-cash flow-through of Elpida inventory step-up related to the acquisition. Substantially all of the inventory step-up is flow-through to cost of goods sold and we don’t anticipate non-GAAP adjustments for this in the future. Q2 adjustments also included $44 million in non-cash amortization of debt discounts and other costs. This primarily consists of the imputed interest on the convertible notes and the Elpida installment debt. In the second quarter a $33 million adjustment was made to reduce the provisional gain on acquisition of Elpida, as a result of a change in the determined fair value of Elpida’s assets and liabilities. $55 million in non-cash taxes related to the Elpida operations in the quarter, and finally 42 million share anti-dilutive effect of capped calls based on the average stock price during the second quarter of $23.06. In the third quarter, we expect the following non-GAAP adjustments. Approximately $40 million amortization of debt discounts on the convertible notes and the Elpida installment debt. We expect the results of the third quarter to also reflect $8 million of losses as the debt conversions initiated in the second quarter are completed. We estimate a $5 million to $10 million expense for the tax effects netted against these non-GAAP items. Non-cash taxes related to the Elpida acquisition of between $60 million and $70 million. Also, the anti-dilutive effect of our capped calls will be based on the average share price for the quarter. Assuming a $24 share price, this would equate to a reduction in diluted shares of 40 million. Please refer to our convertible debt dilution table, which is included in the earnings call data file posted on our Web site. Let’s turn now to our results by technology and our guidance. DRAM; DRAM revenue in the second quarter reflects stable bit sales and stable average selling prices. We experienced favorable overall market conditions and gross margins improved about five percentage points to the high 30% range. Gross margins benefitted from record sales in the service segment and increasing mix of PC and networking sales as well as the shift to lower cost and higher margin wafer sales in the mobile segment. If our share of Inotera’s income in the second quarter were recorded in our DRAM gross margin, and we add back the higher cost from the inventory step-up from the Elpida acquisition, our reported DRAM margin would be approximately six percentage points higher than reported on a GAAP basis. DRAM gross margins for Q3 using quarter-to-date ASP and projected mix for the quarter indicates approximately flat gross margin compared to Q2 based on bit production down in the low single-digits including the small reduction in wafer production as a result of the earthquake which temporarily disrupted our Hiroshima fab operations. Quarter-to-date ASP down low single-digits on mixed effects, and cost per bit down low single-digits, the key items affecting our DRAM guidance for the third quarter are; continued favorable market conditions and generally flat like-for-like product ASP trends quarter-to-date. Limited impact going forward of selling through stepped up inventory acquired with Elpida and lower cost of product coming from Inotera as a result of a greater discount percentage as prescribed in the pricing formula. Turning now to NAND, on the Trade NAND side, sales volume increased primarily as a result of the continued conversion of our same four fab operations to NAND. Trade NAND gross margins in the second quarter were in the high 20% range, down approximately 5 percentage points quarter-over-quarter. Selling prices came under pressure during the second quarter partially due to seasonality and partially due to increased sales in the channel for our incremental production. NAND bit cost reductions were achieved through higher sales volumes of advanced technology products and cost efficiencies associated with expanding production in our NAND focused Singapore operations. Trade gross margins for Q3 using quarter-to-date ASP and projected mix for the quarter indicate down a couple of points compared to Q2 based on bit production is expected to be down high single-digits, quarter-to-date ASP down low single-digits and cost per bit flat. The key trends affecting this guidance are substantially completing the conversion of the Singapore fab to NAND from DRAM as I mentioned. On a like-for-like product basis we expect to see some market price reductions for NAND in the third quarter. We expect a higher mix of Trade NAND sales in the third quarter to be in the form of SSDs, which have higher bit selling prices and higher costs. Notably SSDs also have longer manufacturing cycle times which impacts our Q3 bit production as we ramp to higher volumes. In NOR as we indicated in our Q2 guidance NOR sales continued their quarterly decrease with a market shift in wireless applications to NAND, Q3 NOR revenue is expected to be in the $100 million to $110 million range. Longer term, we expect to see revenue stability and growth in gross margins with a vast majority of NOR sales in the embedded market now and our planned transition to 300 millimeter production. Looking to the other P&L and cash flow results and guidance, the Company generated $1.4 billion in operating cash flow in the second quarter. As a reminder, the Q1 operating cash flow included a deposit from a customer of $250 million associated with a long-term DRAM supply agreement. So, on a normalized basis, we’re seeing continued improvement in operating cash flows. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of just over $5 billion, up about 650 million from the prior quarter. This amount includes just over $2 billion at Elpida and its subsidiaries, which is not available for general purposes across the rest of the Company. Expenditures for property, plant and equipment in the second quarter were 565 million, and we are on-track to be within our guided range for the fiscal year of $2.6 billion to $3.2 billion. During the year the Company was focused on reducing the potential dilution associated with our convertible notes through a series of financial transactions. As we outlined at our Analyst Day in February, we intend to migrate our debt mix towards more straight debt overtime where the straight debt has investment grade like covenants and competitive rates. In the second quarter as part of our overall capital strategy, the Company completed an inaugural high yield debt offering that satisfied these objectives, raising $600 million of straight debt with net proceeds to be used for the retirement of our 2014 convertible notes. In the second quarter we called for redemption of the 2014 notes as well. Given the settlement period required for their conversion, all of the remaining 2014 notes will be settled in the third quarter. As a result, our cash and debt balances will be reduced by approximately $700 million in the third quarter from settlement of these notes. Year-to-date, once we settle the remaining 2014 notes in the third quarter, the net financial effects of the debt restructuring transactions, including the issuance of the high yield debt, increases our debt slightly by approximately $40 million, utilizes approximately $1.3 billion of cash and reduces equity by approximately $1.1 billion. Most importantly, we will have reduced the dilution exposure related to our convertible notes by approximately 68 million shares which adds to the 40 million shares of capped call coverage we have in place assuming the $24 stock price. Now I will turn it over to Mark Adams for his comments. Mark?
Mark Adams: Thanks Ron. Overall, we were pleased with the team’s execution in Q2. In a quarter that at times has proven to be a weaker demand period due to seasonality coming out of the holiday season, our DRAM business continued to deliver strong results with stable revenue and strong gross margin expansion. Our DRAM capacity supports customers and our DRAM solutions group, wireless solutions group and embedded solutions group. We had record bit shipments in DRAM specialty markets including server, consumer and graphic segments. Our server business achieved 68% year-over-year bit growth in the second quarter. Micron continues to provide our key server customers with unique solutions to help differentiate their products. We are working on HMC or hybrid memory computing enablement with key server customers. We also achieved DDR4 validation at key chipset partners and are beginning to ramp to volume production. We continue to see strong growth in the public clouds market, indicating a three year DRAM bit demand CAGR of 76%. Our networking business continues to be a segment where our capacity yields attractive returns. Our strong position in networking applications is a result of our technology leading solutions and excellent customer relationships. HMC enablement is also ongoing with major networking customers as a path to provide a higher bandwidth performance. DDR4 enablement with our key chipset partners will drive further differentiation for network solutions. Demand drivers such as LTE roll out in China and continued cloud and datacenter growth fosters a healthy demand outlook for the back half of our year. Our graphics business had a record quarter shipping over 100 million gigabits. We saw major customer qualification of our GDDR5 product and positive yield improvement on our 25 nanometer process. We had an impressive quarter in the digital TV segment highlighted by a major win for our new I/O products with a key consumer electronics partner. In addition, we saw a better than expected sales at major game console customers. The desktop and notebook segment remained in good balance during our second quarter and pricing was up quarter-over-quarter. As we commented during our last call, we will continue to optimize our computing versus mobile capacity as driven by market dynamics with a goal of generating the best possible return. In Q2 PC DRAM shipment volume was up 11% when compared to Q1.  This upside was driven by improvement in overall cycle times as well as continued favorable demand and supply balance in the market. From what we can tell, DRAM capacity in the industry has normalized following the recovery of one of our competitor’s fabs in China. Despite this capacity recovery DRAM market conditions remain favorable and inventories in the channel remain relatively tight below normal levels. On the mobile front our WSG group had an outstanding quarter with operating margins of 20%. Like-for-like mobile DRAM prices were relatively stable quarter-over-quarter but our blended ASP was down primarily due to increased sales of mobile DRAM wafers also referred to as known good die. WSG revenue was down for the quarter as we adjusted our product mix but the business unit was significantly more profitable, inventory of mobile products in the market remains tight and demand signals from our customers are strong. Coming out of Mobile World Congress we saw a continued impressive memory growth in the low and mid range price phones segments as a number of customers announced products with 2 gigabytes of mobile DRAM a density historically found only in high-end smartphones. Our embedded solutions group recorded revenue of $365 million with continued strong operating margins of 16% which would have been higher if not impacted by I/O charges in our NOR manufacturing network. These charges should wind down over the coming quarters. ESG had a record revenue for Q2 in the automotive segment. On the product front we had greater than 40% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in AMC for the embedded market with NAND and low powered DRAM MCPs also growing in the industrial segment. We remain bullish on the market demand and confident in our product breadth as we drive our embedded business in Q3. Our Trade NAND revenue was over $1 billion in the quarter, up 11% as we continue the conversion of fab seven in Singapore from DRAM to NAND. This conversion is now essentially complete as of Q3 although we will have a small amount of legacy specialty DRAM remaining for another quarter or so. As we mentioned on our last call this DRAM to NAND conversion necessitated a requalification of NAND material for products like SSD, consumer products and eMMC solutions. These qualifications are all independent on our customer’s qualification cycles as well as timing related to product bills, and those can last a few quarters. The result is we end up with more products sold in component form compared to our long-term target for the NAND business. We are continuing to shift our overall NAND production to our industry leading 16 nanometer technology which in our early ramp is shipping into consumer markets such as memory cards, USB storage devices and embedded consumer products. These transitions in our manufacturing output will enable a lower cost product mix in the future. We are currently in the qualification process at Q1 OEMs for our 20 nanometer M550 SSD products and anticipate shipping and volume for the back half of calendar 2014. Our Crucial branded M550 client SSD shipments will begin in volume in Q3. Beyond SSDs our consumer product group had some major wins and new retail customers with Lexar branded USB and card products. Given current market pricing in the component channel, we feel these end markets will offer a better alternative than sell inventory in the NAND market. Despite some market softness in NAND, we remain optimistic on the long-term demand profile for the end market segments. Both from a unique growth and the density per unit perspective decline in enterprise SSD business continue to represent strong growth segments. NAND storage upgrades in the high-end smartphone market as well as unit and content growth in mid range smartphones fuel the overall mobile market at a large and growing consumer demand. In addition, the consumer in embedded business are migrating from low density NAND and NOR applications to higher density flash memory. We remain focused on adding value to our NAND technology by building the right organization capabilities and skill sets to deliver premium NAND solutions to our customers. To that end, we are pleased to welcome Darren Thomas as our Vice President of Micron's Storage business unit. Darren most recently served as the Vice President of storage and networking products at Dell. He brings a unique customer perspective and understanding the different ways that market will utilize flash memory in the storage systems’ architecture going forward. We continue to invest in our underlying NAND technology as well. Our 16 nanometer NAND yields have been very positive and position us well from a cost perspective. We are currently planning to ship 60 nanometer to TLC in calendar Q4 in order to better position our portfolio from a cost perspective in the retail and consumer segments. We are excited about our 3D NAND technology aimed at higher performance applications, still targeting volume production planned for fiscal 2015. While our DRAM business is performing well, we are committed to improving our long-term margin structure of this business. On the technology front, we are spending the migration of 25 nanometer and manufacturing beyond PC and mobile with a focus on server level quality with our top customers. Our 20 nanometer process migration DRAM is still on-track to commence at the end of this calendar year, all of which, which should improve our overall cost position in DRAM. Organizationally driven by our opportunity to serve a more diversified set of end markets, we’ve implemented a new structure starting in Q3 aimed at better responding to application, market segment and customer specific requirements. We will engage our customers through one or four market facing business units, computing and networking or CMBU, mobile MBU, storage SBU and embedded EBU. Tom Eby, who previous ran our embedded business is now going to lead the computing and networking business. Mike Rayfield will continue to lead our mobile business and Darren Thomas, as previously mentioned, will run the storage business. Jeff Bader, who has been the Vice President of Marketing for ESG has been promoted to run the embedded business unit. In support of these market facing organizations we have set up three engineering groups including DRAM, non-volatile memory and advanced control development to help deliver the right customer and market specific products. The combination of the four market facing business units with the NAND engineering organization will form what we now call the memory solutions group which will be led by Brian Shirley and his new position as Vice President of Memory Solutions. We are confident this new organization will help us better react to unique customer requirements in a memory business which is increasingly solutions oriented. We continue to see overall good balance in the memory industry and we are investing in opportunities to differentiate our products and with our customers. With that I will hand it back over to Kipp.
Kipp Bedard: Thanks Mark. We will now take questions from callers. Just a reminder, if you’re using a speaker phone please pick up the handset when asking a question so we can hear you clearly.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Pitzer : Yes, good afternoon guys. Congratulations for the results. I guess my first set of questions revolves around the NAND business, may be for Mark Adams. Mark, can you just help me understand a little bit better within the February quarter, you guys kind of significantly beat the bit production guidance you gave, but you sort of missed on the bit cost reduction. And I’m just kind of curious the reason behind that typically you would expect that a bit production were higher perhaps cost would have been better, if you could help me understand that better that’d be helpful?
 Credit Suisse: Yes, good afternoon guys. Congratulations for the results. I guess my first set of questions revolves around the NAND business, may be for Mark Adams. Mark, can you just help me understand a little bit better within the February quarter, you guys kind of significantly beat the bit production guidance you gave, but you sort of missed on the bit cost reduction. And I’m just kind of curious the reason behind that typically you would expect that a bit production were higher perhaps cost would have been better, if you could help me understand that better that’d be helpful?
Mark Adams: Typically as we’ve made this conversion early ramp production cost going into our product costing it was pretty close to our guide for the quarter and we overall kind of are still ramping as I mentioned earlier we’re not fully ramped the facility so we anticipate that there’ll be continued improvements but at this point it’s kind of the process of kind of ramping that facility in higher cost early stage.
John Pitzer : And then Mark a longer term question on NAND, as you think about where your margins are today versus your competitors. Can you talk about may be the two or three things that you need to do to bring your NAND margins up to kind of industry average?
 Credit Suisse: And then Mark a longer term question on NAND, as you think about where your margins are today versus your competitors. Can you talk about may be the two or three things that you need to do to bring your NAND margins up to kind of industry average?
Mark Adams: Sure I think that the things that we think about at Micron really are how we package our products and the innovation around control and firmware as it relates to not just SSD and storage but also eMMC and the mobile phone and embedded business and how we optimize those products. Secondly, we had a customer base that primarily was requiring MLC products in the past and our utilization of TLC in the future would be a big benefit to us. As I mentioned we expect to have our 16 nanometer TLC products in calendar Q4 into the channel. And also I think that there are some interesting choices we’ve made that were probably right for the time in the past, but when you look at a market like retail where now that’s really two primary players we’re seeing a pretty stable business than one that we like to continue to grow and so our market segmentation getting away from this component trade sales, if you will, to things like growing our retail, and our channel SSD business where it provides the margin and ASP uplift. Those were kind of two or three things I think are most important to us.
John Pitzer : And then guys my last quick question here on the DRAM front, you guys I think started server DRAM it’s up pretty significantly year-over-year. I’m kind of curious, the impact you guys see coming from end memory database. You saw Intel bring out a new class of Xeon chip, where really the only incremental benefit was how much DRAM it could address. You’ve heard Oracle talk about having to put more DRAM into their data appliance tools. How big is that market today, and could that drive significantly better kind of enterprise, demand for DRAM that you guys are predicting right now?

Mark Adams: Yes, absolutely. And we think that we are pretty well positioned to take advantage of that. Not just for those relationships that you’ve mentioned. But through advanced technology we’re developing at Micron. So we see it as a pretty critical part of our overall strategy and we’ll continue to keep you updated on our product development.
John Pitzer : Thanks guys, congratulations.
 Credit Suisse: Thanks guys, congratulations.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy with Stifel. Your line is open.
Kevin Cassidy : Thanks for taking my question. And along those lines for the server applications, the DDR4 announcement that you had, are you expecting to ship that for revenue in the June quarter, or in the May quarter?
 Stifel Nicolaus: Thanks for taking my question. And along those lines for the server applications, the DDR4 announcement that you had, are you expecting to ship that for revenue in the June quarter, or in the May quarter?
Mark Durcan: Yes. We are targeting to ship that in early, volume material, in the quarter to commercial applications for our customers.
Kevin Cassidy : Is that sooner than you had expected?
 Stifel Nicolaus: Is that sooner than you had expected?
Mark Durcan: No, right about what we thought.
Kevin Cassidy : Okay. And may be as you are moving from the 25 nanometer and starting with your 20 nanometer, what kind of cost reductions are you expecting from 25 nanometer to 20 nanometer?
 Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. And may be as you are moving from the 25 nanometer and starting with your 20 nanometer, what kind of cost reductions are you expecting from 25 nanometer to 20 nanometer?
Mark Durcan: Kevin, as we’ve talked about in the past, it’s pretty hard to do a year-over-year on these because these transitions are shifting out, so lengthy if you will, but generally if you take the process node changes, that’s what you would ultimately get.
Kevin Cassidy : Okay thank you.
 Stifel Nicolaus: Okay thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Joe Moore : Yes thank you. Looking to production growth in NAND down high single-digits in May, I understand your response that this is through a strong, the longer SSD lead times but I am so surprised you go from up 35% in February which is quite pretty steep kind of growth each month to down high single-digits. Can you elaborate a little bit more on what’s happening there?
 Morgan Stanley: Yes thank you. Looking to production growth in NAND down high single-digits in May, I understand your response that this is through a strong, the longer SSD lead times but I am so surprised you go from up 35% in February which is quite pretty steep kind of growth each month to down high single-digits. Can you elaborate a little bit more on what’s happening there?
Mark Durcan: Yes I mean the biggest part for us is that we looked at the markets that we’re serving, we take a look at that business and look at the opportunities to place these bits into the channel and what segments. And certainly SSDs offer us a larger cycle time as far as the product building and manufacturing and so that’s driving a lot of it. To be honest with you, that’s where we see our growth in terms of products. And I think it’s being reflected in a much higher and improved performance in SSDs in Q3.
Joe Moore : Okay great thanks and then, with the growth in the TLC that you’ve talked about kind of being more aggressive in the back half; what are the markets that where you think you will see that deployed first for you?
 Morgan Stanley: Okay great thanks and then, with the growth in the TLC that you’ve talked about kind of being more aggressive in the back half; what are the markets that where you think you will see that deployed first for you?
Mark Durcan: Well I think today if you look at those markets, really for kind of high volume low-end consumer business, I do think that you will see eventually client SSDs and TLC are in the future, a lot of companies have been talking trying to develop that. We think we have a good path to that overtime. I think early application can mostly consumer and retail.
Joe Moore : Great thank you very much.
 Morgan Stanley: Great thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest. Your line is open.
Monika Garg : Thanks for taking my question. Could you provide more details regarding your share of Inotera and the loss on the Qimonda which you just talked about in the beginning, and could that mean that you will have to transfer the whole share? If you challenge that then how long do you think it could take to resolve this?
 Pacific Crest: Thanks for taking my question. Could you provide more details regarding your share of Inotera and the loss on the Qimonda which you just talked about in the beginning, and could that mean that you will have to transfer the whole share? If you challenge that then how long do you think it could take to resolve this?
Mark Durcan: Yes Monika, since this is an ongoing case, I am not going to answer too many questions about that. But let me just reiterate. We believe the decision contains significant errors and that the proceedings were fundamentally flawed. I will give you an example, the Court heard only from trustee witnesses. No witnesses from Micron, no expert testimony. And so as I said before, we will definitely appeal. The other important thing that you should know is that the Inotera supply and technology relationship is not dependent on Micron’s ownership of these shares. And so we have other shares that we own above and beyond these shares and whether we did or we didn’t the relationship stands above and beyond the ownership.
Monika Garg : Thanks and then just the last one on the NAND side, could you maybe talk about how much percentage of output is at 16 and how much at 20? And then when do you expect that -- I mean as in and you will do some low transition starting 2015 for 3D NAND still a kind would it be first half or second half 2015?
 Pacific Crest: Thanks and then just the last one on the NAND side, could you maybe talk about how much percentage of output is at 16 and how much at 20? And then when do you expect that -- I mean as in and you will do some low transition starting 2015 for 3D NAND still a kind would it be first half or second half 2015?
Mark Durcan: Well, I’ve mentioned as 3D NAND was a 2015 shipment, within 2014 we’re roughly in this profile market we’re roughly about today during Q2 32% 25 nanometer, 60% 20 nanometer, and some of that SLC. In Q3, we intend to keep moving slightly towards a 20 nanometer mix.
Monika Garg : Okay thank you.
 Pacific Crest: Okay thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee. Your line is open.
Vijay Rakesh : Hi, guys congratulation on another solid and descent quarter here. I just had a couple of questions on the DRAM side obviously pricing very stable with dollar concerns but and the bit growth it’s a little light, can you elaborate is that because of tech transitions or capacity?
 Sterne Agee: Hi, guys congratulation on another solid and descent quarter here. I just had a couple of questions on the DRAM side obviously pricing very stable with dollar concerns but and the bit growth it’s a little light, can you elaborate is that because of tech transitions or capacity?
Mark Durcan: The DRAM bit growth for us was kind of more because we had the conversion going on in Singapore, which when you have rated some of the other proven areas in process bit growth kind of gave us what we have to the quarter. So it’s really a combination of the guidance we gave is pretty accurate relative to Q2 and it’s really related on moving parts Singapore reducing and some of the process improvement elsewhere.
Mark Adams: And the situation I might just add with I’ve mentioned the Hiroshima fab and we had a minor earthquake event and had a little bit short-term effort on it.
Vijay Rakesh : Got it. Thanks. On the NAND side what percent was SSD in the February quarter and you have mentioned you’re increasing SSD output and what do you think the mix would be in SSD and NAND that’s throughout May-August?
 Sterne Agee: Got it. Thanks. On the NAND side what percent was SSD in the February quarter and you have mentioned you’re increasing SSD output and what do you think the mix would be in SSD and NAND that’s throughout May-August?
Mark Durcan: On our last call I had mentioned that the conversion process of the fab as a percentage of overall output would have a decreasing effect in Q2 and so it was in the single-digits in terms of our overall capacity SSD for NAND. We expect that to be much improved in Q3 relative to going up significantly in Q3 with both commercial OEM relationships as well as a channel. Somewhere almost approaching half of our NAND and NAND output getting back to us.
Vijay Rakesh : Alright, great thanks.
 Sterne Agee: Alright, great thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. The first question I have is on the DRAM. Can you elaborate on the margin profile different between mobile and commodity?
 SIG: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. The first question I have is on the DRAM. Can you elaborate on the margin profile different between mobile and commodity?
Mark Durcan: Yes, both are pretty good.
Mehdi Hosseini : Can you elaborate on that? What is the difference? Are they both the same level? Are you able to get the kind of margin that the mobile requires giving the die-size difference?
 SIG: Can you elaborate on that? What is the difference? Are they both the same level? Are you able to get the kind of margin that the mobile requires giving the die-size difference?
Mark Durcan: Yes, a good way to look at it. As you can go back and when we gave you Elpida specific data in Q1 and in August, that’s a pretty representation of where and how good the mobile business can be and answer to your question PC is running just slightly behind that on the gross margin basis.
Mehdi Hosseini : Okay, thank you. And then on the NAND side, can also elaborate on the mix of embedded NADN as overall NAND or as overall revenues?
 SIG: Okay, thank you. And then on the NAND side, can also elaborate on the mix of embedded NADN as overall NAND or as overall revenues?
Mark Durcan: Well embedded business as you can see kind of get a sense on the embedded business relative it’s about proportional to what embedded business is to our top-line revenue. And then the NAND business kind of narrows that with embedded. And we’re seeing emerging for that to growth in future but right now it’s a nice proportion to our revenue.
Mehdi Hosseini : Okay and then the one final question. It seems to me that the CapEx is pretty much back and loaded, is that correct Ron?
 SIG: Okay and then the one final question. It seems to me that the CapEx is pretty much back and loaded, is that correct Ron?
Ron Foster: A little bit, yes. As I mentioned we’re still projected to be within our guidance range of 2.6 to 3.2. We ran about 560 million this quarter.
Mehdi Hosseini : But should we assume that you’re going to hit the midpoint or more towards the low end given what…
 SIG: But should we assume that you’re going to hit the midpoint or more towards the low end given what…
Ron Foster: I’m not elaborating on the range yet that’s the range we’re giving you 2.6 to 3.2. I don’t have refinement on that at this point.
Mehdi Hosseini : Okay thank so much.
 SIG: Okay thank so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Gauna with JMP Securities. Your line is open.
Alex Gauna : Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on the result. I was wondering if you could go beyond your guidance for you high single digits, down high single digit production estimates on NAND. I know that’s a production estimate within considering fail would you expect there to be a greater decline than what you’re producing a less because of MLC to TLC or mix factors? Thank you.
 JMP Securities: Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on the result. I was wondering if you could go beyond your guidance for you high single digits, down high single digit production estimates on NAND. I know that’s a production estimate within considering fail would you expect there to be a greater decline than what you’re producing a less because of MLC to TLC or mix factors? Thank you.
Mark Durcan: Alex just let me make sure that room understands your question. Are you asking for a little more detail on what we think the relationship between the sales bits versus the production guide can be?
Alex Gauna : Correct, thank you.
 JMP Securities: Correct, thank you.
Mark Adams: So, Alex it’s Mark Adams, basically consistent with messages both at our Analyst Day and on prior calls we’re going to look at this kind of from a what’s the best return on our capacity and the decisions we’re making around inventories. We look at the market conditions right now and we see some targets for stronger margins, and stronger ASPs and that’s what we’re trying to drive our product portfolio to do, within a given quarter we can have an impact on how much we sell and how much we direct of these different products opportunities, i.e. if we could ship the components into the consumer channel or to the spot market or if we ship them in SSDs and so we go through and look at the market conditions that’s really what drives our choices so it’s really nice if you’re going to correlate what that’s going to look like. Having said that, we look at the demand for those entire segments as very strong and even in Q3 we think that the actual systems level products find us a stage enterprise and some of consumer markets going to have a very strong quarter.
Alex Gauna : Okay, and is that somewhat should we think about that mixed benefit being something of a delta to add to the difference between what you’re expecting from ASP declines and what you’re expecting from cost declines. Should we not think of that as a one to one correlation because of those mixed factors you’re talking about?
 JMP Securities: Okay, and is that somewhat should we think about that mixed benefit being something of a delta to add to the difference between what you’re expecting from ASP declines and what you’re expecting from cost declines. Should we not think of that as a one to one correlation because of those mixed factors you’re talking about?
Ron Foster: Alex, this is Ron, I think the reason I gave you a view on sort of the trend of gross margin is we’re trying to give you an overall perspective on the business, we have a lot of things to move around quarter-to-quarter between products and customer mix and it affects cost and ASP ranges but in general it will be down a couple of points on margin, and quarter-to-quarter, a NAND and that’s probably the most complete way to give it to you. We have variability I mentioned in terms of SSD flow, we’re actually ramping SSDs in the quarter and it’s hard to call how much of that will move out in the quarter in your production versus sales question and how much flows into the next quarter but we’re ramping and that’s the important news.
Alex Gauna : Okay and real quick, DDR4 you said you will be shipping in May, what end markets are going to be taking that both in May and then maybe in the second half as well?
 JMP Securities: Okay and real quick, DDR4 you said you will be shipping in May, what end markets are going to be taking that both in May and then maybe in the second half as well?
Ron Foster: Mostly networking and server customers.
Alex Gauna : Okay, very good, thanks so much, congratulations.
 JMP Securities: Okay, very good, thanks so much, congratulations.
Ron Foster: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Mark Delaney :  Thanks very much for taking the question. On the last call I know your team had talked to about not wanting to optimize margins in the short-term at the expenses from your long-term margins when you’re after that, thinking about your overall capacity between DRAM and NAND. I think you guys have talked at that point about expecting NAND margin to catch back up to DRAM, we’re discussing this. Now that the NAND margins per your guidance are a bit below where your DRAM margins are for next quarter, has the calculations changed at all in terms of thinking about the mix of your capacity between DRAM and NAND?
 Goldman Sachs:  Thanks very much for taking the question.

Now that the NAND margins per your guidance are a bit below where your DRAM margins are for next quarter, has the calculations changed at all in terms of thinking about the mix of your capacity between DRAM and NAND?
Mark Durcan: We don’t want to try and react with too high a frequency to changes in the marketplace. When we make those kind of comments we’re really talking about long-term decisions as opposed to short-term opportunities. Having said that, we’re always maintaining flexibility in our business, particularly relative to segments and with a lower frequency relative to technologies.
Ron Foster: Guess the only thing I’d add from a efficiency standpoint, we now have all of our Singapore operations essentially running on NAND and that gives us a real benefits in terms of operational efficiency and cost going forward, and that’s also the strategic decision.
Mark Delaney : Okay, that’s helpful and I think you guys have talked about having some 3D NAND samples out this year, can you give us an update on how that’s progressing?
 Goldman Sachs: Okay, that’s helpful and I think you guys have talked about having some 3D NAND samples out this year, can you give us an update on how that’s progressing?
Mark Durcan: Yes, we have very good progress I think on our 3D NAND technology. We’re very excited we’ve got the functional components with very strong device characteristics and talking about things like Window budgets and the tightness of our programming levels etc, so we’re very, very excited about it. We decided that we’re not going to sample for now, we like our relative competitive position and where we are relative to what we hear others might be. And so we’re going till we’re a little closer to volume production before, we unnecessarily expose ourselves by getting samples out there in the market place.
Mark Delaney : Thank you very much and good luck.
 Goldman Sachs: Thank you very much and good luck.
Mark Durcan: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Galvin with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Thomas Galvin :  Thanks. On that subject of 3D NAND what’s the motivation for not sampling at the moment, you still don’t want to show your open the common if you will for the competition?
 Raymond James:  Thanks. On that subject of 3D NAND what’s the motivation for not sampling at the moment, you still don’t want to show your open the common if you will for the competition?
Mark Durcan: Well our focus is going to be to deliver system level 3D NAND products and putting a bunch of non-enabled components out in the market place right now for our competitors to see is of limited value. I think we want to wait till a little bit closer to where we those system level solutions enabled and then of course we’ll be working closely with our most valued customers to make sure they understand what’s coming down the pipe and the value we can deliver for and with it.
Thomas Galvin : And can you share with us how many layers you have on your 3D NAND approach?
 Raymond James: And can you share with us how many layers you have on your 3D NAND approach?
Mark Durcan: No, that’s the kind of thing we’re not wanting to share right now.
Thomas Galvin : Okay and just one last one on 3D, if you could provide industry dynamic in terms of the overall ramp of 3D NAND. Is it as expected, slower than expected, that would be helpful? Thanks.
 Raymond James: Okay and just one last one on 3D, if you could provide industry dynamic in terms of the overall ramp of 3D NAND. Is it as expected, slower than expected, that would be helpful? Thanks.
Mark Durcan: I think it’s about as we’ve been indicating for Micron it’s maybe slower than some of the early noise was. We still anticipate will be in the marketplace late this year, but the impact of the marketplace is not really until second half ’15 and maybe with some folks I thinks further talk a little late in that even now.
Thomas Galvin : Okay thank you.
 Raymond James: Okay thank you.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Pitzer : Hey guys sorry if I missed it. I just wondering on the OpEx guide for the May quarter, can you help me understand the increase on the down revenue quarter, is this just that you’re pulling in some project or how do I think about the OpEx level?
 Credit Suisse: Hey guys sorry if I missed it. I just wondering on the OpEx guide for the May quarter, can you help me understand the increase on the down revenue quarter, is this just that you’re pulling in some project or how do I think about the OpEx level?
Ron Foster: Well, John this is Ron. The OpEx guide is generally in line with our run rate for the quarter, this most recent quarter maybe up a little bit higher and that’s usually a function of wafer calls on the R&D side. We were 344 in Q2 and regarding 345 to 355 that just typically wafer call cost and that sort of thing that’s cycled differently each quarter. And then SG&A we’re right in there with 177 was this quarter and we’re guiding 170 to 180.
John Pitzer : And then Mark I think you’ve said in the calendar fourth quarter that you would expect to be shipping TLC, is that intend to enterprise SSD as well can you talk a little bit about controller technology around TLC?
 Credit Suisse: And then Mark I think you’ve said in the calendar fourth quarter that you would expect to be shipping TLC, is that intend to enterprise SSD as well can you talk a little bit about controller technology around TLC?
Mark Durcan: John, my point earlier was that initial applications for our 60 nanometer TLC components will be more consumer and retail oriented upfront. To-date no one has had a lot of success even on the client side enabling TLC memory. There is a lot of work being done and your question around controller development is a good one because I think that’s where the error correction and capabilities around enabling TLC to be reliable enough to ship in that segment. But we still think that’s kind of a 2015 calendar year phenomenon, we don’t see that happening in large scale in calendar ’14.
John Pitzer : Thank you.
 Credit Suisse: Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with RBC. Your line is open.
Doug Freedman : Thanks for taking my question guys and congratulation on a strong quarter. Can you give me a sense of what your inventory plan might be for next quarter?
 RBC Capital Markets: Thanks for taking my question guys and congratulation on a strong quarter. Can you give me a sense of what your inventory plan might be for next quarter?
Mark Durcan: Sure, this quarter as you can see our inventory was flat and as we look at inventory we’ve kind of communicated this message and one good chance do it again, we’re looking at this business from returns perspective and not looking to hit some arbitrary inventory numbers in a given quarter. Even the DRAM business it’s pretty tight right now, so.
Ron Foster: Really tight.
Mark Durcan: Really tight, so we don’t feel like we’re in a position that we’re going to be holding back inventory. We’ve got customers who need us to support them and it’s pretty healthy market. The NAND business as we’ve talked about earlier we’re going to make choices around the customer relationships and the product opportunities, but we’re going to resist the temptation to hit again a predefined number and inventory. We’re going to run the business to make money and we’re going to run it through the right products and that’s kind of an ongoing process we’re going to do.
Doug Freedman : When I look forward, if you could, so far you guys have been pretty good in the last couple of quarters about hitting the numbers, have you reconsidered whether or how close are we to getting actual guidance going forward?
 RBC Capital Markets: When I look forward, if you could, so far you guys have been pretty good in the last couple of quarters about hitting the numbers, have you reconsidered whether or how close are we to getting actual guidance going forward?
Mark Durcan: Yes Doug it’s a good question and we’ve talked in the past this is something we are constantly reviewing and I think we believe that’s going to be appropriate at some point. We’re not ready to do it just yet.
Doug Freedman : And I guess my last question; it does appear and you’ve talked about your qualifications that are necessary in NAND, I’m seeing some signs that there is definitely different qualities of NAND out in the market, can you maybe talk about whether there is any concern on your part that the quality of your product there in the market might not be reflective of the quality that you can deliver in the future? And does that run the risk of having any potential of damaging your brand?
 RBC Capital Markets: And I guess my last question; it does appear and you’ve talked about your qualifications that are necessary in NAND, I’m seeing some signs that there is definitely different qualities of NAND out in the market, can you maybe talk about whether there is any concern on your part that the quality of your product there in the market might not be reflective of the quality that you can deliver in the future? And does that run the risk of having any potential of damaging your brand?
Mark Durcan: Well, we kind of feel pretty strong about what we’ve delivered. This is being a new category. Customers over the last couple of years have been working with something like Micron to make this world-class quality level technology they can bring to both desktop and to the enterprise. Having said that, we’ve invested a lot in quality especially in the SSD place and our NAND performance had been actually coming from key enterprise customers as the higher performing NAND in the market. So as we look at our business, we learn a lot the new category but we feel pretty strong about our technology and our products. The areas we’ve invested the most for example PCIe, we’ve had the highest performance products in the market. So from a reliability standpoint, we don’t see that as a something that we’re explaining anything about the past. We think it’s been a pretty good quality opportunity for us to grow and to learn about system level solutions. And we think, we need a strong product development in the future.
Doug Freedman : Great. If I could sneak one last one on the DRAM front. In last quarter you talked quite a bit about shipping in wafer format, I believe the demand for wafer format is dropping a little bit. How do we think about the trade off of maybe bit growth for those wafers versus margin? How much of delta is there in wafer sales versus component sales and what type of impact does that have on the bit growth numbers?

How do we think about the trade off of maybe bit growth for those wafers versus margin? How much of delta is there in wafer sales versus component sales and what type of impact does that have on the bit growth numbers?
Ron Foster: The margin on the known good die that Mark mentioned is better which is why we took advantages of it over the last couple of quarters. We’re going to ship . I think you’re right in characterizing that. We’ll probably ship fewer of those types of wafers which all of that wrapped in by the ways because I’m getting some questions on some of the guidance we had adds to this mix effect on in terms of bit growth and cost downs. But I think you’ve characterized it right that the known good die program is more profitable for us than packaged parts. And we have had a pretty strong market for about six months to ship more and more wafers into that. And I think now we’re going to probably back off that just little bit. But as Mark and Mark both alluded to, we’re actually shifting mix into customers that are drastically needed and be in short shift today. So there is plenty of homes for where we mix DRAM will continue to maximize margin with us.
Doug Freedman : Great. Thanks for taking all my questions.
 RBC Capital Markets: Great. Thanks for taking all my questions.
Mark Durcan: Good Doug. And I think we have time for one more.
Operator: Our next question is from Betsy Van Hees with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.
Betsy Van Hees : Congratulation on the quarter and thanks so much for squeezing me in. You guys talked about how tight the DRAM supply is and as you guys are looking forward and your competitor continues to bring production online and supply and demand coming more in balance, how are you guys looking at gigabyte content in PCs, are we going to see an increase in that given that things have been so tight and they have been having a hard time getting components?
 Wedbush Securities: Congratulation on the quarter and thanks so much for squeezing me in. You guys talked about how tight the DRAM supply is and as you guys are looking forward and your competitor continues to bring production online and supply and demand coming more in balance, how are you guys looking at gigabyte content in PCs, are we going to see an increase in that given that things have been so tight and they have been having a hard time getting components?
Mark Durcan: Yes, Betsy for the first time we’re seeing the third-party data that suggest about a 12% to 15% increase in content this year. So the numbers would look something like last year’s average of about 4.3 gigabytes going to about 4.9 this year.
Betsy Van Hees : Okay great and thanks for taking my questions and congratulations getting on the quarter.
 Wedbush Securities: Okay great and thanks for taking my questions and congratulations getting on the quarter.
Mark Durcan: Thank you.

Mark Durcan: Thanks, Kipp. I would like to start today with an overview of the key developments during the quarter, followed by a few strategic and industry thoughts. I will then turn it over to Ron for financial summary. Before turning to Q&A, we will close our prepared comments with Mark Adams covering additional details of our operational performance and market conditions. Fiscal Q1 was our first full quarter with combined Micron and Elpida financials. Elpida's financial performance met or exceeded the high end of the range for the key estimates we provided in early August. The early execution of our combined teams has been impressive and in conjunction with favorable market trends, our financial results were outstanding. We achieved record quarterly revenue of over $4 billion, improved our gross margin to over 7 percentage points, and delivered very strong earnings performance. Operating cash flow was $1.5 billion and CapEx was $669 million, resulting in free cash flow of $838 million. We are focused on a capital allocation strategy to maximize long-term shareholder returns. With this in mind, we recently entered into a series of transactions to restructure our existing convertible debt and address the dilutions stemming from those converts which Ron will describe in more detail later. We will continue to focus on optimizing our capital structure. Although we had a head start on planning and technology development, we are still in the relatively early stages of the Elpida integration activities which are going very smoothly. In particular, we are very pleased with the 25-nanometer ramp execution of both Hiroshima and Rexchip fabs, this positions us at the leading edge in terms of industry technology. Our outlook for memory industry conditions remains very favorable. In terms of DRAM, the fire at Hynix Wuxi fab last fall coupled with what was a healthy supply demand situation beforehand is resulting in significant reductions in inventory across the DRAM supply chain, in particular for the PC and mobile segments. Our belief is that this tight and further declining inventory situation coupled with balanced long-term production and demand to continue to drive healthy market conditions. We will continue to monitor the market and make the best supply allocation decisions for our long-term margin profile. We expect to see the DRAM industry wafer production down about 5% in 2014 with total DRAM industry bit supply up in the mid-20% range. Micron's total DRAM bit production, including Elpida, will be well below the industry for the calendar year at about the mid-teens year-over-year given our DRAM to NAND conversion activity. Beyond 2014, we expect industry capacity to remain relatively stable. For Micron, any potential decision to add capacity in DRAM is not just about current profitability levels which while good are still below the long-term average that we believe justify the significant investments in R&D and process technology required in the business. In addition to attractive long-term returns on the existing asset base, we would need to see a fundamental and significant upward shift in bit demand consistently above approximately 40% compared to the current CAGR in the low 30% range before it would make sense for us to bring on additional wafer output. As such, in the current environment, we believe the best strategy for Micron is to continue optimizing existing capacity for improved gross margins. For NAND, we are projecting industry supply growth in the low 40% range for calendar 2014. This includes a 10% increase in industry wafer production with the remaining supply growth coming from technology. Micron's total NAND supply growth was below the industry in 2013 but it will be slightly above the industry in 2014, given our DRAM to NAND conversion. This supply forecast compares to the five-year NAND bit demand CAGR in the low-to-mid 40% range implying favorable long-term supply and demand balance. Our emphasis in NAND is on continuing to improve customer enablement and product placement and value-added applications. We are very pleased with the results for the quarter and the outlook for a healthy memory industry dynamics. We remain focused on optimizing value for our shareholders and worldwide customers in 2014 and beyond, and I will stop here and turn it over to Ron and Mark before turning it for Q&A. Ron?
Ron Foster: Thanks, Mark. Our first quarter of fiscal 2014 ended on November 28. To ensure you have easier access to the materials we are covering today, we’ve posted to our website a file containing these financial informations I will cover, including GAAP and non-GAAP results, certain key metrics for the first quarter, as well as guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2014. For the first quarter, we reported net income of $358 million or $0.30 per diluted share on record net sales of $4,042 million. These results include the unanticipated costs of the Rambus settlement and debt restructuring. As a reminder, the results for the previous quarter included the $1.5 billion non-operating gain recognized as part of the purchase accounting for the Elpida acquisition. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the quarter was $881 million or $0.77 per share. Non-GAAP adjustments totaled $523 million or $0.47 per share. Key adjustments included the following; a $233 million charge recognized on the Rambus settlement which was expensed entirely in the first quarter, $111 million non-cash flow through of Elpida inventory step up related to the acquisition, $92 million in accounting losses recognized on the convertible note transactions, a portion of which resulted from mark-to-market accounting and our improved share price in the last month of the quarter. Approximately $17 million of this amount was recorded as interest expense for the make whole premiums on the notes. Q1 adjustments also included $50 million in non-cash amortization of debt discounts and other costs. This primarily consists of the imputed interest on the convertible notes and Elpida installment debt, $73 million in non-cash taxes related to the Elpida operations in the quarter, and finally $54 million share anti-dilutive effect of capped calls based on the average stock price during the first quarter of $17.48. In the second quarter, we expect the following non-GAAP adjustments. Around $30 million flow through of Elpida inventory step up reported as a higher cost of goods sold in Q2. This should be immaterial in future periods, approximately $50 million amortization of debt discounts on the convertible notes and the Elpida installment debt. We expect the results of the second quarter to also reflect $70 million of losses when we complete the repayment of the 2027 and 2031A convertible notes. We estimate $15 million to $20 million for the tax effects netted against these items. Non-cash taxes related to the Elpida acquisition of between $65 million and $75 million. Also, the anti-dilutive effect of our capped calls will be based on the average share price for the quarter. Assuming a $22 share price, this would equate to a reduction in diluted shares of $43 million. Please refer to our convertible debt dilution table, which is included in the earnings call data file posted on our website. In fiscal Q1, DRAM revenue was up 69% and gross margins were in the low-to-mid 30% range, an improvement of over 7 percentage points from the prior quarter. This was primarily a result of two factors. First, a full quarter of the favorable cost structure of Elpida's operations. Second, opportunistic shifts to a higher mix of wafer sales in both, PC and mobile markets, which generated above average gross margins despite having below average ASPs. Like-for-like PC DRAM ASPs were up double digits in the quarter. As you know, we participate in Inotera's results with our 35% ownership interest. If you combine our share of Inotera's net income with our reported DRAM gross margins, and add back the inventory step up cost from the Elpida acquisition, DRAM margins would be approximately 7 percentage points higher than reported on a GAAP basis. I’d also note that the Inotera JV is a highly efficient capital structure, including the margin on the sale of Inotera's products and our share of their equity method earnings over the past two quarters. Inotera is currently generating an annualized ROI close to 130% based on our total cash investment to-date. As Mark mentioned, Elpida met and generally exceeded the performance estimates we provided in early August. In December, Elpida transitioned to a cost plus model similar to our other fabs across the world. As a result, Elpida is now part of our total DRAM results and will no longer have separate reportable financials. DRAM guidance for Q2 is as follows. Production bit growth is approximately flat. Quarter-to-date ASP is approximately flat, and cost per bit is down mid-teens. The key items affecting our DRAM guidance for the second quarter are; less impact going forward of selling through stepped up inventory acquired with Elpida, continued transition of the Fab 7 in Singapore to NAND production, and opportunistically shifting to a higher mix of wafer-based sales in both the PC and mobile markets with higher than average margin and below average ASP and cost. Turning now to NAND. On the Trade NAND side, revenue was up approximately 10% as we benefited from increased NAND volumes from Fab 7 in Singapore. Gross margins were in the low-to-mid 30% range, up slightly quarter-over-quarter. Like-for-like market prices were generally flat to slightly down in the quarter, although initial output from Fab 7 is selling in component form at below average margins. Trade NAND guidance for Q2 is as follows. Production bit growth of high teens. Quarter to-date ASP down high teens, and cost per bit down mid-teens. The key trends affecting Q2 guidance are; first the continued conversion of Fab 7 to NAND, which achieved wafer output crossover in the first quarter. Also, considered are lower expected ASPs related to seasonal demand and increased production of high density products initially being sold in component form, which typically have a lower average ASP. Following fiscal Q2, we expect to see an increased mix of embedded systems sales, including SSDs, which should improve our ASP mix. NOR sales in the first quarter decreased compared to the previous quarter as we continue to see NOR applications primarily in the wireless space convert to NAND. We see this trend continuing through Q2 with NOR revenue in the $100 million to $110 million range. Longer-term we expect to see revenue stability and growth in gross margins with the vast majority of NOR sales in the embedded market and our planned transition to 300 millimeter production for our new applications. The company generated $1.5 billion in operating cash flow in the first quarter. This operating cash flow includes a deposit from a customer of $250 million associated with a long-term DRAM supply agreement. This supply agreement provides for current market pricing at the time products are sold. Subtracting the $669 million capital spending from the $1.5 billion operating cash flow netted $838 million of free cash flow in the first quarter, as Mark mentioned. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $4.4 billion, up just over $200 million from our year-end. Also, in the first quarter the first installment payment of $534 million was made under Elpida's reorganization plan. The next payment is due in December of 2014. Capital spending for 2014 fiscal year is still expected to be between $2.6 billion and $3.2 billion. Earlier in the second quarter, we executed a borrowing guaranteed by the Export-Import Bank of the United States. That netted approximately $435 million with a cash interest rate of 1.26% and no significant financial covenants. We are continuing our efforts to optimize our capital structure with a focus on dilution management as well as a long-term debt reduction. The convertible note transactions I mentioned earlier were executed in response to the significant increase in our share price over the past six months or so, which has driven additional potential share dilution. The transactions reduced current potential dilution by about 3% to 4%, based on a $22 share price and reduced future potential dilution as well. The net effect of all our debt activities across the quarter was a decrease in debt of $243 million. We will continue to evaluate additional capital transactions in line with our strategic objectives. Now I will turn it over to Mark Adams for his comments.
Mark Adams: Thanks, Ron. As this is our first quarter with the Elpida operations fully integrated into our results, I thought it might be helpful to discuss how we are structured within our manufacturing network before commenting on our Q1 performance and the current state of the memory market. We have communicated on past calls that over the last 18 months or so through M&A and redefining strategic joint venture partnerships, we have increased our overall capacity by greater than 90%, all of which was existing industry capacity. A key focus for us as part of this growth is to ensure operational efficiency and how we manage that capacity. After the sale of our Italy and Israeli fabs in our fiscal year '13 and with the close of our Elpida acquisition, Micron's volume manufacturing sites are based in three geographic areas, Japan, which is primarily focused on mobile and graphics DRAM, Taiwan, the location of Inotera and Rexchip operations which is focused on computing, server and networking DRAM and Singapore which is our primary location for our high volume, non-volatile technology with NOR and NAND manufactured there. Combined with our high-volume production sites, we are manufacturing some of our specialty embedded products at our Manassas, Virginia facility and leverage our Lehi, Utah plant for our strategic NAND and emerging non-volatile production. Our customers appreciate the geographic diversity as it creates a natural hedge against production disruption and they also value the flexibility from a product sourcing perspective. On the manufacturing front, our team has done a great job in improving productivity across our network. We saw some noteworthy cycle time reduction at the sites in Q1 that lead to strong bit growth production far exceeding our guidance. As our business increasingly diversifies across a growing number of end-market segments, we continue to serve customers with different requirements. Customers and segments such as automotive, networking, gaming, mobile and storage, all plays different levels of prioritization in areas like assembly, test, supply and quality. This diversification in end market is driving us to think about each of these businesses almost as independent operations. A good example of this dynamic is how we view our inventory. In our Server business, we have customers who compete for large volume orders and thus rely on Micron's flexibility reacting to the increasingly volatile demand requirements. In NAND Flash, we serve consumer, automotive, mobile and storage customers, where a growing number of NAND chips are integrated in new packages and full system solutions. Each of these has their own build cycle and inventory requirements. Thus as our business evolves, we may strategically choose to build inventory and/or adjust our product mix accordingly. As Mark commented earlier, we were pleased with our Q1 results highlighted by a strong quarter in DRAM. Our DRAM gross margins improved over seven percentage points from Q4. Three of our four BUs consume DRAM capacity to address their customer segments, DSG, WSG and ESG. DSG, which focuses on computing, networking, server and consumer including graphics, makes up over 60% of our overall DRAM revenue. The combination of Micron's legacy mobile business and the former Elpida's mobile business comprised roughly 30% of our DRAM revenue with ESG contributing the remaining segment serving automotive, industrial, military and medical customers often referred to as a my AIMM. In my opening comments, I noted where specific products are manufactured in volume. As part of our network design, we are set up to ensure maximum flexibility in our network. For example in DRAM, we continue to evaluate our computing versus mobile demand profile to optimize profitability when possible. Even within this segment, we are managing our inventory direct output to the most profitable opportunity. A good example of this has been our mobile DRAM business. We have customers requiring known good die mobile DRAM components that are sold in wafer form as Ron noted with the margin profile more attractive compared to fully assembled models, therefore we are shifting some of our DRAM capacity in this direction to capture the incremental margin. A number of our largest OEM customers communicated shortages in DRAM, and are looking for more supply in our calendar Q1. We continue to see strong demand signals from our computing, mobile, networking and embedded customers and thus expect a healthy DRAM business throughout the remainder of our second quarter. On the DRAM technology front, we are ramping our world-class 25 nanometer process and we have been pleased with the progress to-date. We will continue to ramp 25 nanometer and will introduce our 20 nanometer technology in the second half of the calendar year. We are also the first supplier to sample low-power DDR4 to our customers and chipset partners. This allows them to debug their next-generation systems and reference platforms with Micron solutions. Our overall NAND business surpassed the $1 billion mark for the first time an 8% quarter-on-quarter increase. Our Trade NAND business achieved revenue growth of roughly 10% quarter-on-quarter with margins up slightly as bit growth was up 17%, driven primarily from our Fab 7 conversion from DRAM to NAND. As is the case, any time new capacity comes online, we are in the process of qualifying customers on products that use Fab 7 output. We thus saw an unusually high percentage of our output sold in component form versus prior quarters. We anticipate that this dynamic should last three to six more months as we align our Fab 7 output to customer qualification cycles. During the quarter, SSDs including component sales to strategic SSD customers represented 48% of our Trade NAND revenue with consumer sales coming in at 30%. We shipped our first 20 nanometer enterprise drive, the M500 DC product to a large OEM in Q1. In addition, we are on track for customer qualifications of 20 nanometer client drive at major OEMs and channel customers in fiscal Q2, and have plan to begin production of 60 nanometer client drive in our fiscal third quarter. Outside of solid state storage, we are seeing increasing NAND penetration in the mobile where when packaged behind an MMC controller, it will offer attractive demand growth. In the embedded business, we are seeing growth for NAND, some of which is the NOR replacement option and some of which comes from the development of what I would refer to as industrial solid state applications such as the automotive. Revenue in the mobile segment represented 12% of our Trade NAND, while AIM was in aggregate, 10%. On the technology front, we are on track to ramp our 16 nanometer planar NAND this calendar year and we continue to make good progress on 3-D NAND which is on track for production samples in late calendar Q1, early Q2. As we have commented on during prior calls, the NOR business is maturing and we are focused on rightsizing our operations to align with the demand profile. As a result of NOR industry dynamics, we view the NOR operations as a cash flow generation business focused on healthy returns. To that end, our embedded business is driving the majority of our capacity utilization. The shift to a more embedded mix drove margins up from single digits to about the mid-teens in Q1 despite an ongoing I/O fab charges associated with the business. We began moving NOR production to our 300 millimeter fab in Virginia which will provide significant cost reductions going forward when coupled with our leading 45 nanometer technology. We are focused on continuing to widening our cost advantage in NOR and growing our share in the embedded segment. In closing, we feel positive about the results our team achieved in Q1 both in topline revenue growth in operating margins as well as our strong cash flow generation. We continue to make progress on the integration front of the Elpida operations. The industry fundamentals remain solid as we are getting strong demand signals from a majority of our end-segments and industry supply in both DRAM and NAND look in balance. We remain optimistic for a strong Q2 and feel consolidated memory industry will continue to enable favorable market conditions over the long run. With that, I will turn it back over to Kipp.
Kipp Bedard: Thanks, Mark. Before we take questions from callers, I would like to turn the call back over to Ron for just one quick clarification.
Ron Foster: Thanks, Kipp. I had one correction I want to make sure we got out there before questions and that is in the DRAM Q2 guidance, as you can see from the schedule we filed on the website, our cost per bit is projected in the second quarter to be down high-single digits, DRAM cost per bit.
Kipp Bedard: Thanks, Ron, and happy to follow up on that with any questions as well, but with that we would like to take questions from callers. Just a reminder, if you are using a speaker phone, please pick up the handset when asking a question so we can hear you clearly.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Glen Yeung from Citigroup. Your line is open. Please go ahead, sir. Mr. Glen Yeung, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup: Sorry about that. Can you hear me? My question is on the DRAM business. I am just trying to understand the shift to more wafer-based sales. I assume, one that the more you do obviously is going to have a negative impact on revenues. So if you could just clarify that revenues might be down in the quarter if you move more towards wafer-based sales. Then the ultimate question is, is it accretive to earnings, because as you mentioned gross margins are higher in that business?
Ron Foster: Yes, I mean that's right on. The actual impact on ASPs is not necessarily favorable but overall impact on margin is favorable.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup: I am sorry. Just to clarify it, and ultimately you believe it's accretive to earnings, and combination of that will be better earnings?
Ron Foster: That’s primarily, when you think about that, that's the decision on capacity we are trying to make.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup: Okay, thanks a lot.
Mark Adams: The key Glen is both the ASP is down and costs are down, and the spread between the two is better than our average, hence a higher gross margin.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup: There you go. Okay, thanks. Second question is, your thoughts around the Wuxi fab, not in the sense of asking you when you think it will come up, but whenever it does, do you anticipate having to make any changes in the way you are looking at production, based on the idea that, that eventually comes back into full production?
Mark Adams: We don't see any of that today, Glen. We certainly anticipate that that fab is eventually going to come back into full production. We see it happening maybe in a more measured way than some have prognosticated, but certainly with tight industry inventory today and some of the changes we are already making from DRAM towards NAND, we are not expecting any significant shock to the market or the system.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup: Thanks, and last one for me just on CapEx. You are on a run rate now which will put you at the low-end of your annual CapEx guidance. Is it your anticipation that CapEx on a quarterly basis will increase?
Mark Adams: Yes. Our guidance for the year is still intact. As I mentioned, the same range $2.6 billion to $3.2 billion, so there will be quarterly differences.
Mark Durcan: I think there's one clarification on CapEx just in general. As we move into more systems and solutions, some of that CapEx is going to things that don't influence capacity necessarily. Some of it goes into things around packaging technology and assembly technology that's allowing us to build these systems and solution.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from James Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead, sir.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering now that Elpida is finally integrated, you could maybe give us a refresher on the amount of DRAM bits allocated to each of the PC, mobile, server, and other specialty areas if you would?
Mark Adams: Yes. We can do that. Would you like it on revenue or bit basis?
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs: Bits would be great.
Mark Adams: Okay. On a DRAM gigabyte basis - I am just going to pick some of the bigger categories, personal systems Q1 was about 40%, mobile was in the mid-30% range, server was in the mid-teens, and then the rest would be captured in networking and AIMM.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs: Great. That's very helpful. Then maybe as a follow-up, I believe and I may have not heard this right that you talked about the Singapore fab reaching wafer capacity transition, in the transition from DRAM to NAND. Did I hear that correctly? Then can you talk about when that might be fully transitioned at this point?
Mark Adams: That's right. We were over 50% in the quarter completed and the timing is still potentially variable, but I would look for that to complete out in first half of this calendar year.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs: Then just last one quickly for me.
Mark Adams: Sorry. Assuming no changes and as you know we have always maintained the flexibility there to make changes depending on market conditions, but as sit today, we anticipate completing that out in an orderly fashion.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs: Understand. Then last one for me would be, just in terms of the OpEx profile from here. I think you came in maybe a little bit under some of your targets. Can you maybe talk about going forward where there is opportunities either on the SG&A line or the R&D line to bring those down a little bit?
Mark Adams: I think there is some opportunity there over time. It came in a little under primarily, I think, in this current quarter we had some reduced legal expenses that were contributors to that, but on a go forward basis our focus on the R&D line right now is to make sure we make all the investments we need to support the business both from technology transition perspective as well as from a system-level solution enablement perspective, and so we are not looking to drive that down in a big hurry. On the SG&A front, I will let Ron comment.
Ron Foster: Yes. In terms of overall and as Mark mentioned, we did some timing differences quarter-to-quarter in terms of trends. For example our legal costs vary. If you see our guidance, Q2 is a little bit up from Q1, and also we have wafer qual cost timings that shift around and varied a little bit in Q1, came in lower in Q2 is probably more on a trend line just in terms of the near term views . In term of forward-looking cost structure, I think if you look at it as a percent of revenue, the way we are currently performing, we’ve talked about OpEx being in a 15% range and I think we can structurally run well below that going forward given current market conditions in SG&A would be commensurately lower as well, so on an absolute dollar standpoint, I wouldn't expect to see significant changes, but I do think as a percent of revenue we can trend in the range we are running now.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs: That's helpful. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Mehdi Hosseini - SIG: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Two. Starting with NAND, would you be able to elaborate the percentage of the revenue of bits coming from the embedded segment of the market?
Mark Adams: Yes. I can do that for you. In Q1, we don’t -- I am not going to be able to do that for you. Well, we just don't track them quite like that.
Mehdi Hosseini - SIG: Sure. Well, because you said in Q2, you are going to see a mix moving more towards embedded. I am just trying to get a better assessment of how that is going to impact the mix and the margin profile?
Ron Foster: Yes, let me maybe approach it like I did on the DRAM side, I will hit some big buckets for you, and again we don't necessarily include embedded, so that will be embedded applications within some of these different categories, but with that being said, Q1 SSDs would be around 50%. the consumer which includes channel and CPG for us is around 30%, mobile will be in the mid-teens. And then again, networking, storage, and AIM will make up the balance.
Mehdi Hosseini - SIG: Got it. So when I look at your NAND ASP and cost guide, it seems like margins are going to come down. ASP declined more than the cost decline. Is this trend going to reverse into the Q2 because of the mix changing or is that more of the ASP decline going to change? How should we think about the mix versus ASP versus cost into Q2?
Ron Foster: I think in general, we feel that we will improve our mix relative to the market after Q2. We are going, obviously, through a transition. I mentioned in my earlier comments about the output at our Fab 7 trying to align that to customer quality, and it is probably another three to six months dynamic ongoing. The other part that is worthy of note is that there is a natural ASP degradation, you are shifting SSDs to components. It might not be as much of a margin hit as much as ASP going down to the Bill of Materials lower and all that. So you have got the Fab 7 dynamic and just the mix dynamic that contribute to what assumes to be a decline in ASPs.
Mehdi Hosseini - SIG: If I may just add one more question for the big picture. In the Analyst Day in August, you talked about being more aggressive on acquisition, especially as you focus more on a system level storage. Can you give us an idea or any kind of flavor as where you are and help us understand or elaborate what kind of acquisition targets you are looking at?
Mark Durcan: Well, I think there is, obviously, as we build out our organization, we are doing a lot of that organically. We will continue to look at inorganic opportunities but certainly we are not in a position to go forecasting what, when, where or how any of that might happen?
Mehdi Hosseini - SIG: Is it more controller, is it more softer or is it more just offered acquiring talents, is what I am asking?
Mark Durcan: Well, we are acquiring talent across the spectrum to support those system level solutions. So you will note, in the last quarter we brought in some more senior leadership in the controller area with Brian Angell. We also brought in Tom Snodgrass in the system level storage solutions area and we will continue to bring in people up and down the organization whether they are software folks, firmware folks or hardware folks to support those efforts.
Mehdi Hosseini - SIG: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh from Sterne Agee.
Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee: When you look at your end markets between PC and smartphones, there is a lot of weakness. It looks like you guys had very good margins and there's good supply displayed. Do you expect to see that operating stability and discipline continue into 2014 even after Wuxi comes on?
Mark Adams: You know, we do. We think that the overall PC market feels like it's stabilizing a bit. At least from our customers' perspectives. The demand is pretty robust, as I mentioned earlier, quarter-to-date and we think that the balancing between that, not just the smartphone segment, we have got pretty good inroads into, what I would say, is the utility smartphone business that our customer breadth there is allowing us to diversify away. So we are not so heavily concentrated in the smartphone segment itself. So we don't necessarily feel that we are overly exposed to that dynamic you are referring to, post Wuxi coming back on. We feel pretty comfortable where we are at on the customer engagement model and what the customers are asking from Micron from a capacity standpoint.
Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee: Got it, and then Elpida, can you talk about regarding the cost synergy opportunities, let's say in test and packaging? And I also wanted to get your thoughts on the Yen, how you are looking at that side from there and then hedging there?
Mark Adams: On the packaging side, Elpida certainly has their own approach to packaging. So as we look at Micron going forward, we are drawing up our own strategy in terms of an internal and external approach, a hybrid approach to how we are assuming our product needs. A good way of thinking about this, or rather a simple way of thinking about it is, for some of the higher touch, higher value add products and applications more of that will be done in-house. And as we evaluate future opportunities, some of our more commoditized low-end business PC, mobile application, where they don't require a lot of touch and development will probably use some outside third-party to get that done.
Ron Foster: Vijay, on the yen and hedging question, I also make a couple of comments, see if I hit your point and ask for clarification if you want to go somewhere else with it. We use natural hedges in our Japan and Taiwan largely to protect our balance sheet along with some yen based forward contracts to protect us on our yen and our largest exposure as you probably know relates to a ¥140 billion creditor payments scheduled out over the next few years in Japan, so we use those hedging approaches, largely natural hedges, but some forward contracts to cover that. Another data point I might just mention is on operating cost structure of one yen change in the yen-dollar rate will affect our operating cost quarterly in the neighborhood $5 million to $7 million just as a reference.
Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee: Got it. [Good number].
Ron Foster: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Newman from Bernstein.
Mark Newman - Bernstein: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Good numbers today. My question is really on the NAND DRAM mix. Looking at the gross margins commonly I think both, NAND and DRAM are somewhere in the low-to-mid 30% gross margin, but currently with your ramp that you talked about in Singapore, the conversion of DRAM to NAND, is causing little bit of problem on the ASP side and gross margin for NAND looks like at least what you are saying for the ASP quarter-to-date seems to be down quite a bit. With that in mind, it looks like the NAND gross margin is going to be quite a bit below DRAM in the coming, quarter fiscal Q2 and perhaps beyond, so in that case I am wondering like how you think about that? You commented, I think, Mark Durcan, you commented that you may have some flexibility how you look at things and I am wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that considering the fact that the extra production that's coming out of the Singapore fab is causing pricing and margin to come down for your NAND segment and if you would consider to perhaps delay that conversion to ease that situation. Considering that DRAM is doing quite so well these days.
Mark Durcan: Thanks, Mark. It's a good question and one which obviously we think a lot about. I think the key here is we want to be careful we don't optimize a short-term at the expense of a long-term and we will continue to look at what the exact right balance is, but we think in terms of some of our challenges right now relative to NAND as we bring this new capacity online are more short-term oriented relative to enabling the customer socket and getting the product placed in the right place as opposed to a long-term supply/demand phenomenon. When we look at the long-term dynamic for NAND, we still think that's going to be pretty robust, so we will obviously keep a close eye on it and we do have flexibility, but as I mentioned earlier, our trajectory today is to continue to move towards closing that out in an orderly fashion over the next year.
Ron Foster: Just to add to that, Mark, as I think you numerically observed, but to be clear the current margins are pretty darn close to the same Q2. We might have a little bit of shift related to mix as Mark Adams commented about etcetera, but that's a short-term phenomenon so there's not a huge difference between the two right now.
Mark Newman - Bernstein: Got it, so basically your goal is - would you believe that this mix issue is a short-term issue and you believe that within three to six months as you said you are going to be ought to transition this extra production in Singapore towards more higher margin solution products and therefore the margin should then catch-up back to the kind of more similar to DRAM back to the mid-30s or even higher gross margins, so you think this in other words is more of a short-term issue?
Ron Foster: We do. When you think about coming online with a Fab 7 or anytime you bring on new capacity out of a fab, your customer qualification process is somewhat timely around their only products, so as we go through that our early output tends to go into more commodity homes in the short-term and as Ron just noted, it hasn't dramatically hit our margin in Q1. So we are in the process of qualifying major OEMs on this output and we think the timeframe is roughly three to six months that will get us back to a more stable margin profile that we can drive the right capacity into the right sockets.
Mark Newman - Bernstein: All right. That's very helpful, and I just have one further follow-up. You mentioned 3-D NAND schedule samples in the late Q1 and Q2. Can you clarify, you are talking about 2014?
Mark Adams: That's right. I am sorry about that. Yes, when I made the comment earlier, we are still on track and optimistic that a late Q1, early Q2 for production samples for 2014.
Mark Newman - Bernstein: For 3-D and any more comment on how you think 3-D NAND, how that will shape-out in the future in terms of potential mix or when production may ramp-up? What product categories would be with more higher end enterprise versus lower end lower cost? Any kind of comments you can help us in how to think about that?
Mark Adams: Well I can tell you little bit about how we see it. I think we think from 3-D volume perspective, we think it will be, for us, a broad spectrum of application usage. We are looking to, obviously, enable it in the high end and use it to our advantage to drive enterprise but the way we have architected our products is going to allow us to cover a full breadth. We think volume is probably back half of 2015 for 3-D and thus we think that where we are in our development, we are on track to do that.
Mark Newman - Bernstein: I see. So you have a broad set of segments, not specifically high-end or not specifically low-end? Do you think it will affect --
Mark Adams: Our design allow us to focus on a couple of key markets that we view as kind of high value for the sockets, but are limited into where we can take this over the long-term.
Mark Newman - Bernstein: Great, and thanks very much. Congratulations.
Operator: Thank you, and our next question comes from David Wong from Wells Fargo.
David Wong - Wells Fargo: Can you give us some idea what gross margin would have been if the inventory for Elpida had not been written-off in the November quarter?
Kipp Bedard: Yes, there was a reconciliation page and basically the stepped up inventory was $111 million.
David Wong - Wells Fargo: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Monika Garg from Pacific Crest.
Monika Garg - Pacific Crest: Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up question on the 3-D NAND. Could you maybe talk about when you target 3-D NAND, will you look at the cost structure? Is it below your planar NAND cost structure at that time? Or depending upon the applications maybe some applications need high end (inaudible), so you may ramp 3-D NAND just for that applications to begin with? Maybe just if could you talk about what is your strategy on the 3-D NAND side?
Mark Durcan: So let me try and characterize. Obviously, early on, as with any new technology, we are going to pick a couple of applications first, as Mark Adams mentioned a moment ago. Our technology, I think, as you look at different suppliers in the marketplace, different suppliers are taking different approaches to 3-D NAND technology. Some of them, as I think you are implying Monika, have limited performance on certain planes or parameters. Micron's technology, we believe, is more generally applicable to the full swap of applications currently being serviced by planar NAND. So we expect over time we will roll our 3-D NAND across the spectrum. And yes, of course, we believe, over time it will be significantly more cost effective than planar NAND given the scale that goes on with 3-D NAND.
Monika Garg - Pacific Crest: And then, if I heard it correctly, you said that volume ramp is in latter half of 2015.
Mark Durcan: Well, it's tough to pin that because we have to say what we mean by volume and all the details associated with that but yes, we believe it's a 2015 phenomenon for production ramp on 3-D NAND and significant in the marketplace, probably more or so in the second half than the first half.
Monika Garg - Pacific Crest: Okay, just a last question on the current pricing trends in the NAND market. At least what we see on the channel is slightly weak. Maybe could you talk about pricing trends in different segments in the NAND market?
Mark Adams: The way you have asked the question, the way we look at it, there are some parts of the NAND that have remained very strong and robust and there are some that have shown some of the weakness you are talking about. Some of that by the way is pretty natural out of the holidays, but it's not as severe as prior years necessarily. We also see some people who are exposed in the NAND business in the mobile market getting a little more aggressive with that capacity and the low-end client business, quite frankly, we are not going to play that game. In addition to moving the components to other application segments, we don't necessarily want to sell our business just to compete the market share perspective, where other people are trying to grab share on pricing, so independent of the Fab 7 dynamic I mentioned earlier, overall it's not bad NAND business, it's just there is pockets of weakness coming out of the holiday and with some softness where people are exposed.
Monika Garg - Pacific Crest: Thank you so much. That's all for me.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer, Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead, sir.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the good results. Guys, just relative to the November quarter, I think you said there was $250 million benefit or prepay of DRAM from a customer, I am kind of curious one did that product ship? I guess given that we are all worried about Wuxi coming back online and DRAM pricing going lower, what's the motivation behind the customer actually coming into a contract at today's pricing?
Mark Adams: Well, as we commented on earlier, the way we plan our business is basically with a full Wuxi fab capacity in the market. As Mark Durcan commented on earlier, we have got kind of bit of a shift in dynamic with certainly Wuxi coming on at some point. We don't know when that is, but some point in the future but offset partially by our continued Fab 7 conversion. If you put that altogether and balance with industry up at about mid-20% range of DRAM bit growth of the year, we think that's in line. We don't think that's going to drive a significant oversupply in the market and we think the customer see that too, so as customers look for 2014 sourcing, as they think about kind of when Wuxi may or may not come online, they are trying to lock up capacity and commitment and are going to make it through as - future calendar 2014.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Mark, that's helpful. When does the product ship?
Mark Adams: We don't want to get into detail, but it's kind of over a longer period. The intent was to secure output over a long cycle, not in a specific quarter for example.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Great. That's helpful then guys in the prepared comments I think you mentioned that you shifted SSD enterprise drive this November quarter. Was that sample or was that actually true shipment of revenue? I am just kind of curious how do we think about the enterprise SSD as a percent of overall SSD mix? Any targets you can share with us for this fiscal year and how should we think about the gross margin differential between enterprise SSD and consumer SSD? Thank you.
Mark Adams: Well, let me answer your first question. It was a sample on the M500 DC product. It was based on our 20 nanometer technology. As we look at it, as I mentioned in terms of the NAND behavior in terms of ASPs and market, on the higher density in the enterprise market obviously we would like to drive as much of our capacity to that segment. Where customers who have got exposure into the high end smartphone business have capacity, what we are seeing is some aggressive pricing in the client business and we are going to take a look at that versus our retail business which is doing pretty well, and versus our component business and versus other application segments, so we don't necessarily want to go head-to-head and try to compete truly on price in the client business. If you look at our client business, on its own merit, our average densities in client are much higher than the market and because we are trying to keep that above, what I would say, the trading client business, which again you have got a lot of capacity in the high end smartphone business that's exposed, you might be bit more aggressive in the [business].
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Perfect. Thanks. Again, congratulations again.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox from Cross Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Steven Fox - Cross Research: Thanks. Good afternoon. Just a couple of quick clarifications from me, on the yen part for the current quarter, can you just give us a sense of what you are assuming and how much of a benefit it is quarter-over-quarter to expenses? Secondly, in terms of just looking at the Elpida cash margins, I don't know, maybe I missed it, but are you being specific about where they exactly were in the quarter? And then lastly, can you just talk about, I think, you said it is still early on in getting Elpida integration integrated fully. Can you talk about what else is coming, maybe between now and the end of the calendar year?
Ron Foster: Sure, Steven. With regard to the Yen, if you are talking about our forward view, Q1 to Q2, we don't typically assume any exchange rate changes in our outlooks as we give guidance going forward, if that's what you were looking for.
Steven Fox - Cross Research: Yes, so it's a benefit, quarter-over-quarter. Is that correct? Like versus what you just reported?
Ron Foster: Yes.
Steven Fox - Cross Research: Okay.
Ron Foster: In terms of your question on Elpida cash margins, we are not going to give any more detail on Elpida specifically other than as we mentioned we met or in general, exceeded our projections we gave in August and that was a pretty good outcome in terms of flowing that through our business and getting it combined with overall Micron.
Steven Fox - Cross Research: Great, and then just on the roadmap for Elpida integration, please?
Mark Adams: Sure. I don't think there is anything alarming to the process. I think what the comments on integration are that the teams is coming together, they are working pretty well. Of course, we have got the 25-nanometer ramp ongoing as well, as I talked about, second half of the year 20-nanometer product in the market. So as it relates to the focus of the team and just the timeliness of the integration efforts with engineering teams coming together, the marketing organizations coming together, looking at market segment optimization with that team as part of Micron has actually been very helpful for us because of the dynamic between the mobile and computing bit optimization we talked about from an ASP and wafer, our perspective. So a lot of normal stuff in integration that we feel pretty positive about and I think the customers see the breadth and the opportunity for flexibility in our portfolio whether it would be in the mobile portfolio or the pure computing portfolio.
Kipp Bedard: Thanks, Mark. And I think we have time for one more caller.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Cassidy from Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Dean Grumlose - Stifel Nicolaus: This is Dean Grumlose calling in for Kevin. Thanks very much for squeezing me in here. My question is, can you provide a little extra color on the relative performance and demand in the server segment. I think we often talk about PC and mobile, but how strong is that segment in terms of demand perspective and what do you see going forward?
Mark Adams: Yes. I am sorry. This is Mark Adams. We continue to be very bullish on the server market, really primarily for two reasons. One, which is the applications driving at the data center, cloud computing dynamic, coupled with as much DRAM as they can put in the servers they are putting into the bit growth in servers last year continues to play into this year's numbers and we are seeing significant bit growth in the 50% to 60% range in the server market. So we feel pretty good about that business and it has been very stable and we have been capturing more share quarter-over-quarter for five to six quarters and starting to get in the and setting server market records.
Dean Grumlose - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, and as a quick follow-up on the Inotera cost structure arrangement. Does it matter at all which segment the device is for or what else can you provide as insight to how that works?
Ron Foster: So Dean, this is Ron. In terms of the Inotera structure, we don't get into a lot of details on it, but as I think we have commented, it's an averaging pricing mechanism looking at past three months on a moving average basis. So there is a lag defect as that flows through and then in general, we neutralize differences in mix so that we have the complete flexibility to move whatever products where we want in our system. So it doesn't have an difference fundamentally in our pricing or transfer pricing as a result of mix.
Dean Grumlose - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you so much.
Kipp Bedard: Thanks, Dean. With that, we would like to thank everyone for participating on the call today. If you will please bear with me, I need to repeat the Safe Harbor protection language.

I'd like to now turn the call over to Mark Durcan. Mark?
Mark Durcan: Thanks, Kipp. I'd like to start today with an overview of the key developments during the quarter, followed by a few strategic and industry thoughts. Then I'll turn it over to Ron for a financial summary. And before turning to Q&A, we'll close our prepared comments with Mark Adams covering additional details of our business units and operational performance and market conditions. Our fourth fiscal quarter was highlighted by the long anticipated closing of the Elpida acquisition. I want to thank all our team members, whether from Micron, Elpida or Rexchip for all their hard work getting us to this point. While we were able to get a good head start on planning and technology development, integration is now in full swing and we hit the ground running with solid combined financial performance in Q4. We expect this execution to continue in Q1 as we take advantage of the strong market conditions along with enhanced scale technology, cost and customer positioning. Our DRAM business roughly doubled overnight as Elpida and Rexchip delivered scale in the PC segment and a leading mobile product portfolio that dovetails nicely with Micron's strength and other specialty DRAM categories such as networking, server and [AIM]. We were also very happy with the performance of our new Japanese team in the graphics arena and expect significant growth in that segment driven by next generation gaming consoles hitting the market soon. Mobile DRAM is now in the mid to high 30% range of our DRAM bits with PC in a similar range and server in the mid-teens. While consumer, networking and storage and [AIM] are all in the single-digits as a percentage of bits, they remain higher than that in terms of revenue. In summary, we have a large product portfolio in every critical segment of the DRAM market and we will now turn our focus to optimizing margins and returns. Turning to the NAND business, we're building a large and solid foundation in SSDs, both through the expansion of our own SSD product lines as well as through strategic customer engagement in the space. Micron branded SSDs and sales of strategic SSD customers now consume in aggregate over 60% of our NAND trade bit. We also have a margin driven retail business and are focusing on a growing set of opportunities to expand the high value embedded -- expand in the high value embedded applications. The wireless NOR market continues a moderate decline as predicted, but embedded NOR remains very attractive, and we're driving profitable growth there. We recently entered into an agreement to sell our 200 millimeter NOR fab in Israel, and we've started moving NOR production to Singapore and to our 300 millimeter fab in Virginia. This will enable significant cost reductions going forward while still providing ample capacity to service the market. Comparing our major technology categories for the quarter, trade NAND achieved gross margins in the low 30% range, followed by DRAM in the mid-20s and NOR in the high-single digits. As Ron will describe in more detail, the reported DRAM margins from the newly acquired capacity appears lower initially as both WIPs and finished goods at close were written up to reflect anticipated market prices. This purchase price accounting effect should flow through over the next quarter or so. We continue to make capital and segmentation decisions to optimize margins and free cash flow over time. Operating cash flow of $717 million [excluded] (ph) our disciplined and measured capital expenditures of $332 million in the quarter. Both these numbers include one month of Elpida financials. The Micron-only fiscal 2013 CapEx of $1.4 billion came in at the low-end of our updated guidance range as we deferred spending into 2014. As a result, our 2014 guidance of $2.6 billion to $3.2 billion is actually somewhat above what we believe the normal run rate for our business should be. Conditions remained favorable for strong memory industry fundamentals. In NAND, we're projecting industry supply this year up in the low 40% range with next year very similar. The 2014 projection includes about a 10% increase in industry wafer production with our remaining supply growth coming from technology. This supply forecast compares to the five-year NAND demand CAGR of 43%, implying a favorable supply and demand balance. Micron's total NAND supply growth will be below the industry this year and slightly above next year, given our DRAM to NAND conversion in Singapore. Mark Adams will comment on the status and solid execution going on there. For DRAM, we expect to see declining industry wafers over the next 12 months with a recent fire at one of our competitor’s fabs amplifying this effect. Clearly, the fire is impacting and will continue to impact supply in the market as the fab in total, including potentially unimpacted capacity, represents about 13% of industry DRAM capacity. We are working with our customers to assist them where possible, but we're not currently changing any of our production plans as a result of the fire. Without making any major assumptions for the impact of the fire, we are projecting DRAM industry supply up in the mid-20% range this year and a similar range next year. The current DRAM five-year demand CAGR is in the low 30s implying a favorable long-term market situation there also. Micron's total DRAM bit production, including Elpida, should be slightly above the industry this year and below the industry next year. This includes the impact of our DRAM to NAND conversion plans. It was a rewarding quarter at Micron, but much remains to be done. While the Elpida acquisition positions us as the world's best memory supplier and the industry dynamics are moving in our favor, we remain focused on optimizing value for our shareholders and worldwide customers. I'll stop here and turn it over to Ron and Mark before returning for Q&A.
Ronald Foster: Thanks, Mark. Our fourth quarter and fiscal year ended on August 29. Our website has a schedule containing certain key results for the fourth quarter as well as guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2014. That information is also presented on the following slides. For our 2013 fiscal year, we reported net income of $1.2 billion or $1.13 per diluted share on net sales of $9.1 billion. The results for the year include one month of the consolidated results of Elpida since our acquisition closed on July 31. Elpida's results included Rexchip. The $1.5 billion non-operating gain recognized as part of the purchase accounting of Elpida is the result of the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired being in excess of the purchase price. Operating income for 2013, which excludes the gain on the Elpida acquisition, improved to $236 million compared to an operating loss of $612 million in fiscal 2012 as market conditions for memory products improved significantly around the beginning of this calendar year. The schedule currently displayed summarizes the purchase accounting for Elpida. Several noteworthy items include. The $2.4 billion net assets acquired includes $3 billion of net working capital. Both cash and inventories were each just under $1 billion. The amount of inventory as of closing was written up as part of the purchase accounting to its fair value which Mark mentioned, and is based on the estimated selling prices for the products. As a result of this write up, we expect lower margins on sales of Elpida products in the first few months following the acquisition as we sell through the material that was subject to the write-up. Normal margins should return around the end of the first fiscal quarter. The amount of property, plant, and equipment consolidated -- for consolidated Elpida, including the fabs in Hiroshima and Taiwan was $935 million. This reflects an approximately $2.1 billion reduction through purchase accounting compared to the U.S. GAAP values immediately prior to the acquisition. In addition, you may recall that the U.S. GAAP PP&E values of consolidated Elpida were previously written down by $2.8 billion through an impairment charge in the Elpida March 2012 financial statements. Other current and non-current assets include about $920 million of net deferred tax assets, such as net operating loss carry forwards which will be used over time to offset Japan income tax obligations. Total acquired debt, giving effect to the plan of reorganization, is $2.1 billion. Our payment to acquire Elpida of 60 billion Yen or approximately US$615 million is shown on the balance sheet in restricted cash. Approximately $560 million of this balance will be used to make the first installment payment to the creditors later this month. The total installment payments due under the plan of reorganization of 200 billion Yen bears no interest. However, they have been discounted to a fair value of $1.638 billion using an imputed interest rate of 6.25%. Concurrent with the closing of the Elpida acquisition, we also acquired Powerchip's 24% interest in Rexchip. Along with Elpida's ownership, we acquired a total of 89% of Rexchip. The remaining 11% represents substantially all of the non-controlling interest valued at $168 million reflected in the opening balance sheet. The SEC disclosure rules require us to file certain historical financial statements of Elpida, along with pro forma financial statements. We anticipate filing those documents next week. That filing will contain audited Elpida financial statements as of and for the fiscal period ended February 28, 2013, as well as pro forma financial statements from Micron's fiscal 2012 and the nine months ended May 31, 2013. The pro forma financial statements contain additional detailed disclosures of the purchase accounting for Elpida. Further details of the actual purchase accounting will be included in our 10-K, which will be filed later this month. For the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $1.7 billion or $1.51 per diluted share on net sales of $2.8 billion. Obviously, these results include the $1.5 billion acquisition gain. Operating income for the fourth quarter of $207 million improved from $149 million in the third quarter, primarily due to an approximately 1 percentage point expanded gross margin and $46 million operating income contributed by Elpida, which includes the net effects of higher cost of goods sold from the stepped up inventory value, partially offset by lower depreciation from the equipment values that were written down in purchase accounting. These factors were partially offset by acquisition costs and restructuring impairment charges incurred at the Micron level during the quarter, which are enumerated on the following slide. On a standalone basis, Elpida's consolidated results for the one month that was included in our fiscal Q4 included revenue of $355 million with 25% gross margin. Elpida's net income for the one month period was $29 million. We are continuing to present items included in the results of operations for the quarter that are particularly noteworthy or are not representative of company's trended economic performance. These items are presented to reconcile net income for the period as reported to net income excluding these certain items. Note that the amounts in the reconciliation do not include all the related income tax effects as the amounts are generally di minimis due to our net operating loss carry forwards and our global tax structure. The most prominent item in the reconciliation is the gain recognized on the Elpida acquisition. Going the other way are the flow through in the fourth quarter of a portion of the stepped-up inventory value in the acquisition, in addition to the acquisition-related costs incurred in the quarter. We recognized restart -- restructuring and impairment charges of $32 million, primarily from employee termination benefits associated with workforce reductions as we continue to optimize our global workforce structure and write-downs of certain assets in our Israel operation associated with their pending sale. The amortization of debt discount primarily reflects the imputed interest expense in the quarter from our convertible notes, as well as the discount on the interest free installment debt of Elpida. Last quarter, we mentioned a gain we were to recognize in the fourth quarter of $48 million associated with our ownership in Inotera, as they sold shares to other parties at a price higher than our carrying value. The net effect of foreign currency activity was significantly reduced in the fourth quarter as we began hedging Elpida's non-USD exposures under our normal hedging policies as of the close of the acquisition. We expect to see some ongoing activity in this area, since we fully incorporated Elpida's balance sheet exposures, including the yen-denominated installment debt. Non-cash income tax expenses primarily in Japan are offset by the deferred tax asset we recorded in purchase accounting. Adjusting for all these items, non-GAAP EPS improved to $0.29 per diluted share compared to the $0.16 per diluted share, adjusting for items in the third quarter. You may have noted here as well as on previous slides the number of shares used in diluted EPS calculation has increased in the fourth quarter. The average stock price for the quarter increased the dilution from our convertible notes and stock options, both of which use the treasury stock method to determine the amount of dilution. The number of shares used in the diluted EPS calculation for the fourth quarter, includes 96 million shares from the dilutive effects of convertible notes and shares under our stock plans. The capped calls that we have in place around our convertible notes while not reflected in the EPS calculation, economically reduced the dilution from the convertible notes by approximately 53 million shares at an assumed $18 share price. As our share price exceeds the upper strike price of the capped calls, their mitigating effect on the dilution is capped. As always, we are reviewing alternatives to manage our capital structure and we'll take advantage of opportunities we believe are in the best interest of our shareholders. In the first quarter we project the following impacts from these adjustment items. Flow through of Elpida inventory step up reducing gross margin by $110 million to $120 million, Amortization of debt discount on the convertible notes and the Elpida installment debt of approximately $15 million. Non-cash taxes related to the acquisition of between $50 million to $60 million. Our ongoing cash tax rate is expected to be in the low single digit range. We expect restructuring and acquisition costs in the first quarter to be immaterial in the single-digit million dollar range. Now, the more detailed discussion of our operating results will be at the combined company level, including the results of Elpida. In terms of the guidance that we provided for the fourth quarter, we generally executed within the targeted ranges we provided. Going forward, all of our guidance for the future periods will also be at the consolidated company level. Turning first to DRAM. DRAM revenue for the combined company increased 50% in the fourth quarter compared to the previous quarter, reflecting a 42% increase in bit sales volume and 5% increase in per bit average selling prices. One month of Elpida's results accounted for approximately 20% of the total bit shipments in the fourth quarter. The mix of Elpida's products averaged to a lower price when compared to Micron's average price. This is primarily a result of Micron's higher mix of premium ASP segments, such as networking and [AIM], while Elpida has a higher mix of sales in wafer form. Currently, Elpida sells approximately 20% of their volume in wafers which reduces the consolidated Micron average selling price and cost per bit correspondingly. The cost for DRAM products increased in the fourth quarter compared to the previous quarter, mainly due to the higher cost of products purchased from Inotera which vary based on market prices. Our quarterly results also reflect our share of Inotera's net income. This is the first quarter since 2010 where equity method pick-up reflects income from Inotera, where execution in addition to the improvements in the memory industry has helped their return to profitability. Recall that we pick up Inotera's equity method results with a two month lag. Now in terms of guidance for DRAM. Using quarter-to-date selling prices and projected product mix effects for the quarter, ASPs will be up mid-single digits compared to the Q4 average as a result of market increases, partially offset by the mix effect of lower Elpida average selling prices. Projected bit costs are expected to be down low single digits relative to Q4, with the Elpida mix improving cost per bit, partially offset by higher costs from Inotera's market based pricing. Projected production volume is expected to be up mid-40s in the first quarter with a full three months of Elpida volume. We expect Elpida to account for approximately 60% of DRAM bit production in the first quarter. Key themes affecting Q1 guidance include the relatively strong market conditions for DRAM pricing that Mark referenced and the continued transition of the former tech Singapore fab from DRAM to NAND. This transition is on track and expected to continue through the end of the fiscal year. Now turning to NAND, Trade NAND sales increased 3% compared to the third quarter, which reflects 13% increase in bit sales volumes, offset by a 9% decrease in per bit average selling price. Margin on Trade NAND remained flat compared to the third quarter as the transition to higher density products brought about the offsetting effects of lower cost per part and lower per bit selling prices. NAND bits sold in Micron branded SSD increased 23% in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by growth in the enterprise space as we continued to build out our product portfolio in this key segment which Mark Adams will talk about more in a bit. Looking at our NAND guidance for the first quarter, using quarter to-date selling prices and projected mix for the quarter, Trade NAND ASPs would be down high-single digits with the decline driven by mix of higher density products on advanced technology nodes. Bit costs are expected to be down high-single digits as well, while bit production is expected to be up low to mid-teens as we transition our former tech Singapore fab to NAND production. Key transfer Q1 affecting this guidance are the continued ramp of the former tech Singapore fab to NAND, although the majority of the output in the fourth quarter was still DRAM. And as NAND replaced to some NOR volume in the marketplace over time, I’ll also add that revenue from NOR sales is expected to decline sequentially in Q1 as it did in Q4 to the $120 million to $130 million range. SG&A expense guidance for Micron only in the fourth quarter did not include any acquisition-related costs. Adjusting for the $42 million acquisition-related costs in the quarter, SG&A was right in the middle of our guided range. We expect SG&A expense in the first quarter to be between $185 million and $195 million, including Elpida's costs. R&D expense for Micron only in the fourth quarter was at the high end of our guided range. Including Elpida for all the first quarter, we expect R&D expense to be between $340 million and $350 million. The Company also generated $717 million in cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter. The year ended with cash and investments, including restricted cash and non-current investments of $4.2 billion. This amount includes the Elpida restricted cash of which approximately $560 million will be paid in the first installment payment later this month, as I mentioned previously. Micron only capital spending during the fourth quarter was $286 million, which brought the fiscal year total to $1.4 billion at the low-end of our most recently guided range as Mark mentioned and well below our original guidance for the year. Capital spending for the fourth quarter, including Elpida, was $332 million. Estimated capital expenditures for fiscal 2014 of between $2.6 billion and $3.2 billion, contemplates all the spending for the Elpida and Rexchip operations, as we converge on our technology and product roadmaps. Depreciation and amortization is expected to increase from $486 million in the fourth quarter to around $560 million in Q1. During the fourth quarter, we received just over $300 million in additional asset-backed debt financing. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark Adams for his comments.
Mark Adams: Thanks, Ron. I will provide some more detail on our fourth quarter operating performance, as well as, share some thoughts on current market conditions. Our NAND Solutions Group recorded revenue of $781 million, up 7% when compared to our third quarter. Total NAND gross margins increased slightly in the quarter as we continue to improve our mix. Our NAND ASPs were down 9% quarter-over-quarter, partially driven by an increase in higher density, lower price per gigabyte SSD products and partially driven by early production capacity from our fab seven conversion, ending up in a transactional market such as memory cards and USB devices which generally produce a lower ASP. Our SSD business is growing significantly faster than the overall SSD market. Micron branded SSD revenue for the year was 76% over 2012. It's worth noting that over 50% of our trade NAND revenue goes to either Micron branded SSDs or our strategic customers who serve the SSD category with Micron's NAND technology. We continued to migrate our SSD product family to advanced lithography nodes. Our 20-nanometer flash memory technology represented 40% of our client SSD shipments and our 25-nanometer process represented over 80% of our enterprise shipments. Our newly announced M500 based on our 20-nanometer technology is seeing strong acceptance not only in client, but data center applications. We've also qualified two new enterprise drives at Tier-1 OEMs, our P410 flash drive and our P420 PCIe drive. On the technology front, Micron introduced its industry leading 16-nanometer MLC NAND, the most advanced processing node for any current product produced in the semiconductor device industry. For this accomplishment, Micron won the Best Technology Award, at the 2013 Flash Memory Summit held in August. We're pleased with the results from our NAND business and continue to look for ways to drive higher value features and functionalities to an increasingly segmented market. Our DRAM Solutions Group recorded a 34% increase in top line revenue, with sales of $1.24 billion in Q4, which included one month of Elpida data. Excluding this Elpida sales for August, revenue was up 16% quarter-on-quarter, driven primarily by an increase in DRAM ASPs for the second consecutive quarter. DSG gross margins were in the mid-20% range, up about 1% from our third quarter. Keep in mind that Q4 and Q1 DRAM gross margins are and in the near term will be negatively impacted by the flow through of Elpida's inventory which was written up to market value at close as Ron described in his purchase accounting comments earlier. We achieved record bit shipments in all of our premium DRAM segments, with the non-PC business representing about 55% of our gigabit shipments in the quarter. We shipped over 300 million gigabit equivalents into the server DRAM segment in Q4, driven by strong demand from our data center customers and cloud service providers. For fiscal 2013, this is a 53% year-over-year increase in bit shipments, which represented a 13% increase in revenue. We had a record quarter in our networking business for both bits up 5% and revenue up 8%. RLDRAM shipments set a company record as we’re seeing a strong demand from Tier-1 OEMs, as well as through our distribution channel. We also had a strong quarter in our consumer graphic segment, which continues to be an attractive premium market. Bit shipments were up 38% quarter-on-quarter and we expect strong demand in Q1, in particular looking forward to the upcoming launch of next-generation gaming consoles for this holiday season. Elpida's GDDR5 technology rounds out our portfolio in this fast-growing segment. On the technology front, we recently announced our Hybrid Memory Cube interoperability with FPGA platform from Altera, a major milestone for us in this new solution for the high-performance networking and computing segment. In addition, our RLDRAM III product continues to receive strong market endorsement from out Tier-1 networking customers. We are seeing strong yield improvement in our 25-nanometer process technology and will continue to ramp this technology through fiscal 2014. We are also on track to introduce our 20-nanometer technology beginning in the second half of calendar 2014. Overall the DRAM market remains tight. Given growing demand in the specialty markets and under supply in the PC DRAM business and the impact on supplies from the Wuxi accident, inventories appears extremely low across both our OEM customer base and at distribution channel. We are on allocation with customers in multiple segments. OEM contract pricing, while increasing, continues to lag the rising spot market. Our specialty business typically lags the market in terms of price movement, but we are seeing increases across these segments as well. We are optimistic that the DRAM market will remain strong through the end of calendar year 2013. When you include one month of Elpida's mobile business, revenue for the Wireless Solutions Group was up 70% quarter-over-quarter, coming up on Q3 where revenue was up roughly 30% from the prior quarter. Without the Elpida impact, revenues for WSG were flat quarter-over-quarter as we were able to redirect some capacity to higher margin opportunities in computing. Q4 gross margins swung from a negative 4% to a positive 8% in the quarter. Mobile DRAM was up 300% quarter-over-quarter, including Elpida, highlighted by increased low-power DRAM share at Tier-1 customers. Mobile DRAM margins improved significantly in Q4 on increased shipments of our 30-nanometer low-power DRAM product. Our mobile NAND revenue was constrained in the quarter, but gross margins were up mid-single digits compared to Q3. Our NOR based MCP business saw demand continue to decline with margin pressure from idle charges. In the past, I've talked about the restructuring of our Micron only mobile business, WSG. We have taken significant costs out of the business and managed our mobile inventory to an all-time low as we prepare for the integration of Elpida's mobile business with WSG. We feel as one combined mobile business, Micron has the strongest mobile memory portfolio in the industry. We are excited about the combined mobile organization scale and product breadth in both low power DRAM and managed NAND, positioning Micron as a leader in mobile memory solutions. Our Embedded Solutions Group recorded sales of $329 million, up 8% quarter-over-quarter, setting a record for ESG quarterly revenue. Investment in geographic expansion continues to pay off as we saw double-digit growth in both Europe and Asia. Operating profit remained strong at 19% as our team concluded a solid fiscal year 2013. For the year, revenue was up 13% in our embedded business, as we grew shipments across DRAM, NAND and NOR to a broadening customer base. Our automotive and industrial segment experienced 19% top line growth year-over-year. With the recent announcement of our field system labs in Germany and Shanghai, we feel we are uniquely positioned to partner with our embedded customers in presale systems architectural design, qualification and post-sale support. This level of customer engagement is the type of service that will continue to differentiate Micron's offering as we look to scale our embedded business. On the technology front, the team has done a great job marketing Micron's broad portfolio in a segment that was once dominated primarily by NOR shipments. In fact, today our ESG revenue mix is relatively evenly split between DRAM, NAND and NOR. We are currently ramping our 45-nanometer serial and parallel NOR products at our 300 millimeter fab in Virginia and we are in qualification with key ESG customers. We remain optimistic that we will see continued growth from ESG in fiscal 2014 as we increase investments in both technology and levels of differentiated service. Overall, the memory business remained in favorable balance from a demand and supply perspective throughout our fourth quarter. Demand signals from our customers are strong and we are in allocation mode across DRAM with general balance in NAND. The teams were able to execute in key areas such as specialty DRAM, enterprise storage, automotive and industrial and low-power mobile solutions in Q4 and we feel well positioned for a strong Q1. In closing, I want to welcome our new team members from the former Elpida and Rexchip teams. We are very impressed with the quality of people, technology, and strong customer relationships that are now part of Micron. With that, I will hand it back over to Kipp.
Kipp Bedard: Thank you, Mark. What we'd like to do now is take questions from callers. (Operator instructions). Please open up the lines.
Operator: (Operator instructions). Our first question will come from the line of Glen Young with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Adeline Lee – Citigroup: This is Adeline Lee for Glen Young. My first question is, can you tell us a little bit about your CapEx split and also CapEx loading?
Mark Durcan: This is Mark. We gave you already the CapEx spend projected for the year. In terms of how that's split technology wise, a little bit more than half on DRAM with the remainder to build out incremental 80 and 90 series NAND conversion which is 20 -- conversion to 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer as well as some early spend on 3D NAND.
Adeline Lee – Citigroup: And then can you also sort of help us in terms of ASPs. After the Wuxi fire at Hynix, what do you think pricing will do before -- when they get back to their normal loading sometime in the first half of 2014? What do you think pricing will do?
Mark Adams: This is Mark Adams. As we typically don't do, we’ll not comment on future pricing. There’s a lot of variables we just don't have a handle on in terms of what the competitive recovery would look like. Obviously, we are in a situation that since then up until quarter to-date, it's further tightened, was a tightening market, but we're not in a position of predicting future pricing.
Mark Durcan: Yeah, I think as well as that, I would just add that it's still a little unclear to us at least exactly when there will be a full recovery, so trying to get the dynamics around how that all plays out over time is very difficult.
Operator: Our next question in queue will come from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Monika Garg – Pacific Crest Securities: Your operating margins on DRAM segments are much higher than the NAND segment. And you're also guiding to ASP increase in DRAM and ASP decline in NAND. So the question is then why not delay the conversion of Singapore fab from DRAM to NAND for maybe a quarter or two quarters?
Mark Durcan: What I said, Monika is that we haven't changed our trajectory yet. And what we said in the past is we want to maintain a high degree of flexibility and be reactive to our customer needs and what's going on in the marketplace, so we can optimize margins. So, I'm not going to comment on what we might do going forward. We're going to continue to watch the market pretty carefully and do what we need to do for Micron and our customers.
Monika Garg – Pacific Crest Securities: The next one is on the WSG segment. The revenues increased considerably of course due to Elpida's mobile DRAM business, but operating margins are still in the negative, right? So I'm just trying to understand the dynamics there. Is it that inventory because of that lower gross margin from Elpida assets? Could you just walk a little bit on that side please?
Mark Adams: There is that. I think you're hitting on a couple of areas that are relevant, but also remember there’s a three months, basically a full quarter inventory flow through which will be much more positive when we get through that period as well.
Ronald Foster: There is also one month in there of Elpida in the reported results.
Mark Adams: Let me take this chance also just to comment that in the mobile business, we are currently -- we are strategically looking at a margin business, not a scale business. And so where we see opportunities to use our capacity for specialized and differentiated product in mobile, that's what we're focused on. We're not trying to necessarily grow the top line in mobile just to grow it, and I think from our perspective, when you add all those factors together, you'll continue to see hopefully us make announcements around differentiated products.
Operator: Our next question in the phone queue will come from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Joseph Moore – Morgan Stanley: The 17% growth in NAND bits, you had talked about production up high single-digits early in the quarter. Was that from inventory or did you have upside from the production numbers that you thought you'd have?
Mark Durcan: Yes, Joe, you're correct. That was actually reported a production number. So, production numbers came in even better. I think Mark mentioned in his script that in particular we were pleased to see that the 20-nanometer NAND is now more than 50% of our bits produced. So we’re pretty pleased with how the team executed.
Mark Adams: Looping back also, Joe to the tech conversion, again while we’re going to monitor that as the market continues to evolve, that transition went better than we ever could have possibly expected, that the yields are phenomenal there, and it’s been very, very smooth.
Joseph Moore – Morgan Stanley: And then in terms of the tax rate that you talked about, at the analyst meeting you guys have talked about the disparity between kind of a cash tax rate and then the non-GAAP from the true up of the NOLs around fair value, are we going to be able to get visibility into what the difference is between those two tax rates going forward?
Ronald Foster: Joe, this is Ron. I showed you the effect in the latest reported quarter, and I gave you a projection for the first quarter, so we will continue to pro forma that each quarter and give you the breakdown. The fact is that it's easier for us to actually project the cash tax rate and it’s going to be in the low-single digit range over time, because of our tax structure and that’s what we'll actually be paying in taxes. The GAAP tax rate is more difficult to figure out because it's an estimated effective tax rate based upon your projected annual profits or pre-tax profits. So I can give you a pretty good diagnosis of cash tax rates, and in each quarter we'll break out the non-cash portion that's in our GAAP number.
Operator: Our next question in queue comes from the line of Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Doug Freedman – RBC Capital Markets: Congrats on all the execution of all the moving parts here. Is there any way you can help me get what the gross margins would have been if you had recorded Elpida product at manufacturing cost as opposed to the marked up?
Mark Durcan: Doug, if you look at my schedule on the pro forma, you should be able to pull that out because we’ve showed the step up amount of the inventory around $40 million for the fourth quarter, $41 million on the non-GAAP schedule that I provided when I made my prepared comments, so that's the difference.
Doug Freedman – RBC Capital Markets: So it's not a significant number this quarter?
Mark Durcan: Pardon me?
Doug Freedman – RBC Capital Markets: So it ends up – great. The $41 million, it's not going to move my gross margins multiple percentage points this quarter. Going forward though it will have a more material --
Mark Durcan: Going forward, I gave you the estimate, $110 million to $120 million in Q1.
Doug Freedman – RBC Capital Markets: And then I just want to make sure I heard it correctly. You were talking Inotera bits, even post-acquisition integration, Inotera bits in DRAM are going to make up 60%. Did I hear that correctly?
Mark Durcan: No. In DRAM, Elpida bits make ups -- would be make up around 60% of our production in Q1 of DRAM production.
Doug Freedman – RBC Capital Markets: How much is Inotera?
Mark Durcan: Well, it's a part of the remainder, the larger part of the remainder.
Doug Freedman – RBC Capital Markets: Because those bits are at the cost plus accounting method?
Ronald Foster: Market minus.
Mark Durcan: The Inotera bits are market minus, and Elpida is part of our consolidated result. So, does that address your question?
Doug Freedman – RBC Capital Markets: It does. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question in queue will come from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Steven Fox – Cross Research: It seems like once again your business in the enterprise market is better than you would have thought of three months ago. Just curious if you could talk especially on the SSD side, you mentioned some of the product successes. As you look out into this quarter, where do you see that going? Then secondly, on the server side, I wonder if you can give some more color around where you're being successful on the DRAM sales because again it looked it was doing better than you would have thought three months ago. Thanks.
Mark Adams:
 :
Steven Fox – Cross Research: Just a follow-up along that line. You mentioned [web scale] customers as being part of the driver. And I think you've also talked about the risks around the linearity of those customers. Is that something that played out in the quarter at all? Do you expect that to play out in calendar fourth quarter? How do you see that market evolving near-term?
Mark Adams: So far until quarter-to-date, we think that it's been mildly capacity constrained with good capacity bits being able to serve that space. So we haven't seen any detriment to suggest otherwise. Again, I think we're getting some tailwinds on customer engagements in this business with our product portfolio that again we feel pretty positive and bullish going forward.
Steven Fox – Cross Research: And then just wrapping all that, I was just curious, as you apply all that to margins, how do you feel in terms of products, whether it’s SSDs or selling in the server market where -- are your margins optimized at this point in either product line or would you say there is room to improve there? Thanks.
Mark Adams: Yeah, again, we probably won't touch that one in terms of future margins and future ASPs.
Operator: Our next question in queue will come from the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
James Schneider – Goldman Sachs: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the capacity plans at Elpida, Hiroshima fab and also Rexchip in terms of what shrinks you're going to do over the next couple of quarters with the CapEx and transitions both on the mobile and PC DRAM side.
Mark Durcan: This is Mark Durcan. At Elpida, we have a 25-nanometer ramp well underway and that's going quite smoothly. There has been some early activity at Rexchip as well, although that would go maybe at a more muted pace. And we'll continue to monitor how we have our computing and DRAM mix and that may get things more than technology introduction at Rexchip as we try and get that mix right. But generally speaking we have product running at both those fabs and the 25-nanometer node. 20-nanometer is really a second calendar half of 2014 story. There will be activity in the first half, but it will production in the second half of 2014. In NAND, as we said before, we're over 50% 20-nanometer NAND already and well into our 15-nanometer ramp which has gone very well.
James Schneider – Goldman Sachs: I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about understanding you want to keep your options open and keep things flexible regarding the tech transition to NAND. But sitting here looking at today, would you expect that transition to be complete from an output perspective by the end of the calendar first or second quarter?
Mark Durcan: I want to keep a little mystery in that dynamic.
Operator: Our next question in queue will come from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse: Just real quickly, on the ASP guidance for DRAM in the November quarter, curious much of that is being influenced by the addition of Elpida for three months in the quarter, i.e., if you just look at the core Micron and Inotera DRAM ASPs, any sense of how you can tell us how that would have trended Q-on-Q?
Ronald Foster: This is Ron. John, if you look at there are couple of effects, James. One is the --John, excuse me, the flow of market prices, which are up stronger than the average guidance we're giving. But the Elpida product mix has a lower average price than that of historical Micron. As I mentioned in my comments, this pushes down the average ASP in Q1 as you work that into the total mix for a full quarter. Everything else being equal, I would estimate that based on today's pricing that the Elpida mix is taking us down in our average in the high-single digit range. So the guidance we gave you is muted by the fact that the Elpida mix is dropping us down in the high-single digit range on average using quarter-to-date pricing and estimated mix.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse: That’s very helpful, Ron. Then either for Mark Durcan or Mark Adams. Guys, there’s been a lot made about the NAND transition from planar to 3D. I'm wondering if you could help me better understand the Moore's law issues on DRAM, especially as we get below the 20-nanometer node. Seeing a lot of white papers out there about whether or not we've got the right materials, what the cost curve is going to start to look like. So just generically as we think about the shrink capacity in DRAM, how does that look over the next several years?
Mark Durcan: Sorry. Is the question is relative to NAND or DRAM or a little of both?
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse: No, to DRAM specifically. I think investors have vetted the 2D to 3D in NAND. I'm just curious about what's going on in DRAM from a technology perspective? And is there a chance here that the shrink growth slows here as we get below the 20 nanometer node?
Mark Durcan: Absolutely. I think it's inevitable that the pace of technology node migration is going to continue to slow. There's no -- it's interesting because it's not like NAND where there’s really a hard stop on planar NAND. It just becomes very, very difficult with a floating [detail] to make it work at all below about 50 nanometers. But DRAM has a lot of bags in the trick -- a lot of tricks in the bag, sorry. It's just an economic challenge to make that all play out. So I think you're going to continue to see technology migration, but maybe addressing smaller segments where there is some particular form factor need or performance need, as well as just a longer trajectory to get to the next node. But you will see nodes well below 20 nanometers over the next five to seven years.
Operator: Our next question in queue will come from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Vijay Rakesh – Sterne Agee: I'm just wondering, when you look at mobile, I know you gave out your expectations for DRAM, but when you look at mobile DRAM for next year, where do you think mobile DRAM grows? Also, on the NAND side, what's your split between SSD and OEM retail now?
Mark Durcan: Vijay, are you asking that from a Micron perspective or a market perspective?
Vijay Rakesh – Sterne Agee: If you can give me both for mobile DRAM.
Mark Durcan: I’ll give you market. Like Mark, I don't want to -- I want to keep some mystery in exactly what we do with our mix. But basically what you're seeing per handset only, you're looking at an average megabytes per phone of about 450 going to just over 700 in 2014. On the NAND side we're looking at something just below an average of 5 gigabytes of phone going to something just over six and that includes all handsets, an average of all handsets in.
Vijay Rakesh – Sterne Agee: And on the NAND side what's your split between SSD and OEM retail?
Mark Durcan: Again from a market segment standpoint?
Vijay Rakesh – Sterne Agee: Yeah, from Micron standpoint.
Mark Durcan: I would say from a Micron standpoint, we're running around 50% of revenues from SSD and around 30% from consumer and around 10% mobile.
Vijay Rakesh – Sterne Agee: Last question here. I know there’s a lot of focus on free cash flow. When you look at CapEx next year, I know it's coming down. Any thoughts on that? I know you've guided to $2.6 billion to $3.2 billion for fiscal '14, but you expect it to come down a little bit. Where do you think it comes in?
Ronald Foster: After that period, so you are looking at 2015?
Vijay Rakesh – Sterne Agee: Yes.
Ronald Foster: I think we'll hold off on that one for now too.
Operator: Our next question in queue will come from David Wong with Wells Fargo. Your questions please.
David Wong – Wells Fargo: One simple one. R&D, your guidance for the November quarter, $340 million to $350 million. Does this include -- is there some opportunity for rationalization of R&D going forward? Do you have duplication that you plan to eliminate so that the R&D will drop in future quarters?
Ronald Foster: David, it's Ron. Yeah. Obviously, we've just got the acquisition together and we're looking at our go-forward strategies for all of our operating structures and there certainly are opportunities. The general structure of OpEx, both for R&D and SG&A at Elpida was similar to ours as a percent of revenue. So it doesn't radically change the percents of where we are right now. Going forward, obviously we'll be looking at efficiencies and synergies that we can derive across the whole cost structure.
David Wong – Wells Fargo: And just to push a bit further on that CapEx question. I understand you don't want to give guidance for the out year. But within that $2.6 billion to $3.2 billion, are there any special charges that you're taking or special costs that you’re incurring to integrate all your facilities? And can you quantify those for us that are one-term lead type things?
Ronald Foster: No. There’s really not. It's really just the technology migration across the entire network.
Kipp Bedard: Unfortunately we only have time for about one more question.
Operator: Our next question in queue will come from the line of Daniel Amir with Lazard. Please go ahead, your questions please.
Daniel Amir – Lazard Capital Markets: So just a quick question. Just in terms of DRAM mix, what's the consideration here in terms of changing the DRAM mix here over time now that you have Elpida. In terms of looking at increasing the networking or server DRAM versus mobile and PC, what's the considerations here? Thanks.
Mark Durcan: Some of that, Daniel is really qualifying and getting those products into these applications and internally qualifications as well as getting them qualified at the customer level. But the opportunity we believe is significant. We're obviously not going to quantify it here on this call, but you've heard reference today to historical revenue from Elpida around wafer sales and personal computing and mobile. They obviously haven't in the past been very successful in getting over there to these specialty markets. And quite frankly, our customers you can see we had records in basically all of our specialty markets and we feel like we were constrained. There was more upside there. So we think the opportunity is there. Our job is to go make that happen.
Ronald Foster: At the highest level, we're not seeking any market share segments in any particular segment. We’re seeking to optimize our margins across the segments and drive differentiated products that have enduring values.
Kipp Bedard: With that, we would like to thank everyone for participating on the call today. If you will please bear with me, I need to repeat the Safe Harbor protection language.

Mark? 
D. Mark Durcan:  Thanks, Kipp. I’d like to start today with an overview of the key developments during the quarter and a few strategic and industry updates, then I’ll turn it over to Ron for a financial summary and before turning to Q&A, we’ll close with Mark Adams covering more details of our business units and operations performance and market conditions.
 : In NAND, we had another quarter of strong unit growth in the SSD segment and took advantage of improved market ASPs generally. We remain focused on making capital and segmentation decisions to optimize margin and free cash flow over time. As you have noticed in the release, revenue in the quarter was up about 12% with strong growth in both DRAM and NAND. Gross margins were also up significantly from 18% to 24% highlighted by DRAM, which was up over 16 percentage points for the quarter. Trade NAND margins improved by about five percentage points and still represent our highest margin product category followed by DRAMs and NOR.
 : We believe the customer demand and margin opportunity in NAND over the next 12 months coupled with a highly attenuated capital investment relative to Greenfield capacity make this a sound financial decision. A measured transition will likely occur over the course of the next year or so depending on market conditions as we continue to monitor the demand and margin profile of our various products and segments. The impact of this conversion will be included in the guidance we provide. During the quarter, we closed on the previously announced sale of our 200 millimeter image sensor fab in Avezzano, and took another step to streamline our operations through restructuring our R&D relationship with STMicro in Agrate, Italy and also discontinued operations of our LED pilot line in Boise. We will continue to look for opportunities to improve our operational structure and performance including the wind down of some remaining 200 millimeter capacity as we migrate more products to 300 millimeter. We made good progress towards closing the acquisition of Elpida and believe the principal hurdles to closing are mostly resolved. We’ve obtained regulatory clearances, bondholder challenges of a planned reorganization in Japan have been denied, and the waiting period for challenges for the recognition motion in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court has expired. As a result, we are optimistic the closing will occur during our fiscal Q4. Elpida financial performance has been strong in recent periods and continues to improve reflecting a strengthening DRAM market, as well as Elpida strong mobile DRAM presence and operational improvements. During last quarter, Micron and Elpida entered into a joint development agreement that has enabled more seamless integration of our technology roadmaps, and we are encouraged by the early productivity of the cooperation. Following the close, our overall trade memory wafer capacity will increase by about 45% from today’s level without impacting industry supply. This deal will provide significant revenue and margin leverage for Micron as we are positioned to benefit from low-cost scale, enhanced product and customer breadth, and improved operational efficiency. We believe conditions remain positive to continue the improvement in the memory industry. We’re forecasting DRAM industry supply up in the mid 20% range this year and lows to mid 20s in calendar 2014. For NAND, we are forecasting supply up in the mid 30% range this year followed by the low 40s in 2014. We believe this historically slow supply growth coupled with memory demand growth in mobile and infrastructure related markets such as smartphones, storage, and servers, creates a favorable balance. We’re well positioned to capitalize and look forward to driving possible growth in coming quarters. I’ll stop here and turn it over to Ron and Mark before returning for Q&A.
Ronald C. Foster: Thanks, Mark. Our third quarter of fiscal 2013 ended on May 30. Our website has a schedule containing certain key results for the third quarter, as well as guidance for the fourth quarter. That information is also presented on the following slides. For the third quarter, we reported net income of $43 million or $0.04 per diluted share on net sales of $2.3 billion. These results compared to the previous quarter’s net loss of $286 million or $0.28 per diluted share on net sales of $2.1 billion. The consolidated revenue growth and improved operating results reflect the significant improvement in the memory markets, particularly for DRAM products. The effect of this improvement can also be seen on the equity and net income of equity method investments line shown on the slide, which largely reflects our share of the net loss from Inotera with a two-month lag. In their two most recent monthly reports, Inotera has reported positive net income, which will be reflected in the next quarter’s results for Micron. Related to Mark’s earlier comments on our continuing efforts to optimize our operational footprint, these actions have resulted in restructuring charges. This quarter we separately presented those charges as a restructure and asset impairment expense on the face of the income statement. Expenses and asset impairment charges associated with restructure activities from prior quarters have been reclassified to present the operating results on a consistent basis. In addition, to simplify the presentation of noteworthy items and those items that are not representative of the company’s trended economic performance, we are presenting a schedule of net income for the period as reported, reconciled to net income excluding these certain items. Note that the amounts in the reconciliation do not include all the related income tax effect as the amounts are generally de minimis due to our net operating loss carry forwards and our global tax structure. The restructure activities over the past two quarters include the following: Approximately [$60] [ph] million charge that we accrued in the second quarter associated with the estimated loss on the sale of our 200 millimeter imaging fabrication facility in Avezzano, Italy to LFoundry. This transaction closed in the third quarter. For the first three quarters of the fiscal year, the Imaging business reported approximately $60 million of operating loss in our Micron results on sales of approximately $220 million in addition to the restructure charge. Going forward there will be no future revenue or losses from sales of imaging products. Approximately $26 million in the third quarter for the loss on the transfer of certain assets and approximately 500 employees in Agrate, Italy to STMicroelectronics is also included in the schedule. And approximately $25 million in the third quarter to write down certain production assets used in the LED technology development, which was terminated in the third quarter. Other recurring items presented in the reconciliation include the amortization of debt discount and other costs. This adjustment which flows into interest expense on our financial statement is substantially comprised of the imputed interest to value the debt component of our convertible notes at fair value. This item will be on-going as long as we have these convertible notes and discounted debt such as the Elpida installment payments. Foreign currency activity including the impact from our hedging programs is also included. The largest impact in this area is from the hedge of the Elpida Rexchip acquisition, which has been heavily impacted by volatility in the yen exchange rate. Other items called out in the second quarter include a non-cash loss of $31 million from the early redemption of a portion of our outstanding 2014 convertible notes, and two favorable items in the tax provision resulting from the resolution of an uncertainty and a tax rate change both occurring outside the U.S. So, adjusting for these items, non-GAAP EPS improved from $0.06 loss in our GAAP results in the second quarter to an income of $0.15 per share in the third quarter. As we have mentioned previously, we may undertake additional restructure activities as we continue to optimize our manufacturing and other operations. Let’s turn now to operating results and outlook. Note that none of the guidance we are providing today includes any direct effects from the Elpida/Rexchip acquisition. DRAM revenue in the third quarter increased 23% compared to the previous quarter, as a result of a 16% increase in bit average selling prices and a 6% increase in bit sales. The increased selling prices for DRAM products was favorably affected by more Inotera volume sold into higher value segments along with general improvements in the market. DRAM bit costs decreased 5% quarter-to-quarter driven primarily by the higher concentration of lower cost products from Inotera. The cost of DRAM products purchased from Inotera increased in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, but was still slightly lower than the cost of the rest of the Company’s DRAM production on a per bit basis. So guidance for Q4 DRAM is as follows; using quarter-to-date selling prices and projected product mix for the quarter, ASPs would be up mid-to-high single-digits compared to the Q3 average. Projected bit costs are expected to be flat relative to Q3, projected production volume is up high single-digits. Key themes influencing this guidance for DRAM are, first four-gig DDR3 volume continues to ramp in our system, comprising over one half of the DRAM bit sales in the third quarter and increasing into the fourth quarter. This transition from two gigabit to four gigabit has – have the effect of lowering ASPs and costs with some margin improvement. We’re seeing the somewhat higher percentage of our total bit production from Inotera with improving product mix and costs have moved directionally with prices. As a reminder, the cost of products purchased from Inotera is based on a moving average market minus model with a one-month lag, while we account for the change in our equity investment with a two-month lag. The higher output in the fourth quarter is a result of higher output from Inotera partially offset by lower output from our Singapore DRAM fab as we transition existing DRAM capacity there to NAND. This transition will continue through the next year or so based also on market conditions. Turning now to Trade NAND, bit sales in the third quarter increased 8% compared to the prior quarter, primarily as a result of a higher per bit average selling prices. We continue to see growth in SSD sales, and we built some bit inventory to support strong demand over the coming quarters. Trade NAND bit costs in the third quarter were relatively flat compared to the second quarter due to a higher SSD production, and some costs related to the start of NAND production in the Singapore DRAM fab. So guidance for Q4 Trade NAND is as follows. Using quarter-to-date selling prices, and the projected mix for the quarter, Trade NAND ASPs would be down mid single-digits. Bit costs are expected to be down high single-digits, while bit production is expected to be up high single-digits. Key trends affecting for Q4 guidance are, we expect a higher density product mix in NAND, lowering both the ASP and cost per gigabyte while increasing volumes. We’d expect also to sell more NAND and SSDs with greater capacity per drive, which slightly lower to the average ASP and cost per gigabyte. We continue the migration to 20-nanometer process technology, resulting in lower costs and increasing bit output into both component discrete sales and SSDs. NOR sales were relatively flat comparing the third quarter to the second quarter in line with our prior guidance. NOR revenue, which has been fairly stable over the past few quarters is expected to decrease by about a third in the fourth quarter as the wireless business accelerates its transition to more NAND-based solutions. With positive net income, certain stock options and convertible note start to become dilutive in our financials. These diluted items added approximately 23 million shares to the denominator in the EPS calculation for the quarter. Going forward because of the dilutive effect of the convertible notes and employee stock options has determined using the treasury stock method, the amount of dilution will vary primarily based on the average traded share price for the period. For example, the average traded share price for the third quarter was approximately $9.85, which resulted in 23 million shares being added to the denominator of our diluted shares. Has the share price been $14 average for this last quarter, approximately 105 million shares would have been added to the denominator. SG&A expense in third quarter was just below our guided range. We expect SG&A expense in the fourth quarter to be between $135 million to $145 million. R&D expense was $226 million in the third quarter and is expected to be between $230 million and $240 million in the fourth quarter. There was no DRAM development costs sharing with Nanya in the third quarter as the joint development program with Nanya was discontinued earlier in the year. The level of R&D expense in any given quarter can vary based on the timing of product qualifications in the volume of development wafers processed. The company generated $624 million in cash flow from operating activities in the third quarter as Mark mentioned reflecting improvement in the operating results compared to the prior quarter, the third quarter ended with cash and investments, including non-current investments of just over $2.9 billion. As Mark summarized, expenses for property, plant and equipment in the third quarter was $235 million and we expect expenditures for the fourth quarter to be between $300 million and $500 million, which will result in fiscal 2013 total spending below the low end of our guided range for the year. We are deferring some capital spending in the second half of our fiscal year as we anticipate changes from the Elpida transaction. We expect to pick up this spending in 2014 as we integrate the two companies. As previously indicated, we expect the capital intensity of the combined company to be similar to Micron’s stand-alone historical level on a per wafer basis. Cash flow from investing activities in the third quarter includes the cash payments on currency hedges of approximately $200 million, which includes settlement of the previous hedges associated with the Elpida Rexchip acquisition. Similar to the discussion in our conference call last quarter, at an exchange rate of 95 yen per U.S. dollar, U.S. dollar equivalent price for the Elpida acquisition including the installment payments to creditors would be approximately $400 million lower relative to the price when we signed sponsor agreement last summer. In addition, at the expiration of the initial hedges earlier in the third quarter, we entered into a series of new hedging transactions to mitigate the effect of currency rate changes on 80 billion yen. This 80 billion yen is the initial payment of 60 billion yen due at closing plus the first 20 billion yen installment payment to the creditors in the reorganization process due in December 2014. The total hedging cost for this structure is capped at approximately $30 million of which approximately $24 million was accrued in the third quarter. Post closing, we currently plan to implement a natural hedging strategy to offset the foreign exchange exposure on the longer dated installment debt by utilizing yen denominated assets such as cash. In May of this year, Nanya made an additional investment in Inotera, which reduced our ownership from approximately 40% to approximately 35%, because the price of the share sold in Nanya was above our carrying value per share. Micron will recognize a non-operating, non-cash gain of approximately $49 million as a result of the transaction. With the two-month lag in equity accounting for Inotera, this gain will be recognized in operating results in our fourth quarter. And with that, I will turn over to Mark Adams for his comments.
Mark W. Adams: Thanks, Ron. I’m going to provide some more detail on our third quarter operating performance, as well as share some comments about the current state of the memory market. Our NAND Solutions Group recorded revenue of $730 million, up 2% when compared to our second quarter. Total Trade NAND gross margins were up 5 percentage points quarter-over-quarter, reflecting improved ASPs and stronger penetration into enterprise SSDs. Our branded SSD business was $178 million in Q3 and 11% quarter-over-quarter increase. When you combine sales of our Micron branded SSD drives with flash memory we [shift] to our third-party SSD customers, shipments to the SSD segment represented over 60% of our Trade NAND capacity. We continued to migrate the SSD product family to our 20-nanometer flash memory technology with the announcement of our M500 fairly charged at client and web 2.0 applications. In addition, we launched the industry’s first MLC based PCIe accelerated drives with the Micron P43 for 20M initially targeted at data base applications. We did cross over our 20-nanometer process technology. 20-nanometer production will continue to expand over the next couple of quarters. We plan to commence the ramp of our 16-nanometer technology early in calendar year 2014 and anticipate a faster ramp that occurred at the 20-nanometer node given solid SSD and other socket enablement. In addition, we are pleased with our progress on 3D NAND development and remain focused on driving support for higher end storage applications. From a pricing perspective, as we shift our SSD portfolio from SLC to higher density MLC, we will see a lower ASP per gigabyte due to density growth per unit and lower cost associated with the technology. The effect is a slight downward movement on ASPs offset by improved cost with a net positive benefit to our gross margins. Due to this mix effect, our quarter-to-date mix adjusted trade NAND ASPs are forfeited down mid single digits based on quarter-to-date pricing with expected continued improvement in margins. In short, we remain optimistic for a strong second half of the calendar 2013 for Flash memory. Sales for our DRAM Solutions Group came in at $924 million, up 23% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in sales were driven by 16% increase in overall DRAM pricing coupled with a 6% increase in DRAM shipments when compared to Q2. Our overall, DRAM gross margins came in just above the 24% corporate average, up over 16% from our second quarter. We achieved outstanding results in all of our premium DRAM segments with non-PC business representing about half of our gigabit shipments. Our server business recorded record shipments with the total sales of over 260 million gigabit equivalents driven by increased SSDs at key OEMs and cloud service providers. We had a record quarter in our networking business for both revenue and bit shipments. DRAM bit shipments in networking were up 19% compared to our second quarter and now represents 16% of our DRAM revenue. We had another strong quarter and made progress to expand beyond the large OEM business to smaller customers and distributors in the sale of our networking portfolio. Sales of our networking products through distribution are up a 139% year-over-year. We also had a strong quarter in our Consumer Graphics segment, which continues to be an attractive premium market and bit in particular looking forward with the upcoming launch of next-generation gaming consoles. DDR3 volume represented 75% of our overall DRAM production as DDR2 is addressing more of the legacy market requirement. We are optimistic we will begin shipment of our 25-nanometer DDR3 technology in early fiscal year 2014 and start sampling our 20-nanometer DDR3 product by the end of calendar year 2013. We’re getting positive market feedback from Micron's DDR4 samples at our key OEM customers. Overall, DRAM continue to be a – to gain momentum and we had strong design in activity with the neighbors and OEMs for Hybrid Memory Cube. From a market standpoint, U.S. carrier CapEx for LTE deployment is strong and data center networking remains a bright spot for investment by key OEMs. DRAM pricing continued to be favorable. We are seeing good progress in narrowing the gap between spot market sales and our OEM customers to negotiate contract pricing. As we mentioned on our last call, the PC segment is a lower percentage of our DRAM business at about 40% of revenue. Our specialty business typically lags in market in terms of price movement in either direction and that’s had a limiting effect on our combined DRAM pricing. As such the current spot market price increase in pricing while still positive has less of an impact on our overall DRAM ASPs. Channel inventory stayed tight throughout the quarter, which earlier are on allocation on a number of DRAM products and not seeing any signs of a let down in demand at the end of the summer month. The DRAM supply and demand remains favorable balance and we think the situation will remain for the second half of calendar year 2013. Sales by the Wireless Solutions Group were up roughly 30% quarter-over-quarter as we saw increased demand in both our major OEM customers and the Tier II China mobile market. Supply for mobile DRAM and NAND products remain tight due to strong demand for tablets and smartphones. Our Low Power DDR3 16 gigabit product is in the design phase at the top smartphone manufacturers. Our NAND based MCPs have gained strong traction in the overall market with growing share in the China smartphone market. Our portfolio of e-MMC and EMCP products is expanding with strong presence across all of our customer base. From a market perspective, we saw improved pricing trend in the Tier II China market and then expanding to our larger OEM customers.
 : Our Embedded Solutions Group had another record revenue quarter eclipsing the $300 million mark. The embedded business maintain strong gross margins in Q3. We continue to invest and growing our presence within this category. ESG’s automotive segment increased market share highlighted by our automotive eMMC product portfolio and setting our record shipment to automotive in the quarter. We are seeing a rapid transition from NOR to low density NAND in the embedded market. In fact, our embedded NAND business roughly doubled quarter-over-quarter from Q2 to Q3. Despite this we keep targeting our NOR margins, and are on track for qualification of our 300 millimeter, 45 nanometer NOR technology in early calendar 2014. Overall, demand for ESG product is increasing, and we are optimistic for a strong Q4. Our Q4 results reflect the improving memory market, and good execution in key operating areas. We continue to manage our expense lines as reflected by our SG&A and R&D staying in alignment with last quarter spending, and our guidance for Q3. We continue to drive inventory term performance down that’d be flattish by higher cost of goods in the quarter. We successfully concluded the sale of our Avezzano imaging fab and are continuing explore ways to optimize our manufacturing footprint to allow the future capacity needs. Despite the current marketing conditions improving, we have managed also to reduce our overall headcount by 7% compared to second quarter. As we look to invest in high-value differentiated memory solutions, we also remain committed to driving maximum efficiency in our operations. Our management team has been working diligently on integration plans with Elpida. The teams have worked well together, and we are excited about the opportunity for the consolidated business going forward. After the close of our Elpida transaction, we will have increased our trade memory capacity over 90% compared to early last year, all with existing industry capacity. Our customers are supportive and encouraged about the prospects of the scale of Micron with Elpida, and are seeking a new level of strategic alignment for advanced memory solutions. Micron’s customers understand memory is evolving to new applications and form factors moving to a more solutions orientation. We are measured in our approach to capital spending as we transition technology nodes over the next 12 to 18 months. The market for both DRAM and NAND remains in good balance and we are optimistic for a strong Q4. With that, I will hand it back over to Kipp.
Kipp A. Bedard: Thanks, Mark. We will now take questions from callers. (Operator Instructions) With that, please open up the phone lines.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Glen Yeung from Citi.
Glen S. P. Yeung – Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Just a question about the opportunities, the demand opportunities from gaming, we’ve seen those game consoles go from quite a low amount of DRAMs to quite a high number now. To what extent do you think this is a meaningful demand driver for DRAM in the next few quarters?
Mark W. Adams:  I think, it’s – Glen, this is Mark Adams. I think it’s all pretty positive for us. When we look at the gaming sector and compare it to other segments, it’s still a pretty positive segment for us. Looking at densities kind of on average about 8 gigabytes, it’s all pretty favorable and of course, going to the holiday season, we’re pretty excited.
Glen S. P. Yeung – Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Can I ask another question about cost then, just thinking about Inotera, I recognize Inotera costs are below yours and over time it’s a bit of drag on the net cost down at the companies. But is there a point at which the cost come together and at that point, do we then kind of revert back to more normal cost declines in DRAM?
D. Mark Durcan: Glen, this is Mark Durcan. You know it’s not likely to happen in the short-term and that’s primary because there is a pretty significant difference in the mix that runs in Inotera today versus the mix that runs in other places. So you look at Micron DRAM today, there’s a lot of networking, server, consumer, gaming, products that aren’t necessarily found in Inotera that typically drive pretty good ASPs, but also maybe, not advancing to the leading edge node as quickly. So we’re not particularly concerned that the cost profiles don’t marry up. the other thing to keep in mind obviously is that going forward Inotera cost to Micron are going to track with the end markets and those are going to move over time. As we bring Elpida into the fold, we will have a wholly owned DRAM capacity that will be much more leading edge and cost efficient to service some of those more high volume markets.
Glen S. P. Yeung – Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Perfect. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.
Joe Moore – Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you. You said that nano is the most profitable category. but it doesn’t look that far apart if you look at DSG being a little higher than NSG, and I know that doesn’t map exactly to the chips. But they’re pretty close and now you’ve got DRAM prices going up and NAND going down. So going forward, how do you think about the relative profitability of the two and how do you think about moving capacity over to NAND. Is it possible that DRAM will be more profitable?
Mark W. Adams: So I think the clarification I’d like to make is that the pricing trend you identified in NAND, I should clarify is really driven by a shift and a mix from SLC and MLC and some other applications. Now, we think as gross margin positive and we think the relative profitability is about the same.
D. Mark Durcan: And let me jump in here, we’re not going to be moving capacity around on a high frequency basis. the changes we’re making are over the long haul and if we look at the market going forward for NAND, there is just insatiable demand. It looks like there’s pretty strong demand growth out there into the future and that’s why we’re making the adjustments.
Joe Moore – Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great, thank you. And then at the beginning of the quarter, you had talked about NAND bits being up sequentially and they ended up flat and pricing being down and ended up quite a bit higher, what was the change over the course of the quarter, (inaudible)?
Mark W. Adams: Sure. Ron had mentioned in his comments that the nature of the SSD business will provide some variance in terms of inventory levels and how we stage products for our strategic customers around SSDs. And when you get to a category that as I mentioned in my comments are up around 60% of our trade NAND capacity that will have a effect on the timing of the shipments.
Joe Moore – Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from James Schneider from Goldman Sachs
James Schneider – Goldman Sachs: Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk about the DRAM capacity situation for a second. Many of your competitors have talked about transitioning from PC DRAM to mobile, I was wondering if you still see that continuing in the industry at large for the foreseeable future or if you see that reaching equilibrium at some point soon?
Mark W. Adams: Well, we still are pretty positive on that trend, James, this is Mark Adams again. We still are pretty positive and watching it, but at this point, we don’t see a shift away from that trend.
James Schneider – Goldman Sachs: Okay, fair enough. And then just as a follow-up then on the NAND side in terms of capacity, there has been quite a bit of controversy about how much capacity is going to get added this year on the NAND side? Can you maybe give us your feeling about roughly your estimate of how many wafer starts get added to NAND by the end of 2013?
Mark W. Adams:
 :
James Schneider – Goldman Sachs: Yeah, that’s very helpful. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh from Sterne Agee.
Vijay Rakesh – Sterne Agee: Yeah, hi, guys. On your gross margin, it looks like it came up pretty nicely on the quarter. Just looking out given the improving profitability on DRAM and NAND and historically you guys have hit 30% back in the 2010 timeframe, how do you see that going out?
Mark W. Adams: Hey, Vijay, as you know from following us for a long time, we just stay away steadfastly from trying to predict gross margins. We’re going to let you guys do that. Would you like to ask a follow-up question or should we move on?
Vijay Rakesh – Sterne Agee: On Inotera, I was wondering, it looks like you guys – that that’s a big profitability in the last two months, how do you see that contribution going forward?
Ronald C. Foster:  Vijay, this is Ron. If you look at the Inotera structure, as I mentioned in my comments, we are on an ASP minus arrangement structure and it’s a moving average formula. So as Mark already commented, there will be a tendency for the cost to move with the market pricing, what it gives us is a stability of a major segment of our DRAM capacity with pretty good margin structure. But you’re going to see the cost move with the price moves in the market, ASP moves in the market in general.
Vijay Rakesh – Sterne Agee: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Newman from Sanford Bernstein.
Mark Newman – Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Hi. Thanks a lot. So, could you give a brief update on the technology side, you mentioned, 3D NAND progress is pretty good, if you got any further update on that. And I’d like to understand a little bit more about on the NAND side, what you’re doing in terms of – what do you have in terms of controller and system expertise and you mentioned, there is a quite a few of your – you’re selling, your SSD sales were up quite a bit, I think you said, 11% increase to $178 million. I’d like to get a sense of your controller expertise and how that’s helping you and how you’re kind of working on that to improve it? Thanks.
D. Mark Durcan: Okay. So this is Mark Durcan, let me jump in on the technology question first and I’ll let Mark address the controller firmware software capability piece of that question. So from a non-volatile advanced memory perspective, we feel like we’re very, very well-positioned relative to those we compete against, not only in the NAND arena, but also in some of the emerging memory spaces. So let me address NAND first. Mark commented earlier on the call, on the 16-nanometer roll out, there has been a lot of different terminologies out there about 2X, 2Y, 1X, 1Y, I don’t know how that maps to somebody else’s nomenclature. But I don’t think there’s anybody else out there with 16-nanometer [half edge] [ph] product, and I’m pretty confident that that’s going to be the smallest cell size planar NAND in the marketplace here over the next couple of quarters. So feel pretty good about how we’re positioned on planar NAND. Moving to 3D NAND, we’re very happy with the progress we are making on our 3D NAND programs. we believe every one is taking a slightly different approach and obviously, we like our approach the best. but we don’t have complete visibility in what everyone else is doing. I would say that you’re going to see samples in the marketplace from a number of different competitors over the next few quarters. But you’re not going to see any significant production occurring until the second half of 2014, you really won’t see anything that has any impact on the marketplace probably until the 2015 timeframe. I’m not saying that, because I think I’m behind anybody else, I’m just trying to give you a sense of what the impact on the marketplace might be. Relative to some of the other emerging technologies that are out there, whether there are storage-class memories or pure NAND replacements et cetera, we’ve got a number of different programs going with a number of different partners, as well as some purely internal ones and we really like the way we positioned our company in terms of being able to work on anything that we think is fruitful and do it in a cost effective a way as possible with the partnerships we’ve created. So if you’re thinking about who is going to be positioned for any memory technology transitions that are coming down the pipe, we feel very good about how we’ve positioned the company. Mark, do you want to talk about controls?
Mark W. Adams: Sure. I think I’ve mentioned in the past couple of calls, our strategy on controller development around SSDs and around NAND solutions in general has kind of philosophically been, we’re going to partner externally for entry level client type devices, consumer devices, and for some of the higher value add differentiated products, we’re going to invest in our own controller development and that’s pretty much played out at least to-date. For example, I referenced a PCIe Accelerator drive earlier in my comments, and that’s a controller that Micron developed in-house at their own controller scheme as well as firmware organization. Over the long run, I think you’ll see us add to those efforts and themes as we see more opportunities for differentiated solutions on the high end of the storage market. In addition to that, we see pretty good value, and doing so more on firmware and on eMMC solution for both the embedded and mobile market, but again, the way to think about it is kind of your differentiated higher end value add solutions. We’re going to try to do in-house with our controller and firmware teams, and on the entry level solutions, to be more along the lines of the third-party partnerships, maybe with their control in our firmware or totally outsourced.
Mark Newman – Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Okay, thank you so much. That’s very helpful.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.
John W. Pitzer – Credit Suisse Securities LLC: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. I apologize if I missed it. You guys talked about the industry supply growth expected over the next 12 months, and your ability to outgrow that given the Elpida acquisition?
Mark W. Adams: Sure, John. We’re looking at DRAM in the low-to-mid 20 range for this year, and then low 20 range for 2014. As you pointed out with the Elpida acquisition, we’ll probably be above that. On the NAND side, we’re looking at mid 30s for this year, and probably low 40s for next year. Again, we’ll probably be slightly ahead depending on the pace at which Mark decides to move the Tech fab.
John W. Pitzer – Credit Suisse Securities LLC: And then maybe a question for Mark Durcan, Mark, just given that, when you look at the DRAM side of the equation, for the first time and perhaps over a decade, we seem to have some pretty good demand drivers out there whether it’s the gaming console on the back half of the year with the fact as you move to multicore chips in handsets, you are just seeing DRAM density go up. At what point would it make sense to actually grow that DRAM asset base more quickly just given how strong the demand signals are and what would you need to see to really take a meaningful step up in your capital spending plans?
D. Mark Durcan: Well, as we look at those kind of decisions, it’s a multi-year investment payback decision, right. So we have to be sure, but we don’t see any significant oversupply being created as a result of that activity in a horizon of which we’re going to recoup the capital expenditure. So we’re going to be pretty careful about having additional DRAM capacity as opposed to optimizing the existing capacity we have.
 :
John W. Pitzer – Credit Suisse Securities LLC: And then, Mark, maybe I’d just sneak one in just on that balance sheet, given that the model is now generating significant free cash flow and you’re starting to see some dilution from the converts, I’m just kind of curious is how we should think about fixing the balance sheet over what timeframe, what kind of looks interesting and is there anything you can do to help keep the share count down?
D. Mark Durcan: Well, yeah, let me (inaudible) and then maybe Ron has got a few additional comments. Obviously, we’ve done a little bit of convert repurchase here over the last few quarters and we’ll have more appetite to do that, obviously, as we deleverage the balance sheet and have available factors to do, but we have to trade that off against the other options of how we return value to the shareholders, but that’s something we’ll be looking at. Ron?
Ronald C. Foster: Sure. On the share count side, John, we’ve got, in terms of our convertible debt instruments, we have actually targeted those to be lightest possible on the equity, lot of them created to be pretty debt light, but yet still leverage the volatility of our stock in the pricing of the instrument. So we are using the treasury stock method on all of our dilution calculations and basically that slows the rate of dilution and that’s why I gave you an example of how it will actually work as you flow that through the divisor on the EPS calculation. And going forward, obviously, we have – we’ve been careful and continue to be careful about equity position, but the dilution effects will play through the stock prices, but maybe I just give you a quick formula, so you get an idea of how it works and we can certainly give you more information offline if you want. If you take the average share price of the stock in the period we’re reporting and subtract out the strike price on the instrument and our strike prices tend to be in the eight, nine kind of range on pricing on the stock, so you take that average price minus the strike price divided by the average market price, so you get a percentage, multiply times your share count on that instrument, that gives you the dilution effect. So it’s a muted dilution effect unless you get, really get high up in the stock price, and that’s how that works and why we constructed them that way. In addition, we also have exercised Capped Calls on virtually every one of our instruments and we’ve got several $100 million for example at a $14 strike price that will come in as the benefit of Capped Calls raising that strike price up. As an economic benefit, but obviously it could accrue to us in cash and we could repurchase shares or whatever. Mathematically, we get the economic benefit and we decide what we want to do with it. So we’ve done Capped Calls as well as that treasury stock method to make it minimized.
John W. Pitzer – Credit Suisse Securities LLC:  Helpful, Ron. Thank you.
Ronald C. Foster: Yes. 
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Monika Garg from Pacific Crest Securities.
Monika Garg – Pacific Crest Securities LLC: Hi, thanks for taking my question. The first question is, I am trying to understand I am comparing the NAND cost declines in 2012 quarterly over 2013, so in 2012, you had a very nice NAND cost declines, and Q1 2012 was minus 16, then minus 18 in Q2, minus 29 in Q3, but if I compare that with 2013, Q1 cost was up 2%, the second quarter was minus 5% and third quarter is again plus 1%. So we understand that the benefit of shrinks is declining, but just trying to understand what else could be the reason?
Mark W. Adams: Yeah, Monika, a big variable in all this obviously is mix. There is lots of flavors in NAND, there’s SLC NAND, MLC NAND, TLC NAND and that depends on that kind of slung a couple of times as we’d moved through different technology node generations and different applications of the NAND is going into. So if you go back in the timeframe you’re alluding to, there was a fairly significant swing in the MLC and even at Micron from some relatively small amount of TLC, which drives a significant bit cost reduction. As we move through more recent quarters, we’ve actually seen slowdown in some of the technology transitions driven by more highly reliable and non-changing biz going into high reliability SSDs as well as the 20-nanometer conversion that I alluded to, earlier Mark alluded to, actually driving potentially higher RAM cost initially as that wind in and then go on little bit slower at the 20-nanometer node than it did at the 34-nanometer node. So a lot of different things to play into that. But generally speaking, we feel like we’re doing what we need to do in the NAND business.
John W. Pitzer – Credit Suisse Securities LLC:  And then the last question is on the mobile DRAM size. So we’ve seen PC DRAM pricing significantly up quarter-over-quarter. Could you talk about the trends in the mobile DRAM pricing, especially given the some publically available data shows that in Q2, mobile DRAM pricing was actually down quarter-over-quarter?
D. Mark Durcan: Yeah. I’ll let Mark address the specifics of more recent moves in the marketplace. But what I would say relative to PC and mobile DRAM pricing dynamic is that, obviously, there is a pretty significant price advantage for mobile DRAM earlier in the year, and as more bits have converted from PC DRAM for mobile DRAM to meet that rapidly growing demand, we’ve seen PC DRAM start to catch up. Eventually, these things are likely if the market position for us to equilibrate at an ASP that’s about different – about equivalent to the difference in cost sort of gross margins are neutralized between the two. And that’s probably where it’ll oscillate around here over the next couple of quarters as demand and supply, the people consuming the bits and people producing the bits, work out that equilibrium. And also say that’s a – that’s sort of a process we went through on the NAND, the discussion we just had as we think about SLC, MLC, TLC, 20-nanometer, 34-nanometer, what we are doing is, we’re optimizing gross margin, and whether it’s mobile to PC DRAM or MLC to SLC to 20-nanometer or 34-nanometer or 25-nanometer, we’re just optimizing gross margin based on customer demand.
John W. Pitzer – Credit Suisse Securities LLC: Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Hans Mosesmann from Raymond James.
Brian C. Peterson – Raymond James & Associates, Inc.:  Hi, this is Brian Peterson in for Hans. Just a quick question on the NAND side, you indicated that gross margins were up 5 points sequentially, but looking at the operating margins, they were actually down. And I know the consolidated OpEx numbers were in line, it’s a little bit lower than you’re expecting. So could you just give some color on the disconnect there?
D. Mark Durcan: Yeah, I think the differences that NAND goes into a number of different business units at Micron. So the numbers you’re referring to are NSG numbers, but obviously there is NAND that goes into ESG that in many cases it carries a pretty significant premium. There is also NAND going into mobile products and MCPs and sometimes it’s tough to even figure out exactly what the gross margin is in those products that can be either higher or lower. So it’s a PU effect versus a NAND technology effect.
Brian C. Peterson – Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Just lastly, on the supply side for NAND, I thought that the previous forecast was kind of in the mid 30s, and it looks like you’re talking about low 40s now, so, just to clarify, is that a little bit of an increase and what’s driving out there?
D. Mark Durcan: Actually, I gave you both years, for 2013, we now think it’s a little bit lower than our last calls. We’re now in the mid 30s with the rest of the market and it’s for 2014, we’re looking at low 40s.
Brian C. Peterson – Raymond James & Associates, Inc.:  Okay. Thank you.
D. Mark Durcan: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Freedman from RBC Capital Markets.
Doug Freedman – RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks for taking my question, guys. If you could talk a little bit about, you just mentioned you’re looking at moving DRAM to NAND and what can we expect that to have an impact on your bit output growth and in which quarter should we expect that?
Mark W. Adams:  It’s all included, Doug, in the guides that we give you and we – if you go back to the last quarter conference call, we did mention we were starting to prep the fab, so we’d have an impact of lowering our DRAM bit growth in Q3, but it’s in our guide as we give it to you.
Doug Freedman – RBC Capital Markets LLC: So the transition will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter that you’ve just guided?
Mark W. Adams: No, not at all, yeah, over probably the next four quarters or so with adjustments from market.
Doug Freedman – RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. I guess, what I’m trying to get at is the transition I imagine it has some sort of a negative impact on your total potential production output. What type of a handicap are you operating under as you migrate DRAM to NAND?
Mark W. Adams: It’s – that piece is pretty transitional and you’ve seen some of the impact as Ron alluded to earlier on, had an impact on both probably DRAM and NAND costs in the quarter we just finished and that will probably continue for another quarter and then we withdrew the overall manufacturing input back, but the actual transition will occur in the over four quarter period (inaudible).
Doug Freedman – RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay.
Mark W. Adams: So the reason there, Doug, is you got to create some wide space to get the tools in and then once you reach sort of an equilibrium, you’re not suffering anymore downside.
Doug Freedman – RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. In the past, we did get some filing when you did some of your debt restructuring with some numbers around Elpida, can you give us some update on their financial performance?
Ronald C. Foster: Doug, this is Ron. Mark already made a comment in his script about the Elpida, the strength of performance in moving in line with the DRAM business, we don’t have information at this time that’s available to update beyond what he already said.
Doug Freedman – RBC Capital Markets LLC: All right. If I could then just follow-up on the inventory, you made a comment that your NAND inventory dip was up in the SSD segment, but yet your overall inventory at the company was only up $11 million. Does that mean that DRAM was actually down to offset the NAND that you built?
D. Mark Durcan: The comments I made was just around some SSD and the web pipeline. And, obviously, there’s a whole lot of moving parts in the broad mix of our portfolio. So I wouldn’t draw that conclusion between DRAM and NAND; just moving parts in total. We are continuing to manage cycle times in our inventory and trying to improve all of those activities quarter-by-quarter, so some of that effect helps us as well.
Doug Freedman – RBC Capital Markets LLC: And I guess, I’ll leave you alone after one last one, if you could, what are you seeing the inventory in the marketplace given the fact that pricing has been rising in both NAND and DRAM? Can you give us an update on what you’re seeing in the marketplace inventories? Thank you.
Mark W. Adams: Yeah, sure, Doug, this is Mark Adams. Overall, inventory looks pretty tight right now on both NAND and DRAM. We – sometimes when we head into the summer, you see a bit of a little low on the buying behavior of our customers. Quite honestly at this point in our quarter, we have not seen that and the demand signal seem pretty strong. There is rumors about accumulation and all that stuff, but we have not felt that at this point.
Doug Freedman – RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Goodman from CLSA.
Ryan C. Goodman – Credit Agricole Securities, Inc.: Hi, thanks for taking my question. One of the curious reason we discussed are some of the remaining empty clean room space was going to have to end up being used up to enable the one wide transitions in NAND. So I was curious if you’re seeing a similar dynamic to that, and how we should be thinking about slightly in IMFS, how much open clean room space there is and how much of that you will have to use be up to 16 nanometers?
D. Mark Durcan: Yeah. Well, 16 nanometers for us is a very easy capital equipment transition, because there’s a planner node for a planer node and you’ll recall that we made the transition to a different kind of planner, but a planner NAND cell when we move to 20-nanometer. so if you look at Micron’s 20-nanometer storage element, it’s very different than the other folks. It’s the high-k dielectric and the cell itself is planner, so that technology extends for us, and it’s a relatively easy transition. So I don’t think in terms of big planner requirements for us to move to 16-nanometer. Now, what is true for all of us, I think likely be true for all of us is, moving the 3D is going to consume significant amount of incremental clean room capacity to maintain the same wafer output. But the productivity of that transition is very, very high. So it makes sense to go ahead and do that. Now, relative to that question for Micron in our fab in Singapore, a wholly owned NAND fab in Singapore, we have a lot of clean room space there and we can get rolled on our transition to 3D NAND without having NAND in the incremental clean room space.
Ryan C. Goodman – Credit Agricole Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. And then just different areas, high mix in RAM has recently came out with a settlement announcement. So I think it’s down to just you as the remaining participant in litigation with DRAM. Is there any update on there in terms of timing or expectations or anything you can help us with there?
D. Mark Durcan: There is an appeal that’s on file now that I believe is heard again in about a year.
Ryan C. Goodman – Credit Agricole Securities, Inc.: Okay, thank you.

Kipp Bedard: And now I'll turn the call over to Mr. Mark Durcan. Mark?
Mark Durcan: Thanks Kipp. I’d like to start today with an overview of the key developments during the quarter and follow up with a few strategic and industry updates. Then I’ll turn it over to Ron for a financial summary and we’ll close with Mark Adams discussing key developments in our business units, operations and market conditions. Our second fiscal quarter was highlighted by improving market fundamentals in memory, along with solid execution from an operations and financial perspective. We had significant growth in key segments, including SOCs and server DRAM. Personal Systems, a segment which has been a drag on our financial performance for some time, has rebounded significantly due mostly to structural supply shifts in the market. As we suggested in the last earnings call, we took a significant step forward with the successful restructuring of our supply agreement with Inotera, effectively doubling the wafer output we receive from them. We’re pleased with the increased scale and profit opportunity this restructuring process provided. As you will have noted in the release, revenue in the quarter was up about 13%, with strong growth in DRAM and NAND. Gross margins were up significantly from 12% to 18%, again with improvements in both DRAM and NAND. Ron will get into more of the detail for the quarter from a financial perspective. We’re building a very large and diversified memory business and remain focused on making capital and segmentation decisions to optimize margin and free cash flow over time. The Elpida acquisition process remains on track. Creditors voted in favor of the reorganization plan and the Tokyo District Court approved the plan at the end of February. In addition, all of the country and regulatory approvals have been completed. Closing the transaction remains subject to the satisfaction of waiver and waiver of certain conditions, including finalization of the Tokyo District Court’s approval order under Japanese bankruptcy rules and recognition of Elpida’s reorganization plan by the U.S Bankruptcy Court in Delaware. We believe Elpida’s financial performance is consistent with current market industry trends. A successful close will increase our overall trade memory capacity by about 45% from today’s level without impacting industry supply. This capacity initially will be all DRAM. However, our 300 millimeter capacity is fungible and can support other advanced memory manufacturing technology. We’re taking steps to enable flexibility to transition a portion of our capacity demand should market demand and returns on our investment warrant. I mentioned last quarter that we would continue to look for ways to streamline all of our manufacturing operations, including the 8-inch front-end capacity. With that in mind, we made the decision to sell our 200 millimeter image sensor fab in Avezzano, Italy in Q2. We believe this is a positive step to keep us focused on memory market and optimize our overall margin structure. We don’t have any other plans to announce today, but we will continue to look for opportunities to streamline our operations. In terms of the memory market, supply dynamics in particular appear to be healthy looking forward. We believe the DRAM industry wafer capacity will be down in both 2013 and 2014 and process technology upgrades are being stressed out, thereby reducing supply growth compared to historical trends. In the NAND market, we see a favorable supply and demand balance. We have the benefit of significant demand growth in several applications such as SSDs and smartphones, coupled with generally stable supply conditions due to slowing process technology changes. I’ll stop here and turn it over to Ron and Mark before returning for Q&A.
Ronald Foster: Thanks Mark. The end of our second quarter fiscal 2013 was on February 28. On our website you’ll find the schedule containing certain key results for the quarter as well as guidance for the third quarter. That information is also presented on the following slides. For the second quarter we reported a net loss of $286 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, on net sales of $2.1 billion. These results, compared to the previous quarter’s net loss of $275 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, on net sales of $1.8 billion. We made a reporting change in the second quarter to reclassify gains in losses on foreign currency from other operating income and expense to other non-operating income and expense. This non-operating classification provides better comparability with the results of our semiconductor peers. The historical periods have been reclassified to match the current period presentation. Accordingly, operating income for the second quarter, although a loss of $23 million, improved when compared to the operating loss in the first quarter of $97 million. Included in the $23 million operating loss for the quarter is $62 million charge in other operating expense for the projected loss on the pending sale of our Avezzano Italy facility which we announced on February 25. Included in this transaction which is expected to close in the third quarter, is the assignment of our wafer supply agreement with Aptina. This sale will the second spin off of 200 mm production capacity following the sale of our Japan fabrication facility in 2011. Going forward we may restructure and dispose of other assets as we continue to optimize our manufacturing operations and focus on our expanding core business opportunities as Mark mentioned. In the non-operating category, we recognized losses on currency hedges relating to the Elpida Rexchip purchase amounting to $120 million in the second quarter. This is a result of the yen significantly weakening in the quarter. The hedge program we entered into at the signing of the sponsor agreement provided protection from a strengthening yen, while allowing for partial participation in any purchase price reduction if the yen weakened. With the weakening of the yen, approximately one half of the savings from the lower purchase price for Elpida is reflected as a loss on the hedge and has been included in our income statement for the quarter. Any reduction in purchase price will not be recognized on our balance sheet until the transaction is closed using the exchange value at that time. We do not provide any guidance on hedging gains or losses given the extreme volatility of the yen at this time. Non-operating expense in the second quarter also includes a $31 million charge associated with the repurchase of $464 million of face amount of 2014 convertible bonds. I will touch on this in more detail in a few minutes. Also in the results for the second quarter are favorable non-recurring adjustments to income taxes of $19 million relating to two non-U.S. jurisdictions. Turning now to operating results and outlook. Trade NAND bit sales in the second quarter increased compared to the prior quarter primarily as a result of production increases from higher output of 20-nanometer devices. Trade NAND average selling prices were relatively flat quarter-to-quarter. We continue to see growth in SSD sales which increased just over 40% in the second quarter compared to Q1. Mark will provide more detail on these trends in a few minutes. Guidance for Q3 trade NAND is as follows. Estimated trade NAND selling prices will be down mid-single digits quarter-to-date including the projected effect of mix for the quarter. Bit costs are expected to be down mid-single digits while bit production is expected to be up mid to high single digits. Key trends for Q3 affecting this guidance are, we expect a higher density product mix in both the NAND solutions group and the embedded solutions group, lowering both ASP and cost per gigabyte while increasing volumes, resulting in similar margins overall. In ESG the density increase is coming mainly from automotive and consumer applications. In NSG we expect to sell an increasing number of SSD drivers with greater capacity per drive which slightly lowers the average ASP and cost per gigabyte. And we continue the migration to 20-nanometer process technology resulting in lower costs and increasing bit output. We expect to bit crossover this quarter. DRAM revenue in the second quarter increased 24% compared to the previous quarter primarily as a result of a 38% increase in bit sales, partially offset by 10% decrease in average selling price. The higher DRAM production was achieved in the second quarter due to strong operational performance and higher volumes from Inotera. The DRAM average selling price decrease in the second quarter is primarily caused by a higher concentration of sales into the PC market as a result of increased production taken from Inotera. These sales have lower per bit selling prices as well as lower per bit costs compared to other DRAM products in our portfolio. Wafers acquired from Inotera in the second quarter increased 26% as the new supply agreement took effect January 1. DRAM bit costs decreased 18% quarter to quarter, driven primarily by the higher concentration of lower cost products from Inotera. Overall, gross margin across all our DRAM products increased quarter to quarter by about six points. Note that our cost of wafers from Inotera will vary under the new supply agreement as market prices for DRAM products increase or decrease. The new Inotera structure is expected to be a net positive to our income and cash flow in Q3 as it was in Q2. Guidance for Q3 DRAM is as follows. Quarter to date selling prices for DRAM products, included the projected mix effects for the quarter are up mid-single digits compared to the Q2 average. Projected bit costs are down mid to high single digits and projected production volume is up a couple of percent. Key themes endpoints in this guidance are, 4 gigabit DDR3 volumes continues ramping with the effective improving margins while muting 30 nanometer bit growth and comprised over one half of DRAM bit sales in the second quarter. We expect an increase in mix of our 30 nanometer DRAM moving into the server and networking segments. We’re seeing a somewhat higher percentage of our total bit production from Inotera, with improving product mix and costs that move directionally with prices in the market minus model. And output in the third quarter is muted as we plan to reconfigure a portion of our current DRAM capacity to enable NAND flexibility as Mark previously mentioned. NOR sales decreased 14% in the second quarter, in line with our seasonal expectation. NOR revenue and costs in the third quarter are expected to be relatively flat compared to Q2. SG&A expense in the second quarter was below our guided range as a result of lower costs associated with pending legal matters. We expect SG&A expense in the third quarter to be between $135 million and $145 million. R&D expense was $214 million in the second quarter and is expected to be between $225 million and $235 million in the third quarter. With the termination of the DRAM joint development program with Nanya virtually no DRAM development costs were shared with Nanya during the second quarter. The level of R&D expense in any given quarter could vary based on the timing of product qualifications and the volume of development wafers process. The company generated $234 million in cash flow from operating activities in the second quarter, roughly flat compared to the prior quarter. Cash flow from operating activities in the second quarter includes a negative shift in working capital accounts within the normal scope of fluctuations that we see quarter to quarter. Total inventories decreased slightly in the second quarter compared to Q1. The second quarter ended with cash and investments, including non-current investments of just under $2.8 billion. Expenditures for property plant and equipment in the second quarter were $353 million, and we still expect total expenditures for the fiscal year to be between $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion. Note however that quarterly expenditures can vary depending on the timing of equipment receipts. We successfully completed an offering of $600 million in convertible notes the first week of February. We also entered into caps calls to effectively minimize the dilution of these convertible notes. The bulk of the proceeds were used to repurchase $464 million base amount of our 2014 convertible notes that are coming due, effectively refinancing them out to 2018 and 2020. We paid holders a price very close to the market price for the notes. However, the accounting for the early redemption resulted in a non-cash charge of $31 million I mentioned earlier. Depending on market conditions, we may repurchase additional 2014 notes prior to their maturity. Concurrent with the convertible note offerings, we published some recent financial information on Elpida, including pro forma financial summaries. These pro formas present historical financial information for Micron and Elpida as if the acquisition of Elpida Rexchip had already occurred, including the effect of purchase accounting. Elpida’s U.S GAAP financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012 reflects an impairment charge of $2.8 billion to write down property plant and equipment to its estimated share value as of that date. As part of the pro forma adjustments PP&E is assumed to be further written down in purchase accounting by an additional approximate $2 billion to a new value just over $1 billion, resulting in the fair value of the net assets acquired equally in the purchase price. As a result the Elpida Rexchip acquisition represents an approximate 45% increase in Micron's wafer capacity with only a 15% increase in depreciation expense. Now I will turn it over to Mark Adams for his comments. Mark?
Mark Adams: Thanks, Ron. I am going to provide some more detail on our second quarter operating performance as well as share some observations about the overall market environment in the memory industry. Our NAND Solutions group recorded a 15% quarter-on-quarter revenue increase. Coming out of the holiday season, we were watching for potential dollar pressure in market pricing. However, NAND pricing was favorable in our Q2 as end markets for SSDs, smartphones and tablets remained strong demand drivers for increased NAND bits. Micron's trade NAND was basically flat even while somewhat limited by growth in the high density solid state drives that has a decreasing effect on the ASP per gigabyte calculation. Margins improved in the quarter benefiting by increased shipments of our industry-leading 20-nanometer node improving our cost per gigabyte quarter-on-quarter. We shipped 1.1 billion gigabytes in our trade NAND in the quarter. We continue to grow our presence in the storage category with products aimed in segments such as personal storage, cloud and data center storage, and I/O accelerators for the data center. We shipped roughly 1.3 million solid state drives in our second quarter, up over 40% when compared to our first quarter. In Q2, SSDs represented 20% of our trade NAND business. If you include NAND component sales to SSD providers, around 40% of our trade NAND bits go into solid state drives. Our development of enterprise class SSDs is progressing well. Revenue roughly doubled last quarter, albeit off of a low base and continues to be an area of investment going forward. We began customer shipments of our P320H SLC based PCIe SSD and continuous strength in our SATA and [SAS] product roadmaps, positioning Micron as a broad provider of enterprise storage class products. On the technology and operations front, we are making steady technical advancements with both our planar and 3D NAND technologies. We began shipping our 20-nanometer TLC NAND flash and continued to increase our 20-nanometer MLC production as well. Our 20-nanometer ramp is on track and we expect production crossover in the current quarter. Keep in mind, some of our more value-added segments like SSDs often require additional time before utilizing the most leading edge process. This quarter, we will commence volume sales of our 20-nanometer based SSDs, including our recently announced M500, which ships in terabyte class entities with very competitive price points. MLC represented about 80% to 85% of our wafer production in Q2 with SLC and TLC essentially splitting the remainder. Sales for our DRAM solutions group in the second quarter reflect the improving ASCs Ron referenced, combined with strong growth in bit sales [led] by increased volumes resulting from our new arrangement with Inotera. We are very pleased with the additional scale, stable gross margin percentage and operating margin leverage and strong market which this new structure provides. Revenue for DST was up 26% and our gross margins for DRAM overall improved by close to 600 basis points quarter-over-quarter. We were pleased with the direction of several of our [DSC] segments. On the service side, we increased shares significantly at key OEMs and cloud service providers. Q2 was a record quarter in this segment with shipments of over 200 million gigabit equivalents. DRAM bit shipments in networking were up 20% compared to our first quarter and now represents roughly 17% of our overall DRAM revenue. We had another strong quarter and made progress to expand beyond the traditional large OEM business to smaller customers and distributors in the sales of our networking portfolio. DDR3 volumes eclipsed DDR2 volume for the first time and we are now sampling DDR4. RLDRAM continued to gain momentum and we had a strong design activity with enablers and OEM’s for HMC, Hybrid Memory Cube. From a market standpoint, U.S carrier CapEx for LTE deployment is strong and data center networking remains a bright spot for investment by key OEM’s. On the operations front, we hit big crossover facility nanometer in Q2. We anticipate that we’ll be able to ship 25 nanometer technology and volume during our second half 2013 calendar year. in addition, our team continues to make progress on the development of our 20 nanometer product as we look to start sampling that project technology by the end of the calendar year. DRAM pricing has strengthened from the bottom and is up mid-single digits from the Q2 average quarter to date. Obviously, as with any recovering pricing environment, the channel or spot market starts out in front of our OEM contract pricing. While there remains a gap between spot and contract pricing, it is narrowing and we see that as a continuing dynamic in Q3. Channel inventory is very tight and we are currently in allocations to several channel and OEM customers. the DRAM supply and demand balance appears to be favorable and we are well positioned to capitalize that going forward. Sales by the Wireless Solutions Group were down 19% quarter over quarter, with a slowdown in the sale of feature phone driven products, including wireless NOR and SOC NAND.
two: In anticipation of the Elpida close, we continue to work on rationalizing our product lines from a margin perspective as we seek to blend the best of the Elpida portfolio with our Micron product and technology. Our focus will continue to shift from feature phones to smartphone and tablets going forward, with a product portfolio focused on low power DDR2 and DDR3 as well as a growing portfolio around EMCP and e-MMC. From a market perspective, improving pricing trends in PC DRAM and NAND is starting to positively impact the mobile market. We expect smartphone units to be at close to be up close to 40% in 2013, which is better than our initial forecast coming into the year driven by improved growth for entry level smartphones. In addition higher end smartphones continue to be significantly growing memory content, in particular for DRAM which is expected to increase roughly 30% to 40% year over year. Our Embedded Solutions Group had a record revenue quarter in Q2 of roughly $282 million, with strong continued operating margins of 23% in what has traditionally been a slower seasonal quarter. This is our fourth consecutive quarter of record revenue. We benefited from strong retail demand in Japan and the Americas. DRAM was a particular highlight driven by automotive and industrial, medical, military segments. We’re ramping 45 nanometer NOR which now represents over 60% of our high density shipments and we’re growing our presence in EMMC for the embedded segment with that revenue up 50% quarter over quarter. Excluding these extraordinary charges that Ron alluded to, we were encouraged with the improvement in our operating performance in the second quarter. In addition, we continued to make progress on our overall cost structure. SG&A and R&D were in line with our guidance. We continue to drive our inventory lower. In fact, inventory was down $110 million quarter over quarter, which represents a decrease of over $350 million year over year over the past 12 months. The sale of our Avezzano imaging fab is a good example of the steps we’re taking to improve our long term operating efficiency. Our management team continues to work on integration plans as we prepare for the close of our Elpida transaction. As we’ve interacted with the Elpida team members in planning the new Micron, we have grown more impressed with the people and resulting product and technology capabilities. Our customers have been extremely supportive of the acquisition and Micron’s overall strategy. They clearly understand how memory is evolving to new applications and form factors as part of a solutions orientation away from the standard commodity module. We are optimistic that end markets such as mobile, server, networking enterprise and embedded will continue to drive strong demand for our products and thus feel that both DRAM and NAND will stay in good supply and demand balance in Q3. With that I will hand it back over to Kip.
Kipp Bedard: Thanks, Mark. We would now like to take questions from callers. (Operator Instructions) With that we would like to open up the phone lines.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Monika Garg - Pacific Crest: First question is, given that Inotera has spent pretty low CapEx in the past two years and they also guided to low CapEx for 2013. Could you maybe comment on where do you think Inotera is in its NOR transition roadmap and especially in comparison them to Micron's NOR transition?
Mark Durcan: So this is Mark. The Inotera fab is really just in the last phases of completing the 30-nanometer ramp. That CapEx is really pretty much completely funded at this point. So the forward-looking CapEx for them will occur late in 2013 and into the first half of 2014 to drive a 20-nanometer transition. I wouldn’t expect that to be overly steep but it could occur throughout the totality of 2014 with most of the CapEx coming in the front half of that year.
Monika Garg - Pacific Crest: Okay. And then the, last question, Elpida, could you kind of give us any idea on what will be the spend on CapEx last year or do you see that CapEx to need to ramp up since Elpida was not able to spend enough money due to bankruptcy?
Mark Durcan: We are not going to comment on what Elpida has been doing on their internal operations. What we have told you before relative to forward-looking CapEx for Elpida, is that on average it just looks similar to our own technology migrations and capital intensity which we don’t believe is overly burdensome.
Operator: Thank you, ma'am. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs: First of all, you mentioned or alluded to the fact that you will be shifting some DRAM capacity to NAND over the coming quarters. Can you maybe give us anymore color on what the magnitude of that shift might be and in what facilities?
Mark Durcan: We are not going to comment on particular facilities. And really what I intended to convey to you is that we were making steps to provide ourselves with flexibility to make those moves, but not necessarily a commitment to any particular timeline or magnitude of those changes. So I think what you will see is activity going on at Micron fabs in order to lay the ground work so that we have the flexibility to do that. In the short-term what that means is more engineering activity and a small amount of incremental tool installations and minor disruptions in ongoing operations, but no significant capacity decisions are made at this point.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs: Fair enough, thanks. And then maybe as a follow-up, can you maybe update for us your assumptions about what the NAND industry will do in terms of big growth for the year overall? And then where Micron expects to come in within that, given what you just talked about in the last question. Thanks.
Mark Adams: Jim, this is Mark Adams. I think the numbers, we kind of based our planning around in the 30% to 40% range of the NAND bit growth and I would expect Micron to be to the upper end of that range but basically right around there.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs: So that’s an incremental tick-down for the industry relative to what you talked about before, is that correct?
Mark Durcan: Just slightly, Jim, yeah.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Glen Yeung with Citi. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup: Can I just clarify a point, because when I hear your forecast -- not forecast but your statements about ASPs for the quarter in DRAM. Is it right to say that what's really happening is as you take on more Inotera wafers, it actually impacts the ASP increase because of mix but it actually is still contributing solidly to the profitability.
Mark Durcan: Yeah, I think that’s right. There's really two things driving the cumulative impact on ASPs for us. One is the relative [lag] contract spot and the other is the change in our mix that has occurred with the addition of the Inotera increment. Now over time obviously we’ll start moving more of that capacity into value-added segments. But the initial slug of capacity came in the PC area.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup: That’s an important point. Second thing Mark, actually just to clarify, you made a statement about channel inventory being very lean. I just wanted to clarify, when you look into distributors, you don’t feel like those guys are trying to build inventory as they sometimes do when pricing is rising and related to that, are you also on allocation for NAND? You suggested you were selling DRAM.
Mark Durcan: The answer to the first question is we don’t think that the distributors are in a good inventory position at this point relative to six, 12 months ago. We think it’s a pretty lean there as well. Quite honestly there is just not that much capacity available for those channels for them to take that position. As it relates to the NAND piece of the equation, there are certainly pockets of NAND that are in tight constraint as well. A lot of that is driven by the production mismatch sometimes what the requirements are on higher density SSDs. So we’re seeing real tough pockets on the [limits] of available supply for some of the SSD categories.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup: Just one last quick question. Thinking about the pull that you’re seeing for DRAM from now a variety of end markets, not just normal PC, I wonder if you could rank the end markets now in terms of what areas are pulling DRAM at the greatest or fastest growth rate be it server, networking, mobile or PC.
Mark Durcan: So what we’re seeing in terms of overall raw capacity, it would be -- mobile certainly would be at the top of that list. PCs are probably second when you factor in tablets and it depends where you put tablets in the overall ranking. Server is actually pretty significant. You’ve got single digit growth, but pretty significant server DRAM content growth and that’s becoming more and more of a growth category in terms of bit consumption. And of course you’ve got the automotive and networking as you go down that list.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup: Is it fair to say that PC demand, ex tablets, is not so good right now?
Mark Durcan: Yeah, but in balance remember now it’s kind of a science as you just highlighted. When you’re a manufacturer of DRAM you’ve got to make those calls on production based on where those products are going. You can’t just take a mobile bit and make it available a PC guy or vice versa in a given production period. So the unit growth in PC might not be super high, but the balance of PC bits and PC demand is pretty healthy right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Congratulations. Mark, I’m just curious on the NAND pricing environment. So typically this time of year is a seasonally weak period. In addition you’ve got the largest NAND buyer in the world going through a well-publicized weaker than expected demand cycle, inventory work down ahead of perhaps a new product launch in a few months. I guess I’m curious, your expectation for NAND pricing for the balance of the year and at what point independent of getting the Elpida asset do you think about raising the core CapEx of Micron from that 1.6,1.9 to maybe something higher?
Mark Adams: This is Mark Adams. I’ll take the first part of the question. The NAND business is kind of funny when you think about where it was and where it is today. It used to be a very seasonal business. You had memory card and USB and MP3 players all over driven by either back to school or the holiday sales. Today where you see NAND bits going, that’s more diversified and less seasonal. So you referenced some changing customer dynamics around NAND, but in general the demand driver is still really solid coming out of the holiday period as I mentioned in my opening comment. And we think it looks pretty good balanced when you think about 30% to 40% bit growth and when you still think about strong demand across a growing SSD environment, smartphones now we’re growing the unit. We’re taking on some more content. We think overall when you couple that with tablets it’s a real healthy outlook for us in the remainder of 2013 calendar.
Ronald Foster: Let me take the CapEx piece. Let me take the CapEx piece. We're going to be very disciplined on CapEx here moving forward, and there is a lot of good reasons for that. First of all, of course, I already mentioned, we've got options relative to the capacity we have in terms of how we move that around between the various technologies and market segments to optimize margin. that can all be done relatively cost effectively. So I think in terms of, that’s our most desirable way to adjust our capacity to match any imbalances we see. But beyond that there is a couple of reasons why it -- I think you will see that Micron in particular maybe others be somewhat reticent as they think about putting new fabs online and that’s this whole technology environment that we see today relative to -- we have 20-nanometer in volume production. I think most of the folks are working on technologies down as low as maybe be 14-nanometer for planar. But beyond that most of the competitors are working on 3D and you know there is just a big mismatch in the type of capacity you put in place for 3D versus what you put in place for those end of life planar technologies. And so I think people are going to be pretty circumspect about how much capital they go spend on their capacity over the next couple of years while their prepping for a 3D transition sometime out in 2015-2016.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Mark, that’s helpful. Would you guys ever think about putting NAND inside of Inotera or will that stay predominantly a DRAM facility?
Mark Durcan: We are not going to talk about which fabs we would or wouldn’t consider. We will consider, actually all our fab, all our 300-mm fabs I think are candidates and we are not going to be forecasting which ones we may or may not do.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Guys, one last quick one for Ron. Ron, when you look at the OpEx growth that you guys are kind of guiding to this quarter, how much of that is just improved revenue outlook versus maybe some one-offs. Are they on the legal front or some R&D stuff that you have to get done that’s driving that? I am just trying to get a sense of what's variable growth versus maybe some stuff that just had to get done?
Ronald Foster: Yeah, John, in terms of the OpEx risk last quarter, we had a couple of favorable [effects] I called out in the SG&A side regarding legal expenses, and they just happen to be lighter related to some of those legal activities that are hard to predict and they have lumpiness in accruals. On the R&D side, it varies, as I commented related to wafer calls and timings of releases of products to production. So some of that’s shifting between COGS and R&D, so it's a question of which bucket we put it in. So you need to understand that where in many cases it's just moving dollars around. But the guidance I gave you for the third quarter is roughly in line with where we have been historically and I would see it as a more normal trend line.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Steven Chin with UBS. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Steven Chin - UBS: First question is on the conversion of DRAM capacity to NAND. I think a couple of years back when some of your peers were doing that every so often, I think it took them about a month or so, maybe a little more than that to get the full yields on the asset conversion. Can you talk about how long it would take for you guys to achieve the same improved yields after converting to NAND capacity given to be fully utilized premium space in most of your fabs.
Mark Durcan: I can't vouch for your timeframe on what the competitors have done previously [lost] at mature yields. However, I would say that anything that we would consider would be on a much lower frequency than switching back and forth to take advantage of short market cycles. It would be much more along the lines of permanent transitions as opposed to high-frequency change to capture small changes in temporary market conditions.
Steven Chin - UBS: Thanks, Mark. My other question is just in terms of memory content, can you guys talk about what the current NAND content is in SSDs in terms of sweet spot and where you expect to be in the year. And similarly, can you also run through the same for mobile DRAM and PC DRAM.
Mark Adams: Sure. I am assuming you are referring to the volume segment to client business. On average it's kind of in the 127-128 gigabyte on the client side. When you look at the enterprise part of the business, obviously a little bit higher, towards the, somewhere in the mid-240 on the enterprise side and we think that will continue to go up. As I mentioned earlier, it's interesting that we had a little bit of a negative impact on the ASP per gigabyte calculation as you go to higher density drives. But we think that will continue to go, as far as the density consumption, that will continue to go up throughout the year both in the client SSDs.
Steven Chin - UBS: And how about for mobile DRAM products going to smartphones and also PC DRAM?
Mark Adams: Well, I think what we're seeing in general on that side is continuing increase in content albeit at a much lower amount or quantity if you will. If you look at gigabytes and gigabits -- DRAM's based on the gigabyte per your handset. In the smartphone business we’re projecting it's up about 37% year-on-year. If you look at NAND in the premium segment, which is up double digits as well, we’re seeing some of the tail off in some of the feature phone environments. But we think DRAM and NAND will continue to get pretty solid growth in content. Again it's nowhere near in comparisons to what SSD’s volume is in terms of storage content, but again increasing content nonetheless.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets: If you could talk a little bit about helping us understand how much of the business is presently exposed to contract based pricing versus pricing that we're able to see in the marketplace on spot?
Mark Durcan: Well Doug, as you know, we've increased our capacity a lot in terms of the NAND business with our restructure of the Intel relationship. On the DRAM side, this is the first quarter that we're seeing some of the effects of the Inotera volume and obviously Intel – the Elpida deal hasn't closed. So we're still more heavily weighted to OEM contract pricing in the volume markets, specifically and it's obviously true in specialty. So our model today is pretty heavily focused on contract and that's why as I mentioned in my earlier comments that that lag effects shows up in our ASP and Micron relative to what you see in the DRAM exchange. But we see that gap closing in Q3, like it normally does in a recovery market.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets: Is there any chance that we’d get to a point in the industry that you guys feel comfortable enough with how much business is being done and the visibility that you have on that business such that you’ll offer revenue gross margin and EPS guidance?
Ronald Foster: Doug, this is Ron. One of the – that's a good question about stability. One of the challenges we have in trying to give hard guidance if you will is just the variability in our pricing. Historically it's been related to wild variability and volatility in ASPs and PC DRAM pricing for example. Going forward, we have the added challenge of a very nice mix of products that we've been able to develop in the recent years and it continues to expand and as you've seen us call out in conference calls, we have a lot of mix adjustments we have to do in our messaging. With that combination of ASP volatility, which at least is still with us to-date and variation and mix, it's pretty challenging to try to call it. But we do try to point you as you know on the direction of where we think things are headed as best we can.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Berenbaum with MKM Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Daniel Berenbaum - MKM Partners: Real quick on the sale of the Avezzano fab. Does that mean your – when does that close and does that mean that the imaging category will finally just go to zero for you guys?
Mark Durcan: It will be very close to zero post-close which should happen sometime in the May timeframe.
Daniel Berenbaum - MKM Partners: So from August on and that, I assume is going to be accretive to your overall results. Can you talk how much – how accretive would that be to gross margin and how much OpEx comes out?
Mark Adams: Daniel, so first of all, it's a May close. So after May we wouldn't have any volume that would shift over. That's when the close actually occurs. In terms of impact on our financials, the Imaging business is a piece of our other non-segment category in our financial statement if you look at our 10-Ks and 10-Qs and it's a predominant share of it, but it's not everything that's in there. If I look at the recent quarters, we have been running relatively negative on margin, not large amounts. It's zeros to tens of millions of dollars kind of range per quarter and often around zero because that’s the target in structuring. So you think about it, in recent history, it's probably a slight improvement, marginally a few million dollars per quarter.
Daniel Berenbaum - MKM Partners: Okay, thanks. And then going back to DRAM, Mark, you had mentioned that you saw DRAM wafer capacity was going down, if I heard that correctly. So in the industry, what gives you confidence that industry wafer capacity goes down and then what industry supply growth do you think we can get from technology shrinks alone.
Mark Durcan: You know the technology nodes are becoming increasingly complicated to drive the shift below 25-nanometer. So if you look at your -- depending on exactly what your process technology node is, you look at anywhere from 10% to 30% increase in complexity, moving to a 20-nanometer node in terms of overall floor space loading and total number of wafer moves. So the big range that people are moving from different places with different tool sets etcetera, but the trend is the same for all of us which is we need more lithography, we need more drives equipment etcetera, to facilitate filling. And although somebody is going to go out and build a new fab which, as I mentioned a little while ago, relative to NAND you have got some impediments with 3D on the DRAM side. You have got EUV technology over the horizon that you are going to build a bunch of bit doubling DRAM capacity in advance of a potential technology shift to EUV. I think there is a lot of reasons why people may look at just living within their existing four walls and not tend to drive wafer capacity down while still driving an increase in bits. Was there a second part to your question?
Daniel Berenbaum - MKM Partners: Well that makes a sense. And just related to that is, so if people live within their own four walls now, as we go through change, what kind of bit growth do you think the industry is on? What kind of path do you think the industry is on purely from shrinks with no additional equipment.
Mark Adams: I think it's in the 20% to 30% range that most people are prognosticating and that looks about right to me.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Steven Fox - Cross Research: Just two questions from me. First of all on server DRAM, you guys mentioned that you were gaining share during the quarter. I was just curious what you would attribute that to? And then secondly just back on SSDs. Referring to the growth rate that you talked about, the unit growth rate. How does that compare to the market and what would you consider your expectations for unit growth on enterprise and client going forward? I know you talked about average capacities but if you could sort of flush that out a little bit more that would be helpful.
Mark Durcan: On the first question as it relates to server, our growth has really been limited to our own capacity which is now increasing and as you look, we have actually had record quarters -- the last four quarters I believe in server, this is the first time we were over 200 million gigabit equivalent. And a lot of it has to do with the amount of server grade quality we have been getting out of our factories which again has been going up dramatically. Micron has been a leader in terms of the server DRAM business for some time and our customers are asking to continue to see out there. So we continue to see growth opportunities and as we ramp more server products we are getting out to the market. As it relates to the -- can you repeat the second part of your question on the SSD side?
Steven Fox - Cross Research: Yeah, I am just trying to understand the unit growth that you gave on SSDs, a little bit better and in terms of perspective on how you think the market is growing? And then what is the sort of outlook for SSDs going forward from a unit standpoint. You talked about average capacity, I am just trying to....
Mark Durcan: Yeah, so I think the overall SSDs we see year-on-year unit growth '13 over '12 in the 60% to 70% range. Of course ours is growing much faster than that. I think part of that is, you know any time you have a new technology like SSDs they were a lot of competitors in the market. Some were just weren’t able to compete long term and that opens up market share for people who are in it for the long term, such as Micron. We have always said that we believe people with access to the NAND, manufacturing the NAND are going to have an advantage and we think it's driven by our growth in the SSD market that’s playing out pretty well. And we are optimistic we are going to continue to outgrow the market in the short term.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Goodman with CLSA. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Ryan Goodman - Credit Agricole Securities: Congratulations on the quarter. Question on the capacity. If you were to shift or convert some of the DRAM capacity to NAND, I know in the past you talked about this being able to happen at a discounted price, but how should we be thinking about incremental cash requirements to get that new NAND volume through a competitive geometry?
Mark Adams: I think the easiest way to think of it is there is a spend for 1,000 wafers per week or 1,000 wafers per month that we would typically make the move DRAM fab 4, the technology node or NAND fab 4 to technology node. It's about the same. So if we want to take a leading edge DRAM fab and move it forward, move it to a leading edge NAND node, it's about same spending that it would be to take the same path and move it forward to the next node in DRAM. It’s that same capital intensity. It's just choosing a slightly different node to transition to.
Ryan Goodman - Credit Agricole Securities: I guess as a follow-up to that then just a little bit, so if you were to mix shift from DRAM to NAND, it’s a positive for margins at face value that you’re shifting into a sector where you probably have one or two shrinks to catch up if you are going just from where you are in DRAM to NAND. Costs are already getting a bit higher in NAND. There is some major transitions around the corner that are still unknown with vertical 3D, whatever it turns into. So I guess how are you thinking about the long term return potential on these conversion costs just between the conversion and the shrink versus -- especially now with DRAM it's looking pretty profitable. So I guess how are thinking about balancing those two opportunities?
Mark Durcan: Well, we’re all about margins. So we’re going to take a look at where we think the margin's going to be for us on a relative basis and it's got to be sustainable. But that’s what I meant when I talked about low frequency and short frequency changes here. We’re not going to be jerking our manufacturing capacity around to take advantage of short perturbations in the market, but we are going to try and align our capacity with the long-term demand and where we think we can drive higher margin business. So we identify an unfulfilled segment of the SSD market. We may want to go after capacity in place to service that. Likewise, if we see something particularly attractive in package-on-package DRAM or something of that nature, we want to make sure we're there too. So we're going to identify those high margin opportunities and move our capacity there to intercept them. Hope that’s not too fuzzy for you, but that's really all I can tell you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Gauna with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities: I was wondering, could you clarify, did your exposure to commodity PC DRAM actually go up on the quarter? Can you give us a sense of may be what that exposure is percentage wise for DRAM? And then also how you feel about that exposure. I know you mentioned that there's a favorable supply demand dynamic going on, but if you could punch through that and talk a little about what you see for PCM market trend? Thanks.
Ronald Foster: If I can help you a little bit with that, it did increase our exposure to personal systems memory, which is what you’re referencing with from around 13% of total revenues in Q1 to around 18% or high-teens in Q2. I think I'll let Mark talk more around the pricing dynamics and the demand dynamics, but those are the favorable points for us.
Mark Adams: Yeah. I'd like to just reinforce the point I touched on a little earlier, which is a mobile DRAM part is not necessarily perishable to a PC DRAM part and vice versa. So as we look at the overall market, both mobile DRAM and PC DRAM are pretty healthy right now. But having said that, as you think about the market conditions, even though the PC unit growth is not -- has been projected to be low single digit to flat year-over-year, it's in pretty good balance right now. The PC market is not oversupplied as we sit here today in March. And so and the mobile market is pretty hot. But we're watching that balance because as manufacturers we have to call it right to keep the balance in good favor and that's what I think helping us both in the PC space. It’s not that end user demand for PCs are up, it's just the economics of supply and demand are providing a pretty favorable business for us in PC.
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities: And if you could help me understand with Haswell coming up, is there another SKU thing (avenue) in terms of maybe DDR3 to DDR4? Or how should we look at the timing of Haswell and what that means for you in terms of picking the right SKU?
Mark Adams: I think we will just continue to work with our customers to work on adoption. We get a little concerned when we try to think too much about what's out in the press and the marketing of these types of technologies. It's really about customer adoptions and manufacturing output aligned to overall demand there. We have got qualified DDR4 product out there to Intel and others (inaudible).
Kipp Bedard: With that, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: Our final question for today's event will come from the line of Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus. Please go ahead, your line is now open.
Dean Grumlose - Stifel, Nicolaus: Hello, this is Dean Grumlose calling in for Kevin. Thank you for taking may call. What are your expectations for gross margin between the various segments of specialty DRAM? Do you expect these will equalize in the longer term or remain stratified in some way?
Mark Durcan: Well good question. I guess to Ron's earlier comments, we generally have a difficult time ultimately predicting ASPs which obviously are 50% of the impact to gross margin. So, maybe I'll just end the call or give you one more chance with questions without trying to lead you to gross margins particularly. We do have a few views but maybe I'll just let that for market speculation for now.
Dean Grumlose - Stifel, Nicolaus: Okay. And regarding Inotera, do you have the flexibility to run different types of specialty DRAM within that agreement or is there any reason this stays tied to the PC area?
Mark Adams: No, we can use that capacity as we see fit.
Dean Grumlose - Stifel, Nicolaus: Okay. One final thought if I could squeeze it in, does the new Inotera agreement change the equity method treatment in the income statement or does that remain the same?
Ronald Foster: Dean, this is Ron. It remains the same. We're about a 40% owner and we take 40% of it on our equity line.
Kipp Bedard: Thank you, Dean. Really appreciate it. We'd like to thank everyone for participating on the call today.

Kipp A. Bedard: And now I'll turn the call over to Mr. Mark Durcan. Mark?
D. Mark Durcan: Thanks, Kipp. I'd like to start today with an overview of the key developments during the quarter followed by a few strategic and industry updates. Then I'll turn over to Ron for financial summary, and we'll close with Mark Adams discussing key developments in our business unit and operations, as well as an update on market conditions. Our first fiscal quarter was somewhat a tumultuous one as we dealt with shifting market demand and internal operations disruptions. Mark will discuss some of the market shifts in more detail later, but at a high level, we continue to see significant growth and opportunity in the products supporting mobile platforms and embedded applications including, of course, SSDs in a more muted environment in personal systems. Our sales volume for both NAND and DRAM was below our initial forecast for the quarter as we experienced some manufacturing and supply-chain challenges. We are confident these issues have been addressed and will not negatively impact fiscal Q2. As you’ll have noted in the release, revenue for the quarter was down about 7% as a result of a 9% decline in DRAM sales and a 4% decline in NAND. Despite generally declining ASPs, gross margins were up slightly quarter-over-quarter with improvements in NAND and NOR partially offset by reductions in DRAM. NAND market prices were up early in the period and trended downwards towards the end of the quarter, although recently, prices seemed to have stabilized. You may recall that our estimated quarter-to-date ASP included the -- including the forecasted mix for the quarter was down mid-teens as a result of our last earnings call -- as of our last earnings call. Prices did stabilized and, in some cases, improved later in the quarter, and this trend has continued into the current quarter. It will continue to be important to contemplate the effects of Micron's specific product mix as it relates to Micron's ASPs as we move through the year. During the quarter, we continued our efforts to streamline the business and focus our team on actions and investments that will either improve our efficiency and cost structure or our ability to deliver leading-edge innovative memory solutions. To this end, we have discontinued most activity into our Solid-State Lighting Program and then moving this program toward a technology-licensing model. We continue to look at ways to streamline all our manufacturing operations including our 8-inch front-end capacity and our back-end operations, particularly as necessary to accommodate any future front-end capacity. As we mentioned at our fall Analyst Day, we remain in discussions with our partners in Taiwan regarding changes to our agreements, including those related to Inotera supply and our joint development relationship. Although there's no assurance when or if the deal will happen, we don't currently believe the outcome will significantly impact our Q2 guidance for bit growth, estimated quarter-to-date ASP, which includes forecasted mix for the quarter, or R&D spending. Until we finalize terms of any changes to our agreements, I'm not able to add any further details, any potential impact, any new agreements may have in the future beyond those statements relative to our fiscal Q2. We are making and will continue to make the strategic choices to align our business strategy and operating model to deliver an optimum value and return for our shareholders through efficient manufacturing and value-added memory solutions. Relative to the Elpida acquisition, the Tokyo District Court has submitted Micron's proposed reorganization plan to the Elpida creditors, and they expect to complete the voting phase by the end of February. In addition, we have entered Phase 1 review in China and continue to work towards government approval of all the required countries. We expect to close sometime in the first half of 2013. In terms of the memory market, we're cautious in the short term but optimistic about the evolving industry supply-demand balance. The industry DRAM supply outlook continues to be favorable. We don't see any substantial new wafer capacity coming to the market, and the latest process technology transitions are simply going to take longer compared to previous generations. The other key variable on DRAM supply is industry capacity shifting away from PC to higher growth categories including mobile and server. This shift results in fewer bits produced in aggregate and should eventually result in a more favorable supply-demand balance in PC DRAM as well. The outlook is also encouraging on the NAND front. We don't see any significant capacity additions to the market in 2013. And as with DRAM, process technology migrations are getting stretched out, which is -- which has the effect of reducing supply growth compared to prior years while demand growth remains robust driven by SSDs, smartphones and tablets. Our technology development and product portfolio is targeting these key segments as we head into 2013, and we are confident about our position in the market. I'll stop here and turn it over to Ron and Mark before returning for Q&A.
Ronald C. Foster: Thanks, Mark. While we're rapidly approaching the end of 2012 calendar year, Micron completed the first quarter of fiscal 2013 on November 29. On our website, we have provided a schedule, as usual, containing certain key results for the first quarter, as well as certain guidance for the second quarter. That material is also presented on a few slides that follow. The first quarter resulted with a net loss of $275 million or $0.27 per diluted per share on net sales of $1,834,000,000. These results compared to the fourth quarter of the previous year of a net loss of $243 million or $0.24 per diluted share on net sales of $1,963,000,000. Total sales in the first quarter were 7% lower than the previous quarter, driven primarily by declines in DRAM and NAND. You will recall that we entered into a series of currency options to mitigate the exposure to changes in the yen denominated purchase price of Elpida prior to the close of that acquisition. The weaker yen at the end of the first quarter relative to when we signed the sponsor agreement would have decreased the U.S. dollar equivalent purchase price if we'd closed the transaction at quarter end. The weaker yen also reduced the fair value of the options we entered into at the time of signing. The resulting mark-to-market adjustment of the options resulted in a $62 million loss in the first quarter. Approximately, $9 million of this loss was the reversal of a gain recognized in the previous quarter as a result of a strengthening yen across that period. During the first quarter, with the termination of Transform Solar's operations, the fab facility previously leased the Transform reverted back to Micron. A $25 million gain was recognized in other operating income associated with the release from that lease obligation. The $54 million net interest expense includes $29 million of noncash interest expense from imputed interest on the bifurcated convertible notes that we have outstanding. Trade NAND bit sales in the first quarter decreased compared to the prior fourth quarter. As Mark indicated, we experienced some manufacturing challenges in the quarter, which reduced output in Q1. Trade NAND average selling prices increased approximately 8% comparing the first quarter to the previous quarter as we continue to sell more NAND in the premium segments with higher ASPs, such as SSD and MCPs. Estimated trade NAND selling prices are down high single digits quarter-to-date, including the forecasted product mix for the quarter. Trade NAND cost per bit is expected to be down high single digits in the second quarter, while trade NAND bit productions plan to be up low teens in the second quarter as our 20-nanometer wafer output doubles compared to Q1. DRAM revenue in the first quarter decreased 9% compared to the previous quarter, primarily as a result of an 11% decrease in DRAM average selling prices stemming primarily from weaker PC segment demand relative to the fourth quarter. Quarter-to-date selling prices, including projected mix impact for the quarter, are down double digits compared to the Q1 average. We anticipate the Q2 mix will be somewhat heavier to personal systems. DRAM cost per bit declined approximately 5% quarter-to-quarter, and we are forecasting bit cost for DRAM in the second quarter to be down low double digits as we continue to transition to our 4 GB DDR3 product set, which comprised approximately 1/3 of the DRAM bit sales in the first quarter. Bit production in the second quarter is expected to be up double digits compared to the first quarter. NOR sales were relatively flat in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter and remained at approximately 12% of total revenue. NOR revenues second quarter is expected to decrease seasonally, approximately 10% compared to the first quarter. We anticipate NOR cost reductions to offset selling price reductions in the second quarter. SG&A expense in the first quarter was below our guided range as a result of lower costs associated with pending legal matters and lower personnel costs from our variable pay plans. During the first quarter, certain variable pay plans were suspended resulting in cost reductions across our global operations. We expect SG&A expense in the second quarter to be between $135 million and $145 million. R&D expense was $224 million in the first quarter and is expected to be between $220 million and $230 million in the second quarter. The company generated $236 million in cash flow from operating activities in the first quarter. First quarter ended with cash and investments including noncurrent investments of just over $2.8 billion. Expenditures for property plant and equipment in the first quarter were $538 million, and we still expect total expenditures for the fiscal year to be between $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion, slightly weighted towards the earlier part of the fiscal year. Now I'll turn it over to Mark Adams for his comments. Mark?
Mark W. Adams: Thanks, Ron. Our NAND Solutions Group declined slightly from the fourth quarter. The slight improvement in operating margin for NSG was primarily due to reduced costs in the first quarter associated with the ramp of products on our 20-nanometer process and improved product mix. In addition, our trade NAND pricing was up 8% for the quarter. As NAND has historically been somewhat seasonal, we will be watching post holiday demand signals closely. We continue to be pleased with our solid state drive business as bit shipments were up about 20% quarter-on-quarter. In Q1, SSDs represented 17% of our trade NAND business. If you include NAND component sales to SSD providers, about 35% of our trade NAND bits go into solid state drives. Our development of Enterprise-class SSDs is progressing well. We completed the qualification with the leading enterprise networking customer of our P400E drive with volume shipments scheduled in the first quarter of the calendar year 2013. We're also nearing qualification of our next-generation enterprise SATA drive with major server and storage OEM customers and look for shipments in calendar year 2013 as well. Our SLC-based PCIe P320 H enterprise high-performance storage drive continues to receive positive reviews from both the press and our top customers. On the NAND technology front, we are making steady technical advancements with both our planar and 3D NAND technologies. We began sampling our 20-nanometer TLC NAND flash, which selected controller companies, and we'll begin production in calendar Q1. We saw a slowdown in our 20-nanometer ramp related to the manufacturing issues described earlier, but we still expect production crossover in 3 to 6 months. MLC represented about 80% to 85% of our wafer production in Q1, with SLC and TLC essentially splitting the remainder. Sales for our DRAM Solutions Group in the first quarter reflects slight growth in bit sales volumes eclipsed by decline in selling prices, particularly in the personal systems segment. Despite the lower revenue in the quarter, our operating income line was roughly flat due to lower R&D costs for product qualifications as certain products reach production status in the fourth quarter and are now ramping. While we look for demand drivers such as ultrathin and light notebooks and Windows 8 to stimulate demand in the desktop/notebook segment, we continue our focus on specialty markets such as server, networking, graphics and consumer devices. The networking segment represents about 25% of our DSG revenue. We had another strong quarter and made progress to expand beyond the traditional large OEM [Audio Gap] businesses to smaller customers and distributors in the sale of our networking portfolio. A growing portion of the market is shifting from DDR2 to DDR3-based systems, and we also continue to see early traction for our RLDRAM 3 and Hybrid Memory Cube. We continue to see very strong demand signals from our server customers. 2000 server bit -- 2013 server bit growth year-on-year is forecasted to grow over 40%, and we remain confident we will drive growth in the category. From a product perspective, we added a major new technology to our portfolio with nonvolatile DIMM target mission-critical in memory database applications. Overall, we are positioned well for long-term success in the server segment. On the DRAM operation front, we project to hit bit crossover on 30-nanometer in Q2. We are conscious that as an industry, there are increasing strength challenges to ramp 20- and 30-nanometer nodes as seen as well by our competitors. We are currently forecasting Micron's 20-nanometer transition rate in calendar year 2013. PCO and DRAM pricing stabilized in the second half of our Q1 and is up high single to low double digits so far in December. While it's too early to signal a sustainable trend in terms of improved pricing, we will monitor the tightening supply situation in the market, as well as the seasonality effect on demand. General inventories seem to have returned to normalized level of 3 to 4 weeks down from where we entered the quarter. Sales by the Wireless Solutions Group improved seasonality in the first quarter. New configurations of NAND-DRAM multi-chip packages showed strength in the China mobile market while new DRAM product introductions began to ramp as well. While we continue to be challenged on the bottom line for WSG, we remain bullish about our long-term opportunities in Wireless. Mobile DRAM shipments increased significantly as we were leveraging the ramp of our 30-nanometer base 4-gigabit low-power DDR2 device in both the entry level and high-end smartphone category. We also have strong growth in NAND shipments, most noticeably in the low-end smartphone market which is seeing a transition from standalone NAND to EMCP-based solutions, with e·MMC NAND combined with low-power DRAM. Wireless NOR shipments grew double digits, and gross margins were up nicely in the quarter as a result of cost improvements. Our broad product portfolio combining DRAM, NAND and NOR puts us in a great position to capture a larger share of the Wireless market as we move forward with the focus on growth in DRAM and NAND in particular. The addition of the Elpida's mobile DRAM portfolio will only accelerate this effort. Our Embedded Solutions Group had a record quarter in terms of gross profit and operating income driven by the ramp of 45-nanometer parallel NOR and continued strength in the automotive and industrial segments. We delivered the first customer sample of the 45-nanometer serial NOR and began engineering wafers for 300-millimeter embedded NOR products. One of the particular areas of strength has been the growth of our embedded e·MMC product portfolio. We ramped volume production of automotive products and expanded density offerings of the industrial lineup. We continue to invest in infrastructure and headcount resources to accelerate our embedded growth. In the past year, we opened up engineering systems labs in Munich and Shanghai for joint development and validation; continuing our focus on providing customer-centric solutions and, in many cases, sitting right next to customer design teams. We have advanced our NOR technology leadership with our 45-nanometer 300-millimeter production, and we'll continue to leverage this position to generate profitable growth. Pricing in the embedded space remains stable, and we were able to drive our cost leadership position to improving margins. While we continue to face adverse conditions during our first quarter, we are making progress on a number of fronts. As I mentioned at our Analyst Day conference in October, we are exclusively focused on being the leader in the memory market. Our cash position remains strong as we continue to be operating cash flow positive in Q1. Our inventory remains in check, down from $2 billion within the last 9 months, and we are focused on improving our cost efficiency. Our premium businesses, such as specialty DRAM, SSDs and Embedded Solutions continue to represent growth opportunities for Micron. Our management team continues to work on integration plans as we prepare for the close of our Elpida transaction. We remain optimistic that the reduced capital spending with no new memory fabs on the horizon will lead us to better memory supply and demand dynamics. Our customers have been extremely supportive of the acquisition and Micron's overall strategy. We believe end markets such as mobile, server, networking, enterprise and embedded will continue to drive strong demand for our products. With that, I will hand it back over to Kipp.
Kipp A. Bedard: Thank you, Mark. What we'd like to do now is take questions from callers [Operator Instructions].
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I wonder if you could go into little more details of the manufacturing problem and how comfortable you are that the problem is fixed going into the second quarter?
Mark W. Adams: Yes, Kevin, this is Mark. I don't want to get into too much detail. But I think I could characterize it as really nothing out of the ordinary in terms of the root cause, a combination of different events in front-end, back-end manufacturing, some internal, some external. I think in concert with some knock-on effects that the disruptions created in our overall supply chain really just led to inability to get all the products out. Relative to are we convinced that the problems are behind us, absolutely, relative to those particular issues. I'm not here to promise you we'll never have a manufacturing disruption again, but I think the -- what we encountered this quarter was really sort of a perfect storm in terms of the timing of a number of different events that cumulatively created the issue.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And maybe just to understand, you said that in the second quarter, you're expecting heavier personnel systems on the DRAM side. Is that normal seasonality it seems like that would normally be a weak quarter or servers just got much worse?
Ronald C. Foster: Kevin, this is Ron. The effect here is basically as we were looking at quarter, we had an opportunity to pick some -- up some additional wafers from Inotera. And our conclusion was that, that would marginally improve our gross margin dollars, our gross profit dollars if you will. And so we decide to take that increment, and that is incrementing our PC bits and affected our guidance in terms of what we gave you.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. So it's not the end markets that are shifting at all, just...
Ronald C. Foster: No. It was a mix of just the opportunities we saw in front of us and the ability to pick up some wafers that added a few more dollars to the cash balance.
Mark W. Adams: Yes, and I'd like to make one announcement, too. On the guidance sheet that -- for those of you who are looking at it, you may have an error on the R&D column that lists R&D for the quarter as $1.8 billion. The actual numbers, as Ron has reported, was $224 million. So you will get a corrected version of that sent out within the minutes here. But the corrected R&D number for fiscal Q1 was $224 million. So with that, we'd like to go back to questions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Monika Garg of Pacific Quest.
Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: First question on the DRAM side. So Mark Adams talked about PC OEM DRAM pricing stabilizing during the second half and actually up low double digit in December, but you are guiding DRAM pricing down quarter-to-date low double digits. Just trying to reconcile the 2.
D. Mark Durcan: Basically, the effect you're seeing has to do with just the overall mix and where the bits are going. So the PC bits, which tend to be on the lower side of our pricing that we attained, there'll be more of those PC bits, and that's the overall mix effect will drag that pricing downward.
Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And recently, we have seen in the news and the media that Nanya may not be buying PC DRAM chips from Inotera. And you're also guiding that you are buying some of that capacity. So given that Inotera is a JV between Micron and Nanya, could this lead to increased expenses to Inotera's operations from Micron?
Mark W. Adams: I think we said all we can say relative to any potential or hypothetical deal we might reach, we've told you that we are having discussions with our partners, and we've told you how that has -- what we can relative to how that impacts our Q2 guidance. And I think the bottom line is that the bits we are currently forecasting are what we believe will happen in Q2. And obviously, we'll do a deal if we think it makes sense for Micron.
Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: Okay. Just one last one on NAND side. Could you talk about NAND bit supply growth for both Micron and where do you think NAND industry bit supply growth could be for calendar 2013?
Mark W. Adams: I could start with the industry part, and then I will let Mark jump in with the Micron part. But we're looking at a calendar 2013 based on public information of probably somewhere between 35% and 45%.
Operator: Our next question comes from Betsy Van Hees with Wedbush Securities.
Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: I was wondering if you could go back to the production issue that you had. So you said you have front-end and back-end, but how were yields with your 20-nanometer? There were no issues there? Are things still tracking in line with your expectations?
Ronald C. Foster: Well, relative to 30-nanometer, generally speaking, we made fantastic progress on yields as we move through the quarter and anticipate a continued trend as we move into -- as we move through fiscal Q2. Relative to 20-nanometer, that's actually insignificant piece of our total -- of our output today.
Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay, then can you -- I guess, as we look at 30-nanometer to 20-nanometer transition, how that's going to look?
D. Mark Durcan: Yes, it'll be -- the transition is really starting late in calendar '13. And you could expect that transition to continue through calendar 2014. It's generally on track with what we've been forecasting and timing in line with what we believe the rest of the industry will be.
Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: And then you guys mentioned that you, on the Wireless Solutions Group, you're challenged on the operating profit there. And I was wondering if you could help us understand how things are going to get better in that marketplace when we're seeing sort of a shift to more NAND solutions versus NOR Flash solutions.
Mark W. Adams: Betsy, this is Mark Adams. Yes, the -- first of all, correct me I...
D. Mark Durcan: Yes, sorry. The prior comments that Mark mentioned I think...
Mark W. Adams: Were relative to DRAM.
Mark W. Adams: I think were relative to DRAM. Is that what you were asking, Betsy, around the DRAM, 20-nanometer?
Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Well, yes. And then I was also asking about the Wireless Solutions Group.
Mark W. Adams: Okay, good. So just -- on the Wireless Solutions side, the -- there's a couple of factors that are playing into the options for us. One is the, as I mentioned in my earlier comments, our 30-nanometer LPDDR 3, 4-gigabit part has put us in a very competitive position today, and that is ramping in volume so we can go out and expand our offering there. Secondly, the maturity of our e·MMC product portfolio is opening doors for new sockets as well there. So between the combination of those 2, not only do we get back in the game from a cost perspective but we have a broader product portfolio to bring to market and actually deliver on.
Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: And then my last question, I apologize if you mentioned this, but when we're looking at the estimates for SG&A, I see it's going up to $135 million to $145 million. And it's not just FICA and things like that, that were causing your SG&A to go up.
Mark W. Adams: There's a couple of things. One is we had a -- we're getting back to normal trend line, if you look at our history in terms of SG&A. We had a lower legal expenses in the first quarter. And also we've got some integration costs as we're looking forward to the acquisition that we're -- that we've got a net estimate as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Chin of UBS.
Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Couple of questions on the inventory front. I heard the comments on DRAM channel inventory looking better. But with the anticipated sales of -- or increased sales of PC DRAM for fiscal 2Q, do you think that channel inventory will increase again in the current quarter or do you think there's enough sell-through of bits that that will stay under control?
Ronald C. Foster: I think -- we do think though those are bitsthat would normally go to the PC market indirectly or directly, so we think it's net neutral.
Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And on the NAND side, just given that flash about this time last year, I think your solid state drive business also saw some inventory buildup. What kind of trends are you seeing there right now in terms of…
Mark W. Adams: I think if you go back a year ago, if we go back a year ago, we were coming out at an artificially higher demand curve due to the hard drive situation in Thailand prior to the holidays. I think that effect's gone, and we're pretty bullish. We're trying to grow our SSD business, and the demand signals from our customers are in parallel aligned with that. So we were pretty bullish going into our second quarter on SSDs.
Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Got it. And the last question is in terms of the manufacturing issues in Q1 and how that may have impacted your ability to shift product, was there any business out of the front table in Q1 that you'll be able to make up in Q2?
Ronald C. Foster: There's a very small amount of growth in bit inventory that was offset with cost of good reductions. So when you look at inventory numbers, they're relatively flat. So some of that will come through, but it's a -- it's not as significant relative to the overall quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from James Schneider of Goldman Sachs.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I was wondering if you could comment a little bit more on the move in DRAM spot pricing we've seen. In your view, is that purely due to some of your competitors taking PC DRAM supply offline? And then what kind of impact have you seen in your specialty DRAM businesses on the server or mobile side? Is some of that capacity moving over to those places which is causing the pricing pressure or have you seen a stabilization there?
Ronald C. Foster: Overall, I think that the PC DRAM pricing has to do with the overall supply picture in the overall industry when you look at the market. So I think that the supply side -- and we've referenced kind of what's out in the public on production and investment and capacity and technology transitions, we think that it's been relatively conservative in terms of overall supply growth. So the PC number we think is just kind of a natural evolution of the last 12 to 18 months of that behavior. I think your follow-on comments, did some of those bits make it into our specialty businesses. And while we can't predict that won't happen in the future, we haven't seen it as much because it is not as a matter of just redirecting that capacity. There are technical specifications that go along with it, along -- whether it be performance or temperature requirements and those types of things that, that capacity doesn't automatically become perishable or transferable to other segments. So we haven't seen tremendous pressure. Now having said that, I'll make one qualification to that. We have seen kind of a newer segment in the servers come up that it's a little bit more of a commoditized server for the data center application, the cloud data center application where it's been more of a higher unit but more of a kind of industry standard architecture that doesn't have those specifications, we view that as net-net positive because those bits are better than the PC bits and they're additive to our core server business.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. And then maybe as a follow-on, any update for us on how you see the DRAM industry bit supply in calendar 2013?
Ronald C. Foster: Right now, it shapes up to be somewhere, Jim, between 20% and 30%.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it, that's helpful. And then finally, for me, on the Wireless Group operating profit, can you comment on maybe the difference between the reported operating profit and the actual cash flow out of that group? And maybe highlight any actions you might take to kind of to improve that profitability level going forward?
Ronald C. Foster: James, this is Ron. The -- when you look at cash flow of Wireless Group versus the reported result, the main difference is depreciation/amortization, which affects all of our main business units, if that's the question you're asking. So it's a contributor to the operating cash flow based upon the depreciation component that’s COGS. I'm not sure if that's the question you're asking, though.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I was just wondering if there's any acquisition-related one-timers that would kind of be above and beyond the pure equipment depreciation effect?
Ronald C. Foster: No, not material.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Wong of Wells Fargo.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Could you remind us if the Elpida deal closes on the terms you expect and the timeframe you expect, what your cash requirements might be to support this transaction? And given the current revenue and income statement dynamics, will you need to raise any extra cash or do you have what you need on the balance sheet at the moment?
Ronald C. Foster: In terms of the actual purchase price at close, it was about $750 million in cash that we have to come up with. And you can see the cash balance on our financial statement, we're obviously opportunistically looking at financing situations. The market is pretty good right now, but as we've said before, we tend to look at ones that are covenant-free and focused more on capital leases, which is a normal course of business kind activity as our primary focus. But we'll continue to look at opportunities also to spread our debt exposure over time, our repayment schedule as well, but it's opportunistic based upon market availability.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. And my other question is you were saying that you expect your DRAM mix to be somewhat heavier towards personal systems, so are you seeing a pickup in demand of systems, I assume you may mean PCs by that, or is there some other dynamic that pushes down your demand for your specialty DRAM?
Ronald C. Foster: Yes. The comment was in terms of additional DRAM bits related to the fact that we actually have more availability of bit supply, and so we have more to move into the market. It's not a demand-driven factor. It's basically supply we have available.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ryan Goodman of CLSA.
Ryan Goodman - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: A bit of a follow-up to that last point on the decision to take some of those additional wafers out of the Elpida and go in to the PC market. How do you balance the risk of potential impact to pricing versus the opportunities there? I mean, maybe you could talk about some of the opportunities you see by geography or by segment within the market that help lead to that decision?
Ronald C. Foster: This is Ron. I'll take the first part, maybe Mark and Mark wants to comment on sort of market opportunities. This is a short-term kind of thing that happens periodically. It just happened to be a little bit larger this quarter where there are available wafers from Inotera. And we have an election to actually pick them up or not pick them up, and it's a straightforward economic analysis based upon current market conditions and known potential we have with our market pricing and contractual arrangements with our customers. So we make the decision based on the cash evaluation, and we made the decision to take some in this case.
Mark W. Adams: But in addition to that, if you -- the comments made in our opening discussion around PC OEM pricing, I think the market and the supply base reflects an adjustment of what CT capacity looks like. And so while the overall PC segment doesn't look like a significant growth category, if it's flat, the supply base to that has already kind of contemplated that. We believe that the supply and demand curve is in better shape as reflected by the OEM contract price increases in December.
Ryan Goodman - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And then just another question, this one on the NAND side of things, specifically on client SSDs. I know one of your competitors appears to be making a stronger push in the 3-bit lately, and even has a 3-bit SSD out there. And at the same time, we're seeing another competitor kind of moving in the opposite direction and pushing a little more 2-bit and going more into smartphones and 2-bit SSDs. I'm curious, I know in recent conference, you had mentioned the possibility of 3-bit SSD. But maybe if you could just provide some color on the strategy there going forward?
Ronald C. Foster: Sure. A lot of it depends on the customer and the application you're selling to. We see over time the client SSD business as it continues to scale, and its growth is encouraging. We see kind of the value of different product offerings within client. When you're selling to a major OEM customer, a 3-bit solution won't quite do it. If you're selling to a white box emerging market segment that might accept lower than that type of performance, you might get that -- be able to get there. The other side of the maturity of controller development being able to handle 3-bit will continue to improve. And so do we think in the future that 3-bit per sale SSDs would be viable? Yes. Do we think the market is there today? Probably not, and that's why we continue to focus on performance, high-performance client SSD drives.
Ryan Goodman - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. Just one quick follow-up too on the manufacturing issues. Did that only affect NAND volume or was that also -- was that an impact to DRAM volume as well?
Ronald C. Foster: It hit both sides.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Amir with Lazard Capital.
Daniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Couple of questions here. First of all, as we look at the -- your product mix in both DRAM and NAND, I mean that's been changing here in the past few quarters, how should we be looking at that in the next -- in this fiscal year '13? I mean, what -- should we see your SSD bits growing to potentially 50% of your total NAND or is it kind of mid-30s right now? Is that where you stand in the same question relative to specialty DRAM and PC DRAM?
Ronald C. Foster: I think it's fair to say we don't think 30% the ceiling on SSD bits both part of our portfolio and our SSD pure play customers. So I don't think we're satisfied nor do we think that's the top. We think there's more opportunity, and in fact, that's kind of where we're driving a lot of our go-to-market and development resources.
Mark W. Adams: And in terms of trying to pin down for you what percent of our business can be NAND and DRAM, we're going to try and keep that to ourselves for now.
Daniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then in terms of your Wireless side, I mean you focused a lot on your Analyst Day and since then as well, and focusing on finding ways to penetrate more of the handset market. What can you give us in terms of update, in terms of your product portfolio and your traction that you're getting as you turn around this Wireless segment in terms of getting more content in the smartphone space?
Ronald C. Foster: Well, I think I'll kind of revert back to my earlier comments. We were out of 2 key portions of the business as far as growth opportunities within Wireless, one being low-power DRAM Solutions, which hit us both on the standalone sale of that product, as well as the MCP, as well as our e·MMC offering. And both those product development efforts have progressed really well, and we haven't lacked access to the market. I think what we look at -- in one case, cost position when we were driving too hard to sell that volume in that space and another capability that our e·MMC offering wasn't as mature as the -- as all of our customers would've liked. So we've kind of say today that we have confidence and our products are competitive and able to gain that share of market that we want.
Daniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: And just final question on your NOR business, I mean there's been some news lately that your plans for the fab in Israel, what can you update us on the strategy of your NOR business, I mean in terms of the roadmap here?
Ronald C. Foster: Well, I think that the -- again, we mentioned a bit earlier, we continue to invest in NOR from a technology perspective. We are a leader right now with our 45-nanometer, 300-millimeter product, which gives us a pretty good cost advantage in that business that showed up in the embedded space. And to some extent, it will help us also enable us in the lower end wireless sockets. You made reference to manufacturing rumors that are in the press, and so on and so forth. But what I would say to that is that we still remain very, very committed to NOR. It's a good part of our business an enabling technology for us both in embedded and wireless and from other segments as well, including PC bios applications and consumer applications.
Operator: Our next question comes from Glen Yeung of Citigroup.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Do you guys have a forecast for us what CapEx could be next quarter?
Ronald C. Foster: This is Ron. As I mentioned, we're still projecting $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion for the year. We had about $538 million in the first quarter, and we said we're going to be loaded a little bit heavier to the first half so...
Mark W. Adams: It's tough for us to get too specific, Glen, because timing -- exact timing on acceptance of tools can move, and that can swing that number pretty dramatically quarter-to-quarter even though the same trend line is in place.
Ronald C. Foster: Yes, that's right.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Fair enough. Just with respect to that. The difference between the $1.6 billion and the $1.9 billion, maybe you can just remind us what would lead you to one end or the other end of that range?
Ronald C. Foster: Well, it's a number of variables. One of them is timing, as Mark mentioned, at year-end, right, as how things play through. But it's hard for us to call it much closer than that as we go in the first part of the year.
Mark W. Adams: And, of course, we're always adjusting our proposed product mix and our spend associated with that as we see market condition fall.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Understood. I think on the NAND commentary, you have mentioned that you're watching holiday demand signals to sort of give a census to how you think NAND will progress from here. I know it's a little early for that, but maybe just your initial thoughts on how you see demand trends at the moment from the NAND perspective.
Mark W. Adams: Well, I think quarter-to-date, we feel things are pretty stable. But it's not unusual for some softness and just out of the holiday period, especially given some of the consumer product-driven platforms that NAND consumes or is consuming NAND. So it was only a hedge that we'd like to just kind of follow that on track to make sure that NAND keeps at the current pace.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: [indiscernible]. And one last one [indiscernible].
Mark W. Adams: Sorry, Glen, I’d go a little beyond. I'd say that generally, we're relatively optimistic about the future demand for NAND. We see a lot of growth in end applications that are consuming NAND, including the SSDs that have been alluded to a couple of times already here today. What we don't know about it is what's the macroeconomic environment going to look like. So we're kind of like everyone else here, waiting to find out how that plays out.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Yes, it’s not fun to figure it out at this time. Just one last one. I understand why more PC DRAM is more of a supply issue on your part. But just to be clear about what your visibility is on demand from server, is that looking as you expected to look any better, any worse?
Ronald C. Foster: Yes, I think we're, yes, pretty happy with servers. And we think -- kind of line of sight is that it looks pretty stable and growth were into the bit side for sure, and then the units tracking pretty well. So overall, very favorable.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Fox of Cross Research.
Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC: First, just a question on the SSD market, your own sales of SSDs and cash I just wanted to throw that in, you obviously have a lot of momentum there exiting the quarter. On the client and enterprise side, are you looking for some seasonality in Q1 especially on the enterprise ahead some of your new qualifications? And then within that over the next couple of quarters, are there any competitive dynamics we should keep in mind relative to especially the enterprise side that maybe helping or hurting you guys? And then I have a quick follow-up.
Mark W. Adams: I think I mentioned some of our qualification success in my comments and as an indication that we think the -- our enterprise business will grow. Your reference to seasonality, I wasn't quite clear what you're asking. But we don't -- given the earlier stage of enterprise versus the overall SSD business, we can bet that there's growth around it, and we think our business will continue to grow.
Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC: And well, I guess I was referring to like client demand for SSDs in your first quarter, the first calendar quarter actually.
Mark W. Adams: Yes, even in that category, we think it's still pretty high demand. We don't think -- we think it's up and to the right, right now given the lower penetration of [indiscernible] SSDs even in Q1.
Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC: And competitively, do you feel like there's anything going on where you're taking more of an advantage whether it's channel, near term or product category that we should be thinking of?
Mark W. Adams: Well, I think I'll break it out in 2 pieces. On the client side, there certainly had been some client players who had some financial challenges that might impact our ability to actually go out and capture more share. But overall, so the client -- we like our position in client. I think it's very strong. On the enterprise side, it's a little bit more of a design-win engagement model. So when you pick up something, it tends to be pretty large volumes as they roll that out, as your customer rolls it out. But we -- the only thing I would say is that we're pretty pleased. Our NAND team is pretty pleased with the PCIe products that we've come to market with, and that seems to be a high-growth category even within enterprise. So we're pretty bullish on both segments. One is more of a competitive ability to go out and then deliver volume on the client side and to have some differentiated products in our enterprise solution.
Daniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: And just really quickly, I apologize if I missed this, but in terms of the pricing you're talking about on the NAND side, there were no mix issues that are affecting either the outlook or what we saw on the quarter. I might be unclear on that one.
Ronald C. Foster: No, we would guide you to think that there are always mix issues going on. For example, as Mark just described, we think SSD probably grows for us next quarter. So that's an uplift, for example, over some markets though, every quarter we're dealing with mix-related product movements both in DRAM and NAND.
Mark W. Adams: And if you look at the guidance we gave you in terms of forward NAND pricing for the second quarter, I would say a significant chunk of that is we're looking at mix mainly higher density products going into the channel, for example, and more of our 20-nanometer business related to that higher density. So it is significantly a mix effect. And note the cost per bits is going down correspondingly.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Gauna with JMP Securities.
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: I was wondering, you've talked a lot about the server market here. I understand how your bit growth might be strong given some of the move in servers. But there had been a lot of mix indications in terms of infrastructure data center demand. Can you maybe help us parse what's happening to you in terms of bit density growth and maybe what you think the underlying growth rate of that market is right now and how that trends in Q1?
Ronald C. Foster: Alex, I think that the bit growth, we've been pretty confident. We still think that's a pretty good growth platform for us in servers. When you look at overall server unit growth, it's still mid to high single digits. But when you look at the bit growth, I think we're somewhere around 45% or 50% bit growth year-on-year in servers. And so, I think the dynamic I was alluding to earlier is you've got kind of your traditional server players in those type of enterprise applications. And then you've got this cloud data center model where there are people who are actually building out these networks that are actually rolling their own servers or going through ODM models. And so their product requirements because of the way the networks are structured and the requirements of the server aren't the same, that the subsegment of server growth, that is a little bit more commoditized.
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's very helpful. I was wondering if I could ask some other question with regards to PCs right now. With all the transition towards convertibles and tablets, can you give us a sense of maybe what average density per PC is doing right now? And then your assumptions on how some of these moves to more atom-based systems or tablet systems might affect DRAM growth in the PC segment going forward in 2013.
Ronald C. Foster: So I'll take the first part of that, maybe Mark and Mark can jump in on impacts of architecture. But basically in 2012 over 2011 we're going to see PC notebook growth rates around 20% and flat to down units, depending on which third party you're looking at. Next year, third-party data suggest units up probably 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, with bit growth somewhere in the 10% to maybe 12% to 14% range. Obviously, some of that dependent on ASP. But Mark or Mark, would you guys like to talk a little bit how architectures might change content growth?
Mark W. Adams: I think that in one sense, depending on the architecture and the operating system efficiency, that can certainly have a swing factor one way or the other, meaning that the density could go down or up depending on the application focus and the usage model. But in the other side of that is when you get to these type of designs, they tend to be more customized and less commoditized. And so they end up being kind of customer-customer design wins, which can protect us from a little bit of the commodity nature.
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: Okay. Well, one last one, if I could. Your CapEx guidance for next year, assuming that does not include Elpida demands, can you maybe bound what you might need to put on top of that in order to keep the Elpida current and then how those assets might even help you going forward in terms of maybe bringing down CapEx spend?
Ronald C. Foster: Alex, we have not released those numbers yet. We will update you when we can.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shawn Webster of Macquarie.
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research: Going back to the supply chain disruption, maybe just kind of the explanation was a little bit vague. Is there -- are you able to parse it out between like what was it a supplier of components or other materials or was there a problem in your own factories or something further down the food chain?
Ronald C. Foster: Yes. I don't want to get too specific, Shawn, but it was a -- there were a number of separate events which accumulated to give us the net effect we had, somewhere internal, somewhere at subcons in the back-end.
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then on the pricing guidance bound for the current quarter, if we exclude mix or assume stable mix, is pricing still down?
Ronald C. Foster: You can probably -- well, first of all, Shawn, you're going to have to be more specific about what designs. But if you look at the spot market, I think Mark covered this in his comments, pricing generally from the end of our quarter to today is up on a line item by line item basis.
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then on the Nanya restructuring still under negotiation, and I understand your -- you don't want to talk a lot about the details yet. But can you tell us what their contribution to your R&D has been in the last couple of quarters, you say?
Mark W. Adams: It's roughly $20 million to $25 million.
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then I guess, finally, are you getting any feedback from your PC OEM customers in terms of overall demand outlook for PCs either in Q1 or Q2, or what catalyst could be if server [indiscernible will be a catalyst and maybe what their overall use on PC growth is next year?
Ronald C. Foster: I think the PC growth projection's in line with what Kipp alluded to earlier. I think they, in the traditional desktop/notebook segment, I think they view the PC growth to be flat plus-or-minus 1% or 2%. But again, I think they -- I think the markets adjust to that. That's already in the market both on the PC OEMs inventory side, as well as the supply side.
Operator: Our question comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: On the manufacturing issues impacting your NAND business in Q1, I know you can't go into a whole lot of detail. But my question is if the disruption is a result in wafer scrappage or was it just a slowdown in output relative to you prior expectations?
Ronald C. Foster: It's a combination of those.
Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then it also seems like, you may have answered this question, but it also seems like you pushed out bit production cost over -- for your 30-nanometer DRAM ramp by about a quarter. I guess, were you also seeing the same manufacturing challenges as you ramp this process? Or was it a different set of issues relative to your NAND technology? Any color there would be great.
Ronald C. Foster: So we had impacts on DRAM and NAND. I would say that our 30-nanometer technology trajectory and ramp has actually seen dramatic improvements as we move through the quarter. So while it was impact on the DRAM side relative to 30-nanometer output, it was not related to overall the technology ramp. We're very pleased with the way that is going.
Kipp A. Bedard: All right. And we'd like to thank everyone for participating on the call today. If you will please bear with me, I need to repeat the Safe Harbor protection language.

Kipp A. Bedard: And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark Durcan. Mark?
D. Mark Durcan: Thanks, Kipp. I'd like to start today with a brief overview of the key developments during the quarter and an update on the proposed Elpida acquisition, followed by a recap of fiscal 2012 and our focus heading into 2013. After that, I'll turn it over to Ron for a financial summary, and we'll close our comments with Mark Adams discussing key developments in our business unit and operations, as well as an update on market condition. Revenue in the quarter was down about 10%, primarily due to a reduction in DRAM bits. You may recall that we had forecast in our previous earnings call that this would be occurring as we transition significant production to more forward gigabit densities. Also impacting this comparison was a significant reduction in inventory for both DRAM and NAND that occurred in our fiscal Q3. Gross margins were pretty flat quarter-over-quarter, with improvements in NAND and NOR and offsetting reductions in DRAM. From a market perspective, NAND flash demand improved during the quarter. And this, coupled with muted industry supply, led to improve ASPs compared to the quarter-to-date estimate we gave you in late June. On the other hand, DRAM market prices deteriorated during the quarter, primarily related to weakness in the PC environment, although our net DRAM ASP, A-S-P, was essentially flat due to mix improvements. NOR revenue remains stable in the quarter, and we're pleased to see NOR gross margins improved by about 5 percentage points, mostly due to cost reductions. Total inventory was down again in fiscal Q4. We're continuing to focus on improving our turns over the next several quarters. In DRAM, 30-nanometer yields are on track, and we should see a nice jump in production and cost improvements over the next few quarters. From a NAND perspective, we had the first full quarter of results following the restructure of our supply and technology agreement with Intel in April. All product coming out of IMFS in Singapore and our Virginia fab now flow to Micron. As a result, we have a much larger base in wafer capacity in our trade NAND trade business, targeting key gross segments including SSDs, smartphones and tablets. Although we would have preferred to be reporting better financial results for fiscal 2012 today, looking back, we had some significant highlights in the year. We achieved increased manufacturing scale and performance as we completed our volume manufacturing ramp of our world-class flash memory facility in Singapore on both 25- and 20-nanometer technology and transitioned Micron's DRAM operations to 30-nanometer DRAM manufacturing. We launched the Hybrid Memory Cube product line, reinforcing our leadership in high performance DRAM technology. We completed the successful implementation of our new global supply chain management system. We achieved a successful outcome in the Rambus antitrust trial. We redefined and expanded our joint venture with Intel. We signed a sponsorship agreement to merge Elpida's operations into Micron and which, upon close, will place Micron as the industry's leading memory pure play and one of the top 5 semiconductor companies in the world. Relative to Elpida, let me elaborate on a few of the items and update you on the timeline to close. The Japanese court and Elpida trustees ran a rigorous and thorough sponsors selection process and determine Micron's sponsorship proposal to be the most attractive alternative. We believe the proposed agreement represents the best solution for Elpida's debtholders, employees, customers and the Japanese semiconductor and electronics industries. For Micron, the deal will provide greater manufacturing and R&D scale, as well as a significant product, customer and cost synergy, all at attractive economics for Micron shareholders. The combined company will be well positioned to grow and thrive, optimizing a potential return for all involved. The financial terms and expected timeline to close have not changed since our announcement in July. On September 11, the U.S. HSR waiting period expired, and depending on the timeline for other government approvals, we still expect to close some time in the first half of 2013. Entering fiscal 2013, we are focused on driving our return to profitability with a continued emphasis on cash flow. We do face some headwinds from the macro environment and from the demand profile in a number of segments. Specific to DRAM, prices are currently soft. While certain amounts of supply has come offline, we still need to see improvement in demand in the market to get things back on track. The upcoming Windows 8 launch and proliferation of DRAM in mobile devices should help get the ball rolling. Although it's hard for us to predict the timing of our recovery, Mark Adams will comment later on this. NAND market prices are currently up quarter-to-date, following the nice ASP recovery over the summer and we don't see any disruptive supply coming online in the near future. We expect strong demand for SSDs and ultrathins in enterprise servers and storage, as well as the proliferation of smartphones and tablets to fuel significant NAND consumption. From an operational standpoint, we continue to drive manufacturing cost reductions and optimize our product mix, focused on the best margin and growth opportunities. We also intend to be very disciplined in our spending profile, both in terms of overhead and CapEx and manage our inventory levels carefully. I'll stop here and turn it over to Ron and Mark before returning for Q&A.
Ronald C. Foster: Thanks, Mark. Our 2012 fiscal year ended on August 30. On our website, we have provided a schedule containing certain key results for the fourth quarter, as well as certain guidance for the next quarter. That material is also presented on a few slides that follow. First, the fiscal 2012, it ended in a net loss of just over $1 billion or $1.04 per share on net sales of $8.2 billion. Fiscal 2011 comparatively showed roughly breakeven net income on sales of $8.8 billion. Total sales for 2012 decreased about 6% compared to the prior year as a result of the generally severe price pressure in the memory industry as a whole. DRAM sales for 2012 reflect a 12% decrease compared to 2011, the product of a 59% increase in DRAM bit sales, offset by a 45% decrease in average selling prices. Bit sales in the premium DRAM sectors increased 62% in 2012 compared to 2011. Trade NAND sales grew 19%, the product of bit sales over 2.5x the 2011 level, offset by a 55% decrease in selling prices. Trade NAND sales were favorably affected by the higher mix of Micron SSDs in 2012, which comprised 14% of trade NAND sales for the year. Sales of NOR products decreased year-over-year in line with the general decline in market demand and the performance of our customer base in particular. On the cost side, DRAM bit cost in 2012 decreased 32% compared to the prior year, roughly consistent with the long-term industry trend. NAND bit cost over the past year decreased 45% compared to the prior year as we leverage our industry-leading process technology. Broadly, annual sales for 2012 were comprised of about 44% NAND, 39% DRAM and 12% NOR. Turning now to the fourth quarter results. We posted a net loss of $243 million or $0.24 per share on net sales of $2 billion. These quarterly results compare to a net loss of $320 million or $0.32 per share on net sales of $2.2 billion for the third quarter. Fourth quarter revenue was sequentially lower in total, as well as for both DRAM and NAND on generally flat pricing for DRAM products and slightly lower pricing for NAND products. Although DRAM pricing was generally down in the fourth quarter, as Mark mentioned, improved mix in our premium segments yielded an overall flat average selling price. Both DRAM and NAND saw lower volumes of bit sales. As a result, when combined with stable bit cost for both DRAM and NAND across the 2 quarters and at better NOR margin performance, consolidated gross margin was fairly stable for the third quarter in a row. Depreciation and amortization in the fourth quarter was $509 million. This decrease, compared to recent historical periods, is due to certain production equipment primarily in the Lehigh and Virginia NAND and 200-millimeter NOR operations that have become fully depreciated. We anticipate depreciation and amortization expense will be approximately $2 billion for fiscal 2013. As a result of the changes to the IM Flash joint venture with Intel that occurred in the third quarter, NAND sales to Intel decreased by half in the fourth quarter, consistent with our previous projections. That volume has now shifted to trade NAND going forward. However, trade NAND bit volume growth for Q4, although consistent with our projection, did not reflect the magnitude of this shift for 2 reasons. First, onetime WIP sales to Intel, which were part of the IM Flash transaction, masked the normal Q3 to Q4 growth rate. And second, some production volume went back into WIP as we refilled the manufacturing pipeline with Micron trade products, so you can better ascertain the underlying growth rate by comparing trade bit growth from Q2 to Q4, which grew 78% over that period. A higher volume of SSD sales in the fourth quarter mitigated the decrease in trade NAND selling prices compared to the third quarter. Price decreases for NAND components enabled increased penetration into the client SSD space. Sales of enterprise SSDs were also up nicely albeit on a lower base. Trade NAND selling prices are up a couple percent quarter-to-date, while trade NAND cost per bit is expected to be down a few percent in the first quarter. Trade NAND bit growth is projected to be flat in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter as we transition to new technology nodes. DRAM revenue on the fourth quarter decreased 9% compared to the previous quarter as a result of a 9% decrease in bit sales volume, consistent with our prior guidance, due to a mix shift to lower density specialty DRAM, as well as initially lower yields on our new 4-gig DDR3 RAM. Selling prices for specialty DRAM products improved slightly in the fourth quarter, while prices in the PC sector dropped significantly due to weakness in demand. Quarter-to-date, selling prices are down on the high teens when compared to the Q4 average. DRAM cost per bit declined slightly quarter-to-quarter, and we are forecasting bit cost for DRAM in the first quarter to be down in the high single-digit range as we continue to transition to our 4-gig DDR3 product. This transition is also driving bit production up low- to mid-teens in the first quarter. NOR sales increased slightly in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter and represented 12% of total revenue for Q4. NOR revenue in the first quarter is expected to be in the same range as the fourth quarter. We anticipate NOR cost reductions will continue to outpace selling price reductions in the first quarter. Turning now to business units. The NAND Solutions Group revenue declined from the third quarter due to the onetime impact of selling back-end inventory to Intel during the third quarter that I mentioned earlier. Trade NAND sales and NSG were up in the fourth quarter on increased volume and stable average selling prices. NSG was able to achieve positive operating income from the third quarter level on improved product mix sold in the fourth quarter, including a 67% increase in bits sold in SSD form, as well as lower cost base sales to Intel. Operating income from the DRAM Solutions Group in the fourth quarter primarily reflects the lower DRAM revenue trends I commented on earlier. DSG sales into the personal system sector decreased as we move volumes into higher-margin areas, notably networking, as pricing in the personal systems came under additional pricing pressure, particularly in the latter part of our fourth quarter. DRAM sales into the personal systems market were just 14% of total sales in our fourth quarter. Our Wireless Solutions Group performance continues to reflect weakness of the feature phone market segment and our customer group, in particular. Revenue declined for the third quarter, primarily due to lower NAND sales, as we transitioned to new products and configuration and as customers worked through existing inventory. Wireless DRAM and NAND declined ahead of product transitions, while wireless NOR sales remain steady quarter-to-quarter. The Embedded Solutions Group results continue to reflect growth, particularly in the automotive and industrial sectors. In fact, in the fourth quarter, ESG reported its highest revenue levels since the establishment of our business unit. The revenue growth came from the broad strength across the technology portfolio as NOR, NAND and DRAM revenue increased from the third quarter. In addition to the top line growth, ESG operating income strengthened as the fourth quarter results included better cost performance than the previous quarter and improved factory utilization. In operating expenses, SG&A expense in the fourth quarter was slightly below our projected range as a result of lower costs associated with pending legal matters and lower personnel costs from our variable pay plans. We expect SG&A expense to be between $135 million and $145 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Fourth quarter expense for R&D was right at the high end of our guided range. These expenses vary primarily due to the volume of development wafers processed and the timing of the product quals. R&D expense in the first quarter is expected to be between $220 million and $230 million. The company generated $450 million in cash flow from operating activities in the fourth quarter. Comparing operating cash flows in the third quarter to the fourth quarter, the IM Flash restructure transaction had a favorable impact on Q3 from the $300 million deposit received from Intel in the third quarter, while the fourth quarter operating cash flow was negatively impacted by $45 million of product sales, invoices charged to that deposit. We ended the fiscal year with a cash and investments balance of $2.9 billion. This balance increased $718 million compared to the previous yearend, as we generate $2.1 billion of cash from operations, raised $1.5 billion net new financing and spent $1.9 billion in capital expenditures. Inventory declined $82 million quarter-to-quarter, where finished goods reductions more than offset the WIP increase related to refilling the back-end pipeline after the Intel transaction. We expect expenditures from property plant and equipment for fiscal 2013 to be between $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion, slightly weighted toward the earlier part of the fiscal year. Now I'll turn it over to Mark Adams for his comments. Mark?
Mark W. Adams: Thanks, Ron. Today, I'm going to walk through some of our fourth quarter operational highlights, as well as discuss the current market dynamics in memory business. Our NAND Solutions Group recovered from a weak ASP environment in the beginning of the quarter. If you recall, ASPs were down mid-teens this quarter-to-date during the first few weeks of our Q4. Prices recovered during the quarter, and the trade NAND business ended up with slight revenue growth and stable gross margins. In addition, finished goods inventory declined quarter-over-quarter. Micron SSD revenue was up 33% in the quarter with unit shipments up over 50%. We're seeing steady growth of our client SSDs at key OEM partners and continued growth of Crucial blended SSD drives in the channel. Where other channel competitors have struggled to generate a profit, Crucial continues to drive solid financial performance. We are now shipping client SSDs to 5 of the top OEMs in the world and plans to grow our share in the coming year. Client SSD revenue was up close to 30% in Q4. For fiscal year '12, unit shipments more than doubled. Also, part of our growing client portfolio is our new mSATA SSD, which was selected as Best of Show Award winner at this year's Flash Memory Summit as the Most Innovative Flash Consumer Application. On the enterprise side, our SATA drives, the P300 and P400e, continue to be the lead drives for us this quarter in terms of shipments. We also maintained steady progress in qualifying our PCIe drives with leading OEM customers and are now gaining traction to our distribution channels as well. In Q4, Enterprise SSD revenue was up over 50% albeit off of a relatively low base. We're gearing up for some new products this fall, including our enterprise grade SATA drive and our first SAS drive. Both drives are involved in casing now with OEMs. Unique features we provide with these new products showcase our silicon to system strategy including the firmware and hardware management schemes that are only available from a Micron-integrated SSD. Another example of our growing system capability is the acquisition of Virtensys this fiscal year, which had provided Micron with a virtualized appliance. In combination with our P320 PCIe cards, it provides much more storage in the appliance versus mobile server storage, and when we hook these up via PCIe interconnects, you can share the storage across an enterprise environment. We've also made significant strides in the quarter and in the fiscal year with our internal controller development. Our controller strategy is really 2-pronged, using both internal and externally-designed controllers. We're focused at the high end of our system solution for our internally design controllers. However, our approach is modularized and can be scaled down to the lower-end client systems over time. On a NAND technology operation front, we continue to be pleased with 20-nanometer ramp and expect production crossover in the first half of calendar year 2013. MLC represented about 75% to 80% of our wafer production in Q4, with SLC and TLC essentially splitting the remainder. Although fiscal Q1 will only see a small reduction in trade NAND cost per bit, we expect to average down mid to high-single digits over the next several quarters, mostly related to the 20-nanometer execution. As I mentioned earlier, following a tough first half of the calendar year, NAND prices started to recover over the summer, and we have seen continued improvements in market prices subsequent to our quarter end. In terms of NAND inventory, we see the channel balanced about 3 weeks. We are excited about the drivers for NAND, including SSDs, tablets and smartphones and believe the industry bit demand compounded over annually 50% [ph] from 2012 through 2016. In 2013, NSG bit supply forecast are up in the low 50% [ph] range, well below historical levels. We continue to see balance between our current capacity and serving our customer needs. Our DRAM Solutions Group achieved record shipments in networking, storage, graphics and consumer segments this quarter. On the server side, we increased market share with existing customers and won [ph] critical qualification slot that our new customers are [ph] in the high-growth data center markets. We did, however, see some price pressure in the server market as OEMs compete for this growth-oriented data center business. Nonetheless, this server-growing market segment share is helping to drive DRAM bit demand over 50% year-over-year. The networking segment had another strong quarter, exceeding targets for revenue, bit growth and gross margin. In terms of demand in the segment, LTE adoption is progressing well. While the Americas and Japan have strong investments in the infrastructure, so does -- China will continue to grow despite some weakness showing in the European market segments. During Q4, we have seen softness in PC demand, although we were able -- still able to maintain minimal ASP declines in the quarter. That being said, we are seeing price weakness in Q1 and see short-term challenges with channel inventory overhang and OEM customers remaining generally cautious. The demand catalyst for improvement in the PC DRAM segment include the upcoming Windows 8 launch, with both Intel and ARM-based products expected in key OEMs, in particular, with the Ultrathin category. From a technology perspective, our 30-nanometer process nodes saw volume ramp in fiscal Q4 with qualifications across the broad customer base. The timing of our 4-gigabyte transition actually limited our output in fiscal Q4, but we expect to catch up this quarter, which, coupled, with the 30-nanometer technologies, providing significant bit growth and cost reductions. Another key aspect of our cost per bit and output improvement over the next couple of quarters is Inotera's execution. In fiscal Q4, they took steps to remove a production bottleneck during what was a slow demand period. Moving forward, the throughput and percentage of wafers on leading-edge technologies from Inotera will improve. In aggregate, we expect crossover output on 30-nanometer in the current quarter, putting us in a much stronger competitive position. We are also progressing with a 30-nanometer design strength [ph] , which will give us additional cost reductions over the next couple of quarters. Our 20-nanometer process node will commence in calendar year 2013. All in all, we see quarterly cost per bit reductions averaging mid- to high-single digits over the next several quarters. DRAM market prices were generally stable coming into the quarter, although things began to weaken in July and we're seeing that trend continue as we head into fiscal year 2013. In terms of DRAM inventory, we believe that the channel is currently running about 6 to 8 weeks on average. Some of the short term weakness in PC DRAM seem attributable to a pause prior to the Windows 8 launch. We anticipate things will improve with the new OS and in combination with Ultrathin form factors, although timing is difficult to predict. Outside of PC, we're generally pleased with DRAM demand, with several segments driving bit demand well over 40% year-over-year. That said, continued mild or even lower industry supply bit growth might be the required catalyst to get DRAM ASPs back to profitable levels in the future. Current industry bit forecasts are high 20s -- or 20% for 2012 and similar for 2013 although there's no certain possibility of further supply or CapEx cuts in the industry given current ASP weakness. Revenues in our Wireless Solutions Group declined with both DRAM and NAND as we continued [ph] to work on aligning our product portfolios to customer demand. NOR sales stabilized and were essentially flat quarter-over-quarter. As we rebuild our wireless business, we remain focused on profitability. Despite the top line revenue decline, we see better operating performance in WSG, which will be our focus when we prepare for a combination with Elpida's wireless business. Fiscal Q4 saw the introduction and rapid growth with the smartphone open market in China. This is expected to represent the majority of the rapidly growing Chinese smartphone market, which is forecasted to grow from 50 units -- 50 million units in 2011 to 600 million units in 2014 due to the rapid transition from feature phones to smartphones. During fiscal Q4, this emerging market adversely affected our wireless revenue due to abrupt NAND MCP density changes. However, in the long run, we anticipate this modest growth to be a huge opportunity for Micron due to our future portfolio alignment. One example is the ramp-up of our 4-gigabit low-power DDR2 mobile DRAM, which is growing in present significantly in a portion of the market. We're also excited to announce the official qualification of our 1-gigabit phase change memory-based MCP product with 2 key mobile customers. We expect volume shipments to commence in fiscal 2013. I also want to take this opportunity to welcome Mike Rayfield, who recently joined Micron as our new Vice President of the Wireless Solutions Group. Mike has an impressive background in the wireless business. I know he is excited to hit the ground running and help position this segment for growth and profitability in the future. Our Embedded Solutions Group had another solid performance with record revenue in gross margins driven by strong quarter-over-quarter shipment growth in DRAM, NAND and NOR and across all regions outside of Europe. We have strong design wins across all technologies and clearly strengthened the networking in automotive sectors during the second half of the year. In automotive, where we are now ramping the MMC products for the segment, which is expected to drive significant revenue in fiscal 2013. We've also completed qualification on over 150 platforms at 60-chipset partners during the last year. These qualifications span all segments with particular strength in consumer networking, ensuring that Micron embedded memory solutions were supported and pre-validated with chipset solutions to enable our customers fastest time in the market. We are leading the NOR industry from a manufacturing and technology perspective with 45-nanometer now ramping in mass volume on 200 millimeter and then the recent introduction of 45-nanometer, 300-millimeter NOR in our Virginia fab. Moving into 2013, we will continue to focus on growing our share in key embedded segments leveraging our product portfolio, technology leadership and manufacturing scale. Our operational performance in fiscal 2013 is to continue the deployment of advanced technology, which I described earlier in the business units discussion, as well as improved cost efficiency in our fabs, optimize our inventory and enhance supply chain management. Our broad product portfolio extending scale and global manufacturing presence requires a greater focus on supply chain management. The same goes for inventory management. We are tasking our business units and our sales teams to increase turns and quarterly sales linearity for high-volume products, while we're also ensuring we have the right levels of strategic inventory for premium margin-specific products. While we have experienced ultimate market conditions over the last 12 months, we are optimistic that we can see improved money market looking out over the next 12 months. While DRAM prices have indeed weakened, we have seen a nice recovery in NAND ASPs and our overall NAND demand while we're benefiting from slower industry supply. Our NOR margins improved in Q4 and this business continues to generate substantial free cash flow. We remain focused on optimizing our product portfolio, as well as leveraging our technology leadership and manufacturing efficiency to enhance our financial performance in 2013. Now I'll turn it back -- the call back over to Kipp.
Kipp A. Bedard: Thank you, Mark. We will now like to take questions from callers. [Operator Instructions]
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of James Schneider from Goldman Sachs.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I guess, first of all, on the NAND side, I think you referred to some industry bit growth estimates for 2013 in the low 50% range. I was wondering, based on what you see today, do you think we're going to end up for the industry on the high or low end side of that? And where do you expect Micron to come in, in terms of that industry bit growth, higher or lower?
D. Mark Durcan: I think the answer to your question is probably both on the low end, both the industry and Micron.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, fair enough. And then could you maybe talk about in the Wireless Solutions Group what are the steps you're going to take to start turning around the profitability in that segment? I think you obviously referred to improving gross margins in the NOR Flash space. But can you talk to maybe some of the actions you might look to take, either operationally or in terms of pulling apart portfolio there?
D. Mark Durcan: Sure. I think it's important to note that the business -- our wireless business has evolved from both the acquisition of Numonyx and kind of where this segment was. And then we had a pretty high heavily concentrated business in the feature phone market. We're -- we've been moving our product development efforts, as well as product roadmaps towards the smartphone piece of the business and our advancement in terms of low-power DRAM will allow us to get more aligned with the broader demand cycles in the mobile phone market. So I think from a product perspective, we're well aligned going forward. We also have, in taking a look at our spending across NAND, DRAM and NOR, to make sure we're focused on these future products and making some test choices on some of the existing or historical legacy products that have not generated profit. So between the expenditure side and some product alignment and, of course, our new leadership, we feel pretty good about the business going forward.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: That's great. And the last question for me will be, I think you gave a number in terms of the SSD sales for fiscal '12. Do you care to make any kind of guess about what that number could be like on a -- or your basis for 2013?
D. Mark Durcan: You know us, James, we try not to predict anything like that or forecast it, but nice try.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Barclays.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I guess first one on the DRAM side, can you talk about what you're seeing there in terms of utilization rate, particularly from the Tier 2 guys? Are you starting to see them ratchet back or they're still lingering?
D. Mark Durcan: Really, we just read the same stuff in the press that you guys do, and it's hard for us to comment beyond that sort of speculation.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. I guess, thinking a little bit longer term, can you share with us what the mix was, PC, server mobility, et cetera, in August? And where you think that could move to 12 months from now and how we should think about the implications to gross margins for that business?
D. Mark Durcan: Sure. On a revenue basis, we were exposed to the personal systems by about 15%. This is of total revenues, had a pretty strong server business, low double digits; networking and storage, mid-teens; mobile, low-double digits; and then AIMM was around 10%.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And care to talk about where you see that going 12 years -- 12 months from now?
D. Mark Durcan: Can I just say just going to repeat my answer from the last question? It's really hard, especially we're talking revenues. You have to also predict not only your growth rate in bits, but also what ASPs are going to be doing, and that's just pretty difficult to determine.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Sure, very fair. And then last question for me on the NAND side. Can you walk through the roadmap there in 20-nanometer? When we should start to see -- you talked about, I guess, mid-to-high cost down each quarter. Will that commence in calendar Q1, Q2? How should we think about that?
D. Mark Durcan: Go ahead, Mark.
Mark W. Adams: I think the answer is we're really focused on hitting more of the production crossover towards the end of the first half of 2013. So then you'll see some of that costs flow through to our NAND costs. So today, we're shipping the product but expect to continued increased volumes that allow us to realize big cost savings.
D. Mark Durcan: If I can add, I can just refer you as well to your guidance sheet. You can see there for Q1 '13, we're suggesting down a few percent in NAND and then a more aggressive cost down over the next few quarters after that.
Operator: And we also have a question from the line of Daniel Amir from Lazard.
Daniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Can you a bit expand how you see kind of the PC market playing out in the next year given Windows 8, Ultrabooks, some of the change that you've done also to the DRAM franchise? And then I have one follow-up.
Mark W. Adams: Well, I think we commented earlier that, currently, we're in a soft PC DRAM market condition, and we do have some belief that between Windows 8 and a further enhanced delivery of ultrathin products from across the OEM base, can infuse some higher demand signals. It's hard to call. It doesn't seem like it's going to be in the real short term, but we think over the fiscal year, we see some balance there in terms of the markets, some recovery in the PC space. But that's really those 2 demand drivers offset, obviously, by smartphone and tablet growth and how that impacts the overall long-term piece of the business.
Daniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then in terms of -- how should we look at kind of the best guess would be on cost-downs in the DRAM space here in the next year? I don't know how much you want to comment on potential Elpida, but maybe without Elpida.
D. Mark Durcan: We're looking at around 30% to 40% on DRAM.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Steven Chin from UBS.
Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: First one I had relates to your mobile DRAM products. I know it's still a relatively modest business for you currently. But referring from your perspective, what was the current average content for mobile DRAM in the smartphones that you guys have exposure to? And also, is your ability to produce mobile DRAM, is that going to be the -- is it the limiter to how big you guys can grow your MCP business?
D. Mark Durcan: Sure. I can start with the first part of that with the raw data, then maybe Mark can jump in with some of the spots around how the market's set a bit. Today, on average of all handsets, you're looking at about 315 megabytes per phone, average handset and about 3.5 gigabytes of NAND. In the smartphone segment itself, you're currently looking at smartphones in about the total 600, low 700 megabytes per handset and more in the low-30s to 40 -- low-30s gigabytes in NAND in the smartphone segment. The average megabytes per handset next year by third-party analysts are expected to grow again over 100% and NAND up around 50%.
Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, perfect. And just looking at your solid-state drive business. Obviously, you do have a number of different products that are helping to expand portfolio, both on the client side and enterprise side. Care to take any guesses then as to what kind of margin profile the overall business will look like in a years' time, just given the different enterprise pieces, whether it's PCIe or the flash drive?
D. Mark Durcan: You guys are really making it easy for me to answer. I keep saying, sorry, too hard to predict.
Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then just one last question. In terms of capital equipment reuse, can you remind us, given the latest generation of NAND, the lithography equipment that you have, what would be the smallest node that it can be reused on for DRAM?
D. Mark Durcan: This is Mark. There's really a lot of fungibility and we have really state-of-the-art lithography equipment in all our manufacturing fabs. Depending on the manufacturing technology we use, that equipment is generally fungible down to 15 nanometers on either technology.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of David Wong from Wells Fargo.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: In terms of your technology, you were talking about NAND transitions down to 20 nanometers. What's your visibility at the moment for future NAND transitions? And when do you expect to have to have EUV to keep progressing?
D. Mark Durcan: Well, we -- as I just mentioned, David, we can take the existing immersion -- high NA capacity on -- down to the 15-nanometer range. Obviously, we'd love to have a low-cost EUV solution available. If the manufacturing costs were there today, we'd use it today, but we can continue to migrate our technology without it, and we just continue to monitor that. We'll be adopters as soon as we see the return.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Right. And on Elpida, if I understand correctly, in addition to the regulatory agreement, you still need a final decision from the court for the deal to progress under the negotiated term. Is that correct? And if so, is there a deadline for when the court will make that determination?
D. Mark Durcan: We still see this deal closing the first half of 2013, and we see that the -- from our perspective, the bottleneck in that process is likely to be the regulatory approval. The court process will run its course, and we think that the regulatory approval will overlap or extend beyond the end of that process.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Goodman from the CLSA.
Ryan Goodman - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division: I have a question on the DRAM side of things. In the past, you've talked about specialty DRAM prices as trailing your commodity trends with lower highs and then higher loads, so sort of a smoother trend over time. But then if we look back over the past year, there really wasn't that boost early in the year in prices when commodity was doing well. Last quarter, it sounds like you've kind of tracked in line with flattish trends and then looking ahead, you're talking about down in the high teens. So I guess, how should we think about this business going forward relative -- how it will trend relative to the commodity trends?
Mark W. Adams: Well, I think that certainly there are certain segments that are experiencing significant growth but there's also new dynamics going on in the market segment, and I'm thinking specifically about server where we've seen tremendous application growth, but also on the low end of that segment, some level of commoditization with generic platforms and non-branded solutions where, even in the likes of Google, now being one of the largest server manufacturers in the world. So I think we're seeing pieces -- parts of that segment under some price pressure due to commoditization of it. But overall, we remain very bullish about the server business and I think it will be continue to behave as such. And the other side of that equation is that there wasn't really a big rebound as you might have suggested in the first half of the year. We didn't see that. It might have slowed, but it still -- DRAM didn't really have a recovery in such that it's just got a longer, prolonged pricing environment, especially the lag and now kind of in line with where it normally is.
Ryan Goodman - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division: Okay. And then just a question on the NAND side of things. We've seen a kind of a reshuffling in the competitive landscape, at least on the custom embedded side of things where -- with some of the larger buyers out there have shifted their supplier base. Just curious what you guys are seeing in terms of how that impacted the opportunities you have? Has this opened up anything? Or are you seeing increased competition on fronts where you haven't in the past?
D. Mark Durcan: Really, Ryan, we haven't seen much of a change. The opportunities to increase our market share are available to us from various customers. And as we -- as Mark noted, we're excited to get our hands on additional trade NAND bits that we can go service these guys in a higher manner.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman from RBC Capital Market.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Mark, you made a mention that you guys have the fungibility on the equipment front to go to lower nodes. How about transitioning from DRAM to NAND? And when I look at what's happening in the marketplace, it sounds like the NAND market is clearly in better space shape than the DRAM market, but yet your output is increasing fastest on the DRAM side. How do we reconcile that?
D. Mark Durcan: Well, Doug, I think that flexibility is definitely there and that's certainly something we have the ability to do as we migrate to future nodes. The opportunity to take DRAM capacity and move it to NAND is there. It's cost effective and efficient. It's not something you want to do with high frequency, but it is something you can do in Japan. Roadmaps in technology node transitions to efficiently take DRAM capacity and migrate it to NAND. And for that matter, it's the opposite of your thesis, but you can do it the other way around as well.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I guess my question is, really looking at next quarter, you're getting production up in DRAM faster in bit terms than your NAND side and I'm trying to understand why you're doing -- why you wouldn't have inverted that this quarter, given the condition in the marketplace.
D. Mark Durcan: Simple answer, Doug, it's just the timing of the strengths. We've got a real nice, steep ramp here on 30-nanometer DRAM in Q1. And our real steep ramp in NAND bits going to 20-nanometer really happened in Q2 and 3.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And I guess as sort of a follow-up, how should we think about the status of your inventory? And whether you -- inventory did come down a little bit this quarter. Is that the right level of inventory? And how should we think about your ability to model inventory for the next year, so to speak? Is there an opportunity to run your factories a little leaner so that there's higher turns? How should we think about that?
Mark W. Adams: Doug, as I commented in my opening discussion, we will continue to look at inventory. Over the last couple of quarters, I think the team has done a pretty good of job on that front. And then we also, as we take a look at some of these more system-level solutions, enterprise is a steeper example. It's -- when we take capacity from just selling raw components to building solutions-oriented products, it might limit some of the future reduction potential. But we will continue to look at it, and we feel pretty confident we are putting the right controls in place to make sure inventory stays at the appropriate level for the business.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And my last question for you, can you guys give us an update on new technologies? I mean, we talked at the last Analyst Day about a whole laundry list of potential candidates for the next generation technology. Where do we stand on that and mainly timeframe?
D. Mark Durcan: Well, we continue to make good progress on a number of different technologies targeted at really slightly different applications. Obviously, we're in volume manufacturing now on phase change. So I don't know if you count that as an emerging memory anymore because we really don't -- we count it as here today and going into volume applications in 2013. But beyond that, some of the ROE RAM technologies and other more advanced next-generation memories, we're making good progress on them. I don't see any of them having a significant impact in 2013 or really in 2014 with the possible exception of some volume on vertical NAND technologies, if you include those in that bucket.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Alex Gauna from JMP Securities.
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: If I heard you right, you talked about what mobile DRAM in and being down in the mobile category. And I was wondering, is that a phenomenon of your customers working down inventory during what should otherwise be seasonal strength? Is it ASPs? Or is it simply your customer mix and maybe not having the best share positioning as we go into the holiday season?
Mark W. Adams: I think it's really the latter area. We're working ourselves through some customer concentration, customer mix issues that don't really reflect the larger in potential as we transition. But that's what's causing some of the impact to the financials.
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: How long would it take you to maybe realign that customer concentration out? Can you -- what kind of window should we look forward to?
Mark W. Adams: I would just say this, without trying to predict too much in the future, Alex, I think that we've been working on this for some time. And remember, some of the product technology that we have that goes in that space, the value of commodity line of the wireless space, we can also use in other segments, namely embedded. So as we're focusing our customer engagement development efforts on some of the better pieces of the wireless business, we're able to use some of that capacity and drive ESG, for example, to higher -- their highest quarter since they've been formed as a BU. So I don't want to predict the future. I will just say that this is a known process that we're going through in the company that obviously, hasn't yet hit the financials but we're pretty encouraged by things like low-power DRAM and our 30-nanometer nodes and the uptick that we've seen in wireless, in addition to our longer-term prospects of a combined Micron and Elpida wireless business.
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then if I could ask, SSD seems to be performing pretty well but the DRAM, as it pertains to the PC industry, is struggling. How can you reconcile that? Is the SSD business experiencing some of the similar weakness in DRAM? Or has your share gain been so great that it masks it?
Mark W. Adams: I think when you look at SSDs, the client SSD business is coming from such a lower penetration rate that the -- uptick giving more pricing add and the value consumers are placing on it continues to improve. And the core DRAM growth, obviously, doesn't in line with the same traffic, so it's kind of in a much larger share of the platform.
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: Okay. One more, if I could. You mentioned Windows 8 being a catalyst eventually. It sounds like you've not yet seen some much of the boost. Can you talk about your expectations around the build cycle there and maybe about average density as it pertains to now that we have Windows RT and we have Windows X86?
D. Mark Durcan: We believe that the builds have largely taken place. And as Mark mentioned in his commentary, PC OEMs are being extremely conservative. They don't want to have a high risk of inventory obsolescence. And in terms of the second part of your question, remind me again?
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: I guess I was wondering about what this does to average density, especially now that we've got to deal with the factor of the Windows RT versions out there.
D. Mark Durcan: Yes, let me answer it maybe 2 ways. If you go on to a lot of the online website sales organizations for the various large OEMs, you're seeing a fairly large concentration now at 6 and 8 gigabytes. That being said, when you look at the third-party data, they're only suggesting about a 20% to 25% bit growth from the PC area for next year.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Dean Grumlose from Stifel, Nicolaus.
Dean Grumlose - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: This is Dean Grumlose calling in for Kevin Cassidy. I have a question and a follow-up. As we head into next fiscal year, can you comment on your expected change in the NAND Flash wafer output?
D. Mark Durcan: We don't expect a large change in the number of wafers currently.
Dean Grumlose - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And as a follow-up, do you have a projection on how your mix of SLC versus MLC and TLC may change, heading into next quarter?
D. Mark Durcan: It won't change all that much from where we are today. We're running basically high 70% MLC and the balance is split pretty evenly between SLC and TLC.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer from Piper Jaffray.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: I was just wondering, Mark, can you give us some color in terms of the past quarter, in terms of how the sequential ASP trends were between the 2 SSD segments? And how much more value can you add to strengthen the ASP in that segment? And I have a follow-up.
Mark W. Adams: Sure. Well, I think, as the track of cost per gigabytes and ASPs have gone throughout our 2012 year, the demand cycle for client SSDs went up significantly, and that's what's showing up in our financials as far as the client SSD performance. When I look at how much more value is there, I think the value around that is driven by the industry's ability to remain competitive on the ASP front to drive a good level of demand on the longer term PC builds. I think that seems to be in a pretty good place today. So I think there's -- with increased or newer ability to drive cost down over the next 6 to 12 months, we would anticipate a continued demand growth there. On the enterprise side, there's a lot more ability, obviously, to differentiate both in terms of form factor, as well as performance and reliability features, that we think is already in place but will continue to grow as the development -- as we talked about earlier in our controllers and firmware and error correction, those types of things fit into our product portfolio, which will again allow us to drive more differentiation and value.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Follow-up on this. Can you give us some color on the 2013 CapEx between the DRAM, NAND and the NOR segment? And does it include Elpida at this point of time? Or should we model something going to be incrementally for Elpida once the acquisition gets closed?
D. Mark Durcan: Yes. So I think in terms of NAND and DRAM, roughly balanced. And that number that we floated out there, $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion, we continue to work on that. And as we really tune our investment for 2013, just on what's strictly needed to drive particular product introductions and efficiency in our technology implementation. Elpida is not included in that number. Obviously, depending on when we close Elpida, the numbers will change. But I think you should expect that to the extent we are investing in Elpida, we'll be trading those opportunities off against internal opportunities to make sure that we'll put the capital in the highest return on investment.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: If I could just add one quick follow-up. Can you just characterize how much of it was supply cost in the DRAM between the first half of this year and the second half of this year?
D. Mark Durcan: Probably need to ask the people who actually made the cut, to be honest with it.

Mark?
D. Mark Durcan: Thanks, Kipp. I'd like to start today by giving a brief overview of the quarter, including some color on where we performed well and where we need to improve our execution. After some thoughtful discussion on company strategy, I'll turn it over to Ron for financial summary, and we'll close our preliminary comments with Mark Adams providing an update on the market conditions and key developments in our business units. Revenue in the quarter was -- obviously exceeded expectations as a result of solid manufacturing performance and good work on inventory improvement by our business units and sales force. There is yet room for improvement on inventory management, but it was certainly gratifying to see the results this quarter. And with the closing of the Intel debut restructuring, we expect benefit from an ongoing structural improvement in our NAND inventory turns. In the quarter, we completed the rollout of a new supply-chain management infrastructure and though there were a few inevitable bumps along the way, the process is complete and we look forward to building from here to new levels of customer service and responsiveness. The 30-nanometer DRAM yield ramp picked up steam during the quarter in all 3 DRAM manufacturing facilities, and is now focused predominantly on higher-density 4-gigabit DRAM products. The technology team made solid progress on a number of new technology nodes including NAND, DRAM, NOR, PCM and some emerging memory part types. The DRAM market found its footing during the quarter and while NAND market softened significantly, since quarter end we've seen its improved stability here also. Mark Adams and Ron Foster will comment more on all these areas. Given the current memory industry climate and changes here over the last 4 months, I'd like to spend a few minutes sharing some thoughts on the opportunities currently presenting themselves to Micron and our path forward. Two weeks ago, I marked my 25th anniversary at Micron. When I started, we had one 5-inch wafer fabs and goats grazing out the front. I've clearly seen many changes in the company, as well as in the competitive landscape of our industry. One constant has been Micron emerging from tumultuous times as not only a survivor, but a stronger company. While the memory markets are obviously somewhat soft currently, we believe they are bottoming and we will have the wind more to our backs moving into the second half of the year. We've taken steps over the years to broaden our product portfolio, improve our cost competitiveness, strengthen our technology position and capitalize on the right strategic opportunities when they arise. It is my intent to continue to move in this direction. My focus is on building an operating and financial model that can deliver sustainable free cash flow and dependable ROI. There are many levers to pull in order to achieve these goals. As always technology, capital efficiency, product differentiation, close customer engagement, effective sales channels, timely and low-cost investment and manufacturing efficiency and effectiveness are key to optimizing our results. In addition, however, being cognizant of and reacting appropriately to memory industry supply and demand dynamics is important to achieving this result. There's currently considerable interest, of course, in whether Micron will consummate the purchase of Elpida, which represents 15% to 20% of the DRAM industry capacity. As most of you are aware, we announced previously that we were selected to negotiate exclusively to become the sponsor for Elpida in the bankruptcy process. We are in a unique strategic and financial position to take a look at this opportunity and are interested in pursuing it, if it can be done under the right terms and conditions. In my mind, these include making sure we do not unnecessarily dilute our equity nor incur excessive interest-bearing debt that might overly hamper our flexibility moving forward. A deal with Elpida in this context should enhance our scale and operating expense efficiency. Elpida also has a strong product portfolio, leading-edge technology, strong IP and talented workforce. I think our track record of successful M&A transactions, which by the way includes avoiding deals which do not fit financially and strategically, speaks for itself. If a deal cannot be done on terms that are acceptable to us, I want to emphasize that we're also comfortable with our organic opportunities. Our customer base is fantastic and almost all are looking to do more business with Micron. Let me give you a couple of examples of other things you can expect we'll be doing outside of the effective ongoing management of the existing core business. On the product and technology front, 2 key opportunities include our Hybrid Memory Cube and enterprise SSD products. These premium products are pushing Micron further up the value chain with our customers and will help improve our margin structure over the long term. Key to success in these and other more system-oriented memory solutions we are pursuing are the right partnerships up and down the value chain, including those with suppliers, customers and service providers. We will continue to forge close relationships with other parties to ensure that Micron solutions are the most widely available, flexibly configured and most value-add for our customers and the end markets. While we're building core competencies internally to support these initiatives, I believe we can best enhance return for our shareholders by partnering closely with industry leaders in adjacent spaces to optimally leverage our individual strengths. We've got a good history of success in this area and existing partnerships to continue to evolve and new ones to emerge. Mark Adams will cover a few highlights on some previously announced system products during his market discussion later on. On the cost and capital efficiency front, we recently took the tough but necessary steps to terminate our Transform Solar joint venture. While we felt like our technology was strong, the marketplace dynamics did not support ongoing and potential future capital investments which would have been required in order to move the business forward. We will continue to scrutinize all of our businesses to ensure we're focused on the right opportunities and managing our capital resources efficiently. While I won't rule out future diversification in the product -- in the new product areas where we bring significant core competencies to bear, right now we have meaningful opportunities to differentiate and grow in memory and memory systems markets, so you should expect our investment focus to be there. I'll stop here and turn it over to Ron and Mark before turning for Q&A.
Ronald C. Foster: Thanks, Mark. The company's third quarter fiscal 2012 ended on May 31. As usual, we provided a schedule containing certain key results for the quarter as well as certain guidance for the next quarter. That material is presented on the few slides that follow, as well as on our website. The third quarter results posted a net loss of $320 million or $0.32 per share on net sales of $2.2 billion. The higher revenue in the third quarter came primarily from higher DRAM sales volume. Consolidated gross margin was relatively flat compared to the previous quarter, reflecting improved margins on sales of DRAM products, offset by lower margins on NAND. Micron entered into a settlement agreement with a customer after our second quarter earnings release, but before the filing of the quarterly report 10-Q with the SEC. As a result, a $58 million accrual was pushed back into the second quarter results as a charge against DRAM and DSG revenue, and was reflected in the Q2 10-Q filing. This accrual is also reflected in the second quarter results presented today. The cash payment to the customer occurred in the third quarter. Inotera continues to improve both production output, as well as yields. Our share of Inotera's results reflects this improvement, although there's still a net loss in the third quarter of $38 million. In the second quarter, we entered into a short-term loan to Inotera for $133 million. In the third quarter, Inotera repaid the loan and Micron made an equity investment of $170 million, increasing our ownership interest from 30% to 40%. This entitles us to an increased share of 30-nanometer node output in the future. As Mark mentioned during the third quarter, the Board of Directors of Transform, a development stage joint venture in which we have a 50% ownership interest, announced the planned to discontinue operations and liquidate the company. As a result, Micron recognized a charge of $69 million in the third quarter and the equity method investment balance was reduced to 0. Micron leases certain fabrication and other facilities to Transform, which we expect to be terminated and the facilities reverted back to Micron. Depreciation and amortization decreased in the third quarter to $546 million and certain production equipment, primarily in the Lehigh and Virginia NAND, and 200-millimeter NOR operations have become fully depreciated. We anticipate a further reduction in the fourth quarter depreciation in the $515 million to $520 million range. The income tax benefit in the third quarter reflects a $42 million benefit from the favorable resolution of an uncertain tax position in a non-U.S. jurisdiction that arose over several previous years. The original amount of accrual came through the Numonyx acquisition, where we had an indemnification for exposure prior to the acquisition date. As I mentioned last quarter, we restructured our IM Flash joint venture with Intel during the third quarter. As a result, Micron acquired Intel's 18% ownership interest in the IM Flash operation in Singapore and purchased from the IM Flash entity its production assets in the Micron fab in Virginia and the associate lease of a portion of that facility was terminated. Total consideration for these purchases was approximately $600 million. Micron recognized a $17 million loss in the third quarter associated with the termination of the Virginia lease. Intel made a cash deposit with Micron of $300 million, which will be applied to Intel's future purchases under a new supply agreement. In addition, Intel loaned to Micron $65 million, due in installments over a 2-year term. The existing supplier arrangement through IMFT remains intact, and Intel will continue to purchase their 49% of the output from the Lehigh, Utah operation, while Micron owns 100% of the production output from the NAND operations in Singapore and Virginia. Beginning in the fourth quarter, Micron will take approximately half of the volume of this previously sold to Intel at prices approximating cost. A portion of this volume will be sold from Micron to Intel under a new supply agreement at a markup above cost. Going forward, these sales to Intel under the new supply agreement will be reported as trade NAND sales in our financial results. As a result of changes in our partnering arrangement, sales to Intel are now recognized upon completion of wafer fabrication rather than after back-end assembly and tests are completed under the previous arrangement. $97 million of back-end inventories associated with Intel's supply chain was sold to Intel in the third quarter, generating a onetime increase in NAND sales revenue and reducing WIP inventories by the same amount. Micron and Intel will continue to participate in the development of NAND Flash memory technologies and will fund these shared costs equally. Joint development of the technology was also expanded to include emerging memory technology. NAND market prices declined across the board in the third quarter. Product mix shifted toward MLC NAND, which drove higher bit sales, as well as significant declines in per bit cost and selling prices. Margins on trade NAND products decreased in the third quarter, primarily as a result of substantial market price declines, particularly for MLC products that outpaced the 29% cost per bit decline quarter-to-quarter. Trade NAND selling prices are down mid-teens quarter-to-date, while trade NAND cost per bit is expected to decline a few percent in the fourth quarter. Trade NAND bit growth is projected to increase in the high single-digit range for the fourth quarter following the robust 68% bit sales growth in the third quarter. Turning now to DRAM, DRAM revenue in the third quarter increased 20% compared to the previous quarter as a result of a 12% increase in bit sales volume. The increase in DRAM average selling prices in the third quarter is primarily due to the effect of the $58 million second quarter charge to revenue from the customer settlement I mentioned earlier. Normalizing for this Q2 settlement, average selling prices were flat quarter-to-quarter. Selling prices in the PC sector of the DRAM market improved through the third quarter, while prices for specialty DRAM products, which trend with a lag compared to PC memory, only recently began to stabilize. Quarter-to-date, selling prices have remained flat as well. DRAM cost per bit declined 4% quarter-to-quarter, but are projected to increase slightly in the fourth quarter as near term, we execute technology node migrations at all of our DRAM fabs. A product mix shift to lower-density mobile and specialty products and the timing of new product quals at our leading technology node are also expected to impact fourth quarter cost per bit and push bit growth down in the high single-digit range in the fourth quarter. NOR sales were stable in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, just over 10% of consolidated revenue. NOR revenue in the fourth quarter is expected to be relatively the same as in the third quarter. NOR product margins improved slightly in the third quarter as cost reductions outpaced selling price reductions in the period. The cost profile for our 200-millimeter NOR fabs is improving as production levels are ramping back up. The charge for idle capacity for the quarter was $30 million compared to $40 million in the second quarter through all of our production operations. The NAND Solutions Group swung to a slight loss in the third quarter, as average selling prices dropped faster than cost reductions. Revenue was up despite the price declines with a higher mix of MLC product and a reduction in inventory. Sales of SSDs and NAND component sales to SSD OEMs increased only slightly in the third quarter compared to the previous quarter as we have worked through the demand issues over the past couple quarters. We are looking forward to additional growth in SSD sales as the market further improves through the remainder of the year. Improvement in operating income for the DRAM Solutions Group in the third quarter reflects higher revenue and lower cost per bit compared to the second quarter as more volume was moved into personal computing sector at slightly improved average selling prices. The $58 million customer settlement in the second quarter was charged entirely to the DSG business unit. Our Wireless Solutions Group continues to show the weakness of this market segment and our customer group in particular, although margins improved slightly in both NAND and NOR wireless sales. Operating income from the Embedded Solutions Group reflects broad-based growth across all 3 memory technologies and the successful transition of legacy NAND designs to more current architectures. SG&A expense in the third quarter was within our guided range and is expected to be between $145 million and $155 million in the fourth quarter. Third quarter expenses for research and development were slightly higher than our guided range due to the volume of development wafers processed and the timing of product qualifications. R&D expense in the fourth quarter is expected to be between $225 million and $235 million. The company generated $686 million in cash flow from operating activities in the third quarter, which includes the $300 million deposit received from Intel. Cash and investments at the end of the quarter was $2.7 billion. This balance includes cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments of $118 million, and noncurrent investment securities of $361 million. The cash and investments balance at the end of the quarter includes $876 million of proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt securities, net of the cost of associated capped call transactions of $103 million and other debt issuance costs. In addition in the third quarter, we called for redemption of the remaining $139 million on our 2013 convertible notes. $23 million, which was converted into 4.4 million shares in the third quarter and the remaining $116 million of this redeemed convert -- was converted into -- will be converted -- or was converted into 22.9 million shares following the end of the quarter. Inventory levels came down in the third quarter compared to Q2 for NAND, DRAM and NOR. A portion of the decrease in NAND inventory was due to the sale of the back-end inventory to Intel in the third quarter that I mentioned. Expenditures for property plant and equipment were $324 million for the third quarter. PP&E expenditures are expected to be approximately $450 million in the fourth quarter and between $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion in fiscal 2013. With that, I'll turn it over to Mark Adams for his comments.
Mark W. Adams: Thanks, Ron. Today I'm going to walk through some of our business highlights, provide a few technology updates, as well as discuss the current market dynamics in the memory industry. Our DRAM Solutions Group exceeded our forecast for sales bit growth and achieved record shipments in all of our segments which include server, networking and storage, graphics and consumer and personal computing. In particular, our specialty DRAM growth continued to outperform. The server market is a good example of a specialty segment where Micron has performed very well over the years achieving strong market share, which is approximately double our overall DRAM market share. This success demonstrates the strength of our product performance, quality and overall customer support model. We believe the combination of unit growth, driven by data center and cloud applications in addition to performance-driven growth in DRAM per system will generate over 40% bit demand growth this year and over 50% in 2013. In the PC segment, we have seen some improvement in demand after 2 quarters of stagnant growth, somewhat related to the improved availability of hard drives. We also believe we are experiencing lower industry supply growth, with 2012 year-over-year bit growth estimates now in the mid to high 20% range. This lower supply growth and demand recovery has led to an improving PC pricing environment. The demand catalyst for the second half of the year include ultrathin product launches utilizing our recently announced DDR3Lm and soldered down 4-gigabyte DDR3-based modules, as well as seasonal recovery and the upcoming Windows 3 -- Windows 8 launch on both Intel and RM-based platforms. In aggregate, we believe PC DRAM content in 2012 will average around 4.5 gigabytes compared to 3.5 gigabytes in 2011. This, in addition to our forecast, is calling for small increasing units. PC DRAM ASPs have increased from the bottom late 2011, early 2012 and recent trends are now generally stable. From a technology perspective, our 30-nanometer process node will continue to ramp in Q4, and we expect to reach 40% to 50% of our output on the leading edge towards the end of the calendar year. This, in addition to our 20-nanometer ramp in 2013, should keep us in solid competitive position moving forward. We remain excited about the progress of our Hybrid Memory Cube product that Mark referenced earlier in his comments. We believe this technology will be revolutionary in terms of memory performance in the server, computing and networking environment. We also shipped our first DDR4 samples to key customers and remain well positioned for market adoption. We continue to focus on applications' specific requirements in our end-user DRAM markets. Our NAND solution group sold a significantly higher number of bits and reduced inventory in Q3. Although SSD unit sales were down slightly in the quarter, we are starting to see signs of increasing demand both in terms of unit growth, as well as average density. We delivered strong revenue growth in the quarter for our enterprise SSD business, with shipments up 33% quarter-over-quarter. Sales in this market stems from our continued success with our mainstream SATA drive P300. Additionally, our high-performance PCIe solution and entry SATA drive, the P400e, continue to gain traction with customers who are looking to see more meaningful revenue contribution from these products next quarter. Our PCIe products exemplify both our award-winning NAND technology, coupled with Micron internally developed control technology for high-performance storage. On the NAND technology front, in early April, Micron and Intel were awarded 2011 Semiconductor of the Year by UBM for our 20-nanometer NAND technology. This is an important achievement, as the award recognizes technology breakthroughs across the entire semiconductor industry. Note that our 20-nanometer processor is a true 20-nanometer symmetrical memory cell, and we were the first company, along with Intel, to produce 128-gigabit monolithic dye. We also began sampling 20-nanometer TLC components with controller companies in Q3 with production expected next quarter. NAND prices remained under pressure for most of the quarter. We think it is worth pointing out that NAND ASPs stayed relatively strong, especially towards the back half of 2011 and this likely had some negative impacts on the growth of embedded NAND in the smartphone, tablet and SSD categories in the first half of 2012. There are also had been some wafer supply additions in the market, including our fab in Singapore. These conditions have combined to cause a near-term oversupply situation. However, subsequent to our quarter end, in the last week or 2, we have seen general prices for NAND have started to stabilize and in some cases increase from where we exited Q3. We remain bullish on the NAND market. The fact the prices have declined at this pace has made -- created demand elasticity with higher demand content in smartphones, tablets and SSDs being protected for the second half of the year. For example, NAND density for tablet is expected to grow close to 90% in 2012. The other good news on the outlook for NAND is what appears to be a very disciplined approach with all of the major suppliers reacting to the weaker pricing environment by slowing down, delaying or even cutting NAND wafer production. Our current CapEx outlook, which Ron described earlier, follows the same industry trend as we're not currently planning to add any new wafer capacity in fiscal year 2013. Coming into the year, market supply growth forecasts for 2012 were in the 70% to 80% range. Today we believe we're looking more like mid to high 50% with a similar outlook for 2013. We believe this supply growth is below the long-term average demand in NAND, which is well above 50%. Revenues in our Wireless Solutions Groups declined mostly due to continued softness in the wireless NOR market, as well as the winding down of the sale of the ex-Numonyx NAND products acquired -- previously acquired at market price. Looking forward, we are encouraged about some new customer engagements targeting both low-end and high-end smartphones. High-end smartphone and Intel ARM-based tablet segment is growing and requires large density at mobile DRAM. For example, mobile DRAM in smartphone is expected to double in 2012. Micron is gaining share in this segment due to mass volume production of our new 30-nanometer mobile DRAM devices, allowing us to cost -- efficiently produce all densities required for this segment of the market. As you can see from our BU financial breakout, our Embedded Solutions Group had solid performance both in terms of growth and profitability. In Q3, the Embedded Group qualified and shipped our initial eMMC products to the embedded customer base. So our strong DRAM revenue, which contributed to record results in our automotive sector and achieved record high embedded NAND revenue with broad growth across densities and segments. We have some significant embedded margin opportunities in DRAM and NAND over the next several quarters, enabled by our broad product portfolio, low-cost position, end-customer and channel relationships. In terms of our NOR business overall, clearly the focus is to maximize the embedded market where the profitability is very attractive. Our big consumption with NOR continues to grow and the overall demand is generally stable. Our embedded business is a great example of how our growing customer base values Micron's broad portfolio of DRAM, NAND and NOR. While we have experienced multiple market conditions over the past 12 months, we are optimistic that we can see an improved memory market during the back half of 2012. As I mentioned on our last call, DRAM pricing seems to have bottomed out in the second quarter and in fact, we saw improved pricing in our Q3. While NAND pricing has declined over the past few months, we are optimistic that the market conditions will improve there as well. Our NOR business continues to provide stable growth and margin at the foundation of our Embedded Solutions Group products. With that, I'd like to hand it back over to Kipp.
Kipp A. Bedard: Great. Thanks, Mark. We will now take questions from callers. [Operator Instructions] Please open up the phone lines.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first questioner in queue is James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I was wondering on the NAND side, if you could talk about the impact of the higher MLC and 3 level per sales recorder, how did that swing your bit shipments and your ASPs? If you can provide some quantification on that. And specifically with respect to TLC, going forward do you expect to increase the proportion of that?
Mark W. Adams: Well, I think that the -- the first part of your question is that some of the application markets that we're building products for are able to adopt the MLC and lower-end products to TLC shipments. We have said all along that our technology lead in NAND has allowed us to ship MLC competitively in the marketplace, even competing with some of our competitors over technology TLC platforms. As we said, going forward, we've enabled both MLC and TLC in these products, and you can see that the -- there's an increase in our shipments in the past quarter, that being that we've been able to enable some of this technology in some of the broader product portfolios.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. Then maybe on the SSD side, can you talk about the inventory level you're seeing out there in the channel or your customers right now? We've heard some data points suggesting there may be -- may have been elevated. Do you still see those elevated inventory levels and do you expect them to be kind of fleshed out over the next quarter or so?
Mark W. Adams: Yes. We actually commented on the last 2 calls that we saw that pretty earlier in the cycle driven primarily that if some of the OEM and channels took in a lot of inventory pre-Christmas, and they were sitting on a bunch of inventory. We think it's actually working its way out fairly well and we've seen pretty strong demand over the last month in the channel and especially on the client SSD side. So we agree that that's been a trend. We think it's working itself out in our -- at the end of Q3 and certainly during Q4.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just a clarification. Could you provide a number for how much of the TLC was as a mix of your NAND sales in the quarter?
Mark W. Adams: TLC was about 9%.
Operator: Our next questioner in queue is Alex Gauna with JMP Securities.
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: I was wondering if you could give some insights into how you see the end-market dynamics specifically on the server side, the notebook side and maybe the mobile wireless side. And I think there's a lot of investor concern that maybe, particularly in the area of notebooks, we might be seeing an artificial strengthening in DRAM because of the hard disk drive recovery and maybe also some safety stocking against Elpida. I was wondering if you could give some insights on how you see demand holding up going forward here with those considerations.
Mark W. Adams: So let me break that up to you. You asked about notebooks, you asked about wireless and the server business. I'll tackle the notebook market, the desktop, notebook market. In general, we do think there has been some support for hard drives, that, that inventory situation's improving, and I think there's a little bit of a catch-up as mostly Corporate PC buying picked up after being away for about 6 months. I don't think they adopted the SSD platform as aggressive as everyone might like, which contributed to the inventory discussion I just had. So I think the notebook market did get some support from an improving hard drive environment. But I also think as we talked about the ultrathin product launches as well as Windows 8, will provide for some support beyond just the hard drive availability, and we think it'll be a better back half of the year. In the server environment, we continue to see a lot of new opportunities, not just the traditional data center main applications. But when you think about some of the new customers, the Facebooks and Googles of the world, we're dropping in data centers more in a shrink-wrapped environment with large server content. We're seeing large volume orders for servers. And on top of that, as I mentioned in my comments, the density per server continues to increase for performance reason. So we're pretty bullish on servers, and we've had 3 consecutive quarters of record bit shipments in the server segment. On the wireless market, as I mentioned earlier, we see growth there as well, especially for us to recapture some share with our low-power DRAM 30-nanometer product as we get into increased ramp for that product in Q4 and beyond, so we have good customer access and the quals are in place to drive some additional volume there.
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: And real quickly as a follow-up with regard to the SSD opportunity in notebooks going forward here, there's been a lot of models being released with hybrid drives and then obviously the MacBooks came out with some very high-density, complete solid-state drives. What are your expectations in terms of hybrid versus solid state? What are the OEMs telling you with regard to the price points to accelerate the full SSD versus the hybrid solution?
Mark W. Adams: Well, I think that we're seeing about a 50/50 split in terms of a hybrid configuration with a pure SSD play configuration. I would say that -- one of the comments I made upfront was that given some of the pricing we're seeing, as well as the improvement technology from a technology node perspective and lower costs in the market today, the economics are getting there. We've been asking the question what will it take to accelerate SSDs, and we think we're pretty close to a fast acceleration of SSDs in the notebook, given the gigabyte -- cost per gigabyte equation. So while -- I think it continues to be fair, but we see about 50%-50% ratio on hybrid versus pure SSD.
Operator: Our next questioner in queue is Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I'm just -- if I could go to the Elpida negotiation. Are you able to advise them at all on wafer starts for DRAM?
D. Mark Durcan: This is Mark. Absolutely not. We -- first of all, we don't have an agreement with them at all yet, and yet to be seen whether we do. Secondly, were we to reach that point, there's also deregulatory approval still required, so we're a long way out before we would have any impact on the Elpida operation.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And can you say what percentage of your DRAM revenue was specialty DRAM?
Kipp A. Bedard: Well Kevin, this is Kipp. Sorry for the delay there. We're about 60% within the specialty category.
Operator: Next questioner in queue is Shawn Webster with Macquarie.
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research: So for your fiscal Q3, your DRAM bit shipments were up 12%, what did your production do sequentially for DRAM? And on the NAND side, I think you said somewhere that your total NAND shipments were up 40% sequentially, and I was wondering what your production did sequentially.
D. Mark Durcan: Yes. We quit giving away the production bit numbers because we just didn't find them very helpful for you. But I will say we're pretty close to guidance for DRAM and actually NAND was up pretty nicely, as we had some pretty good execution through the quarter.
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research: Okay. Well, sticking with production. For your capital expenditure guidance for fiscal '13, what kind of bit growth does that level support for you guys in both the DRAM and NAND side?
D. Mark Durcan: Hard to give out a year-over-year number, which is why a few quarters ago we switched to giving you quarters, maybe 1 to 2 quarters out, because we can make such a pretty dramatic change in bits when we look at the mix effects, so we're just not going to go on a year-over-year basis.
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then in terms of the channel inventories. You talked a bit about NAND, can -- how many weeks are -- is the DRAM market looking like right now?
Mark W. Adams: DRAM right now is in the 3- to 4-week inventories.
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research: Would you characterize that as normal or lean or...
Mark W. Adams: That's pretty normal. Yes, we think it's about right. We've seen, as I said, pretty good activity around our DRAM and with improving price and I won't say favorable, improving price in the market.
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research: And maybe just a final one on the Elpida negotiation, is there -- isn't the ideal situation for you not be the sole bidder, but for there to be no bidder for the assets? In other words, I mean, wouldn't it just going through the bankruptcy proceedings on its own and you guys benefiting directly from potential industry consolidation the best outcome?
D. Mark Durcan: Well, Shawn, obviously the benefits of the deal will depend on the details of the deal. And I think sort of the framework I laid out was if we can acquire assets under terms and conditions that don't result in dilution or significant acquisition of interest-bearing debt that would limit our flexibility, then that can be beneficial to Micron shareholders and I think that's probably all I want to say on that topic.
Operator: Next questioner in queue is C.J. Muse with Barclays.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I guess first question, I was hoping you could provide a little color on time line and/or milestones and how we should think about progress in your discussions with Elpida and anything kind of mandated by the Bankruptcy Court. And I guess as part of that question, how you plan to toggle CapEx requirements that you may need both NAND and DRAM, and I said particularly on NAND.
D. Mark Durcan: So let me cover both those pieces. On the first piece, we're not going to speculate at all on what the time line might look like relative to activity in the Elpida case. It's -- these things are obviously very changeable and a lot of different inputs can move dates around and -- as well as -- also some other things. So what I can tell you is that were we to reach any sort of agreement, we'll obviously be letting you guys know. Having said that, the second part of the question was relative to CapEx and how we might modulate that. I think the $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion number that Ron gave you is obviously for Micron as it exists today. Depending on anything else we might do relative to Elpida, we'll obviously take a look at what most cost-effective place to spend our capital is and that would move our numbers around.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: That's helpful. As a follow-up on the NAND side, I believe you said on your prepared remarks, you thought you would see big growth of mid to high 50s, both '12 and '13. Curious what you see for supply in both those years for the industry? And what would you -- what would get you excited to think that there we could see a faster growth in '13?
D. Mark Durcan: In fact, that reference to mid to high 50s is a supply prediction, and I think Mark also had in his comments that we look to the long-term average demand increase to be well over 60%.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And with -- I guess within that, what kind of underlying assumptions are you making in terms of ultrabooks and full solid-state drives versus hybrids as we enter 2013, and I guess exit as well?
D. Mark Durcan: Well, there's some pretty good third-party data, if you'd like to reference that. But ultras do take up a pretty good content leap in terms of consumption of the overall bits and the wide -- the range is pretty wide, so I might let you just go research that third-party stuff yourself.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, sure. And last question for me, again in your prepared remarks, you talked about optimistic view on memory for the second half of '12, and curious whether you've greater optimism in NAND versus DRAM or both. And if you could provide any color on what's really driving that for you, that will be helpful.
Mark W. Adams: I think for us, on the DRAM side, the segments that I highlighted in my comments around server density growth as well as unit growth, we see a bit of an improvement in the PC, desktop, notebook climate, as well as the networking and storage, we think they're all very favorable for DRAM. Hard for me to call DRAM versus NAND, I think there's -- obviously NAND has gotten negatively impacted on the pricing side over the last quarter to 1.5 quarter. And while we've been cautious in our remarks about NAND, even quarter-to-date, we still -- we've seen a recent drop based around improving demand, picture around client SSDs and we think improved densities on the tablets and smartphones. So we do think that the NAND was a mild supply, oversupply condition. We don't think it's structurally that far out of balance, and we think that the back half demand profile will help that be in a better place.
Operator: Next questioner comes from Daniel Berenbaum with MKM Partners.
Ada Menaker - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division: This is Ada calling in for Dan. Since you've provided some details on negotiations with Elpida, can you give us some color on the rationale behind doing the acquisition in the first place? There's been a lot of speculation among investors about dilution from combining Elpida's operations into your own. So maybe you can help us understand how you think about absorbing the Elpida assets into your own and how that helps your business long term.
D. Mark Durcan: Sure. The Elpida business includes a significant amount of the worldwide capacity, and scale is always an important metric in our business relative to OpEx. It comes with talented employees, as well as a portfolio that while it overlaps with ours in many places, it also has some significant value-added products and technology that is, in some ways, different than ours and supports some segments that are attractive to us. Their customers, while they overlap in some cases, also -- or in other cases different than ours and the acquisition gives us access to an increased attempt. There is a significantly intellectual property available at Elpida as a support to the ongoing business. And finally, I think I would just highlight the wireless segment where they have clearly a strong product portfolio, but without all the various pieces to put together with it. We think that the combination of their portfolio with our portfolio in that area in particular will provide a compelling offering to customers worldwide.
Ada Menaker - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division: So it sounds like you do expect concrete earnings and cash flow accretion from this?
D. Mark Durcan: Well we don't have a deal, so I can't calculate any of those numbers. However, I will tell you that yes, certainly over the long haul we would anticipate a stronger Micron were we to consummate the deal. If that's not the case, we're not going to do a deal.
Operator: Next questioner in queue is Uche Orji with UBS.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Can I just ask you a question? If I back up to the opening remarks when you talked about not wanting to add more debt and much more debt and not wanting to devalue equity holders. Obviously this year, and following up on the last question to say how is that even going to be possible, let me just back up a little bit and ask you for us to understand what your cash comfort levels are. How much cash do you need, minimum, to run this business, and if you were to hypothetically get it, given the increased scale of both companies, any sense as to what is the minimum level of cash flow you require on the balance sheet?
Ronald C. Foster: Uche, this is Ron. If you're looking at the current structure of Micron, it's a -- we were in a pretty good shape, I guess, when you look at the pieces of the -- of where cash is deployed. And we've got pretty good access to our capital around the globe in the current structure of Micron. So it's certainly, it's some $500 million operating cash balance that we could operate our current infrastructure. Now if you're asking about what it looked like in some kind of combination, obviously we aren’t in a place where we could speculate on that without, as Mark mentioned, having a deal, having more information.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Fair enough. Let me switch to some detail on the NAND business. So as we -- you mentioned some pockets of SSD improvement. Can you give us a little bit more insight into the various product categories and where you're seeing strength and weaknesses? And I say this because we've seen some recent data that shows the card market seemed to have -- had a seasonal bounce. I'm not sure whether that is essential to what you're seeing as well. So if you can talk to Micron SD cards, the other cards, USBs and all that end products in NAND, just to give us a sense of what you're seeing, that will be helpful.
Mark W. Adams: I think actually, you got a good take on it. I think we've seen, believe it or not, retail has kind of helped, relatively stable for us in the NAND business and we've also seen what -- we think as an explainable rebound, at some level, on the client SSD segment as well. As we look at it, there was a -- there's a fairly heavy inventory build coming out of the holidays, and we talked about that in the last couple of calls. And we've started to see some increased channel shipment of SSDs over the last few weeks, and we're pretty optimistic that that's a good signal going forward.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And just finally, if I look at the lag effects you described for the specialty areas, any more details as to -- I know you said you see stabilization there in specialty memory. In terms of the demand drivers for those, I would have expected a little bit more given the initial ramp of Romley, I would expect a little bit more upside from the server side. Is that a misplaced expectation? And if where -- if Romley is ramping as well we seem to believe, when might you might start to see that? And then on the networking side, any more detail as to how you expect that strategy just based on demand factors you see on ground going forward?
Mark W. Adams: Yes. Maybe I could reinforce, we're seeing that effect as we speak. As I mentioned, our server bit growth over the last 3 quarters has continued to grow, and that we've set records over the last 3 quarters. In the networking segment, the same; we have some great performance in terms of bit shipments. So we're pretty bullish about those 2 segments, and we think we're seeing the effects of that plus continued application growth around expanding data center application, as well as cloud architecture.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Sorry, I wanted to just specify, I was asking more about the pricing trends for those areas.
Mark W. Adams: Well, I think as Ron stated in his comments, just there historically has been a lag effect that indexes up, the PC, desktop, notebook market, the commodity market. And as you see improvement in the desktop, notebook DRAM environment, there's normally a solid transition. We anticipate that there should be improvement in our business going forward.
Kipp A. Bedard: I would like to apologize ahead of time for not being able to get to everybody in the queue. We do have time for one more question, but I would like to remind everyone we're hosting an Analyst Day in the fall here at the corporate headquarters in Boise on October 12. You can get more details on the website. And with that, we'd like to take one more call.
Operator: Our final question for today's event comes from Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.
Brian C. Peterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: This is Brian Peterson for Hans. Just a question on the NOR business, it was actually a little bit better than expected this quarter, despite some exposure to the wireless side. Could you talk about how you expect that business to trend going forward?
Mark W. Adams: I think we've commented in the past that the wireless NOR has been declining and maybe even a little bit faster than we had thought. Having said that, as I mentioned, our Embedded Solutions Group has done a pretty good job in growing the business and growing our units there. And certainly, NOR is the core foundation in addition to adjacencies around DRAM and NAND in that business. But the NOR business in embedded remains pretty solid with a good pricing environment, and really long-term design-in benefits there. So we think NOR will continue to be very stable around the embedded business going forward.
Brian C. Peterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And just a follow-up on Elpida. Is there a certain period where you have exclusive negotiation rights? Or is there a time line where this deal needs to be worked out? Or just any kind of prospective you can provide there.
D. Mark Durcan: I'm afraid we can't comment on any of that detail at this point. We're obviously under NDA.
Kipp A. Bedard: Okay and with that, we'd like to thank everyone for participating on the call today. If you will please bear with me, I need to repeat the Safe Harbor protection language. During the course of this call, we may have made forward-looking statements regarding the company and the industry.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Devon, and I'll be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would welcome everyone to the Micron Technology Second Quarter 2012 Financial Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Kipp Bedard. Sir, you may begin your conference.
Kipp A. Bedard: Thank you, and welcome, all, to Micron Technology's Second Quarter 2012 Financial Release Conference Call. On the call today is Mark Durcan, CEO and Director; Mark Adams, President; and Ron Foster, Chief Financial Officer and Vice President of Finance.  This conference call, including audio and slides, is also available on Micron's website at micron.com. If you have not had an opportunity to review the second quarter 2012 financial press release, again it is available on our website at micron.com.  Our call will be approximately 60 minutes in length. There will be an audio replay of this call accessed by dialing (404) 537-3406 with a confirmation code of 62533629. This replay will run through Wednesday, March 29, 2012, at 5:30 p.m. Mountain Time. A webcast replay will be available on the company's website until March 2013. We encourage you to monitor our website at micron.com throughout the quarter for the most current information on the company, including information on the various financial conferences that we will be attending.  Please note the following Safe Harbor statement.

D. Mark Durcan: Thanks, Kipp. I'd like to begin my comments today with a few thoughts on restructuring of our joint development relationship and joint manufacturing relationship with Intel before commenting briefly on market conditions, and then looping back to highlight some of the technology and business unit accomplishments during this quarter. So first of all, Micron's partnership with Intel on NAND Flash is, of course, a very important relationship for us as well as a significant piece of our business. As many of you are aware, we reached definitive agreements this quarter to restructure or rejuvenate that partnership. And as part of that process, we agreed to purchase Intel's share of the output from the jointly-owned NAND operations in both Manassas, Virginia, and IMFS Singapore.  The purchase capacity was roughly 30,000 wafers per month, and Micron will sell a portion of those wafers back to Intel under a for-profit take-or-pay supply agreement. The incremental profit, along with -- the incremental profit capacity, along with the completion of the initial ramp of the new fab in Singapore, will lead to structural margin improvement going forward.  The life of the remaining joint venture facility, which is in Lehigh, Utah, was extended to 2024. And the scope of our technology relationship was expanded to include certain memory technologies beyond the floating gate and NAND products we had historically been working on together. So I think in summary, both partners consider the relationship to date highly successful and were both very excited to be carrying this relationship on in the future. On the technology development front, we had a strong quarter. We were excited to complete the construction of the new addition to our R&D cleanroom in Boise, Idaho, and begin installing tools there to support our leading-edge NAND, DRAM, NOR and phase-change memory nodes as well as a number of interesting, new emerging memory technologies. We made good progress on our next 2 NAND technology nodes in the development fab, and our -- as well as our 20-nanometer DRAM node. We also made progress scaling up to 300-millimeter substrates on our 45-nanometer NOR process and in developing a new 300-millimeter phase-change memory process. Moving forward, we look to deploy both of these new 300-millimeter NOR and phase-change processes in the manufacturing fabs over the next year. In manufacturing, we had a nice quarter relative to production ramp and yield execution. I'm sure Ron will comment in more detail shortly, but a couple of highlights to note are the completion of the ramp to roughly 70,000 wafers per month of IMFS in Singapore and the 30-nanometer DRAM node introduction and successful early ramp at Inotera. We also had good early yield learning -- sorry, we also had good early 30-nanometer yield out of the DRAM fab in Singapore. So in aggregate, we now have successful transfer of that 30-nanometer node into all Micron DRAM fabs. Additionally, it's worth noting that we can now ship 20-nanometer NAND out of all 3 Micron NAND fabs, the 2 wholly owned ones as well as the joint fab in Lehigh. Overall, we had strong bit growth and cost reduction in both NAND in DRAM during the quarter.  Switching now briefly to markets and our products. The second quarter was obviously a weaker environment for pricing than we would have liked. Mark Adams, I think, will likely comment more in Q&A, but seasonal factors, combined with supply chain disruptions due to the Thailand flooding, as well as, I think, general slower economic activity all had an impact.  Recently, we're seeing improvements in the DRAM market. And while we don't predict what's going to happen going forward, depending on application, I think concerns over supply seem to be having a positive or at least stabilizing effect on OEM pricing.  For NAND, the mix of high-density 2- and 3-bit-per-cell as well as seasonal demand weakness drove our ASPs lower during the quarter. While we were able to offset most or all of this with cost reductions, we did suffer some degradation of NAND margins due to sell-through of Mnemonics legacy NAND products, which had been purchased in the market at market prices. Overall, we see generally healthy supply and demand outlook for NAND moving forward as measured by -- as measured industry fab ramps are offset by anticipated demand growth in a number of key markets like smartphones, tablets and SSDs.  Wireless NOR, on the other hand, volumes continue to decline in the wireless space with the transition from feature to smartphones. Embedded NOR, however, remained strong, and we see long-term attractive margins and share gain opportunities in that space. In the product area, highlights for the quarter include continued success with Hybrid Memory Cube enablement and design and activities across high-performance computing, including high-end server applications as well as across networking; good success with all 3 design wins across a number of different networking companies; strong design and activity of embedded NOR in both automotive and amusement markets. Additionally, relative to NOR, we're now shipping the industry's broadest portfolio of SPI NOR products.  We saw good growth in mobile DRAM bit shipments, in roughly 20% range, and we're seeing early signs of design and acceleration given some of the challenges some of our competitors are facing. Finally, in NAND during the quarter, we shipped [indiscernible] samples of our 3-bit-per-cell, 20-nanometer, 128-gigabit NAND Flash to enabling controller vendors; we shipped over 0.5 million solid-state drives; and finally, we were prominently endorsed by both EMC as a preferred partner for PCI SSDs and our VFCache product, as well as by Dell for their PowerEdge servers with the Express Flash PCIe SSDs. In reference to consolidation, I think I'll just close by trying to preempt some of the questions. And noting that as usual, we don't comment on rumors and speculation in the press, as we've said consistently in the past, we'll be evaluating market situations as they develop and look for opportunities to strengthen Micron's competitive position.  So with that, let me turn it over to Ron.
Ronald C. Foster: Thanks, Mark. The company's second quarter of fiscal 2012 ended on March 1. And as usual, we provided a schedule containing certain key results for the quarter as well as certain guidance for the next quarter. The materials presented on a few slides that follow is as well also on our website.  The second quarter results posted a net loss of $224 million, or $0.23 per share, on net sales of $2,067,000,000. Total sales in the second quarter relatively flat compared to the prior quarter, reflecting slightly higher NAND and DRAM sales that were more than offset by the lower sales of NOR products, as Mark mentioned. Demand for wireless NOR products continue to be impacted by seasonal weakness, lower performance of certain customers where we have greater concentration and continued transition of certain applications to NAND devices. Consolidated gross margin for the second quarter declined from 14.6% to 13% compared to the first quarter.  Before getting into specific results for the quarter, I want to expand a bit on Mark's comments regarding the IM Flash arrangement we announced recently with Intel. As a result of the contemplated transactions, Micron will purchase Intel's 18% ownership interest in the IM Flash operation in Singapore. In addition, Micron will purchase from the IM Flash entity its production assets in the Micron fab in Virginia, and the associated lease of a portion of that facility will be terminated.  Total consideration for Micron's purchases is expected to be approximately $600 million. The exact amount may vary up to the time of closing, but approximates the book value of our net assets. In accordance with the terms of our new supply agreement, Intel has agreed to make a deposit with Micron of $300 million, which may be refunded or applied to Intel's future purchases under the agreement. In the third quarter, results are expected to include a loss of approximately $20 million associated with the termination of the Virginia lease. The existing relationship and supply arrangement through IMFT will remain intact, although consisting solely of the output from the Lehigh operation. Sales under this arrangement will continue to be based on relative ownership using long-term negotiated prices approximating cost. In addition to this supply agreement, Micron and Intel will enter into new agreements, where Micron will supply Intel NAND Flash products, as well as certain emerging memory technology products in the future. Sales under these new arrangements will be included in Micron's consolidated results as trade NAND sales. Micron and Intel will continue to participate in the development of NAND Flash memory technologies and will fund these shared costs equally.  Depending on the timing of the closing of the transactions, we anticipate IM Flash sales to Intel will be approximately the same level in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter. After that, we expect to see an increase in the percentage of Micron NAND revenue sold at trade pricing.  Now let's walk through a few of the details for the second quarter. Our Singapore IM Flash fab continued to deliver on its manufacturing ramp, as Mark indicated, achieving the targeted output level for its original ramp. This represented a 30% increase in wafer production in the second quarter compared to the prior quarter. While Micron's ownership of the Singapore operation is currently 82%, during the second quarter, we took 78% of that facility's production output in accordance with the existing agreements. The output from the IM Flash U.S. operations remains consistent with a 51-49 ownership split. The equity and income or loss from equity method investees’ line consists primarily of our share of Inotera's net loss for the period, as you can see on the P&L. Although the net loss for these investments was roughly the same quarter-to-quarter, improved Inotera performance resulting from higher yields and improved manufacturing efficiencies was partially offset by our share of losses from write-offs of certain deferred tax assets in 2 of our equity investments reported in that line. Early in March, after the end of our second fiscal quarter, Micron completed the equity investment in Inotera of $170 million, and the $133 million short-term loan made to Inotera earlier in the quarter was repaid. This investment enables Inotera to initiate its conversion to Micron's 30-nanometer process technology. The initial phase of the conversion is targeted for roughly 1/3 of Inotera's production capacity, with Micron taking a greater share of this 30-nanometer output as a result of our equity injection. Trade NAND bit sales to Micron customers grew 36% in the second quarter, primarily as a result of a higher level of production from IM Flash Singapore quarter-over-quarter as that operation performed at its targeted level for substantially all of the second quarter. Our volume mix of MLC versus SLC NAND in the second quarter was consistent with the first quarter. Production costs per bit for trade NAND products decreased 18% in the second quarter compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to the higher production volumes on advanced technology nodes in the period.  Margins on trade NAND products decreased slightly in the second quarter. However, selling prices declined more than cost -- the cost reductions. Quarter to date for the third quarter, selling prices for trade NAND products are down mid-20s compared to the average for the second quarter. DRAM revenues have been fairly flat for the last 2 quarters as higher bit sales have been offset by decreases in selling prices across both periods. Specifically, in the second quarter, per-bit DRAM selling prices decreased 16% compared to the first quarter. This decrease was impacted by both market price declines and a somewhat lower mix of specialty products sold in the premium markets in the quarter. DRAM bit production and bit costs in the third quarter are expected to be down a couple of percent as we shift mix to maximize margins. Quarter to date for the third quarter, selling prices are relatively flat compared to the second quarter average. Sales of SSDs, including NAND components sold to fabless SSD manufacturers, grew about 15% quarter-to-quarter as these devices continue to gain acceptance in the marketplace. Our Wireless Solutions Group continues to be impacted by weakness in the wireless NOR market in conjunction with weakness we are experiencing with our customer concentration. We are working to adjust the customer and product mix in this space to drive future growth. As I mentioned last quarter, we reduced production in our 200 millimeter NOR fabs. Although charges for idle capacity were lower compared to the previous quarter, they were still about $40 million in the second quarter and primarily impacted our Embedded Solutions Group and Wireless Solutions Group operating results. SG&A expense in the second quarter increased and was approximately $20 million above our guidance range for the quarter, primarily as a result of a couple of onetime charges, including the accelerated stock vesting and benefits in the quarter and the expense associated with a committed contribution to a university. SG&A expense for the third quarter is anticipated to be between $155 million and $165 million.  At the end of the second quarter, we capitalized and began depreciating the new R&D fab at our Boise campus. R&D expense is expected to trend slightly lower for the remainder of the fiscal year.  You may have noticed from the financial results summary slide presented earlier that we had a larger-than-usual gain in other nonoperating income. This primarily related to minority equity investments in several technology companies that were sold to other parties and resulted in a gain. The company generated $574 million in cash flow from operating activities in the second quarter and generated a free cash flow of $145 million. The cash balance at the end of the quarter was $2.1 billion. During the second quarter, we entered into equipment financing arrangements that brought in $230 million in financing cash flows.  Expenditures for property plant and equipment were $429 million for the second quarter. We continue to see total expenditures for PP&E for the fiscal year approximating $2 billion, with the largest portion having been incurred already in the first quarter. With that, I'll close and turn it back to Kipp
Kipp A. Bedard: Thank you, Ron. We will now take questions from callers [Operator Instructions].
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from David Wong from Wells Fargo.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: On your supply agreement with Intel, can you tell us how long the supply agreement lasts for? And is it for fixed wafer prices? Or do the prices move with market NAND prices?
Ronald C. Foster: This is Ron, David. The supply agreement with Intel is set up so that it's a fixed amount of volume. And we have a profit margin built into the agreement, and it's set up to extend for a number of years into the total agreement period.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bob Gujavarty of Deutsche Banks.
Bobby Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I mean, I was actually pretty impressed you were able -- the inventories didn't go up. You were able to move a lot of bits in a somewhat muted demand environment. Can you talk about what helped you do that? Was it your branded products? Was it share gains? Was it perhaps the Alpeta bankruptcy? Just curious around that.
Mark W. Adams: Bob, it's Mark Adams. I think the -- you've listed a couple of key contributors to that end result on inventory. Certainly, we saw a mild recovery in the PC business against expectations going into the post-holiday quarter as the hard drive industry started to recover and that’s helped us on some stronger DRAM pricing coming out of the quarter, like desktop notebook commodity. SSDs continue to be a positive bright spot for us in terms of bit shipments through the quarter. We had growth there. And we continue to find growth opportunities around server bits. Our server bit shipments were another record, the second consecutive quarter we had a record in bit shipments to servers. So combined, there's been some good application segment performance for us.
Bobby Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Great. And just a quick follow-up, I mean, if I could, on the server comment. Do you think there's an opportunity to up-sell your server DRAM product mix based on the Romley [ph] platform? My understanding is probably a little bit of a maybe perhaps a little bit more low power. Just curious if that'll help your server mix.
Mark W. Adams: Yes, I think it will. I think that's in front of us, too. I don't think that's happening today. I think the Romley adaptation is probably -- if you went back into the back half of last year, they -- you would have thought there'd be more market penetration around it. But I think it will, and it's in front of us and they'll benefit us in the future quarters.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest.
Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: My question is on the quarter to date DRAM pricing. You are guiding to flat quarter to date, and you have seen recent upward movement in the contract pricing on the DRAM side. So could you help us understand that?
Mark W. Adams: Sure. The phenomenon really occurs when the market does churn pricing. Some of the premium specialty markets we're in lagged that effect, so they may, in fact, have lower pricing while the commodity desktop-notebook actually trend back up. And that's where we are seeing improvement, in the desktop-notebook commodity segment. And our specialty markets are lagging in improvement and in turnaround. So that's where it comes out about flat, all kind of around the mix equation.
Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: Sure, helpful. Another question, on the Embedded group. I -- there's a slide here that's showing that operating income from that group was lower compared to last quarter. Could you just help us understand that as well?
Mark W. Adams: Could you repeat the question? I'm sorry, I...
Unknown Executive: Embedded profit was lower.
Mark W. Adams: Embedded profits? Yes...
Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: Yes, Embedded profit.
Mark W. Adams: Yes, sure. I'm sorry, but that -- the -- Mark Durcan commented earlier on -- that the wireless NOR market is probably more accelerating in its decline in demand. I think that put more NOR inventory in the market and then hit some of the pricing that gave us a mild erosion on the Embedded profitability. And we had to react to that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Amir with Lazard Capital Markets.
Daniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Can you comment? What type of consideration does the company take in terms of potentially looking at consolidation in the industry? What actions would you take? What things would you do financially? So just give a little more clarity what the decision making behind it if you decide to pursue that opportunity.
D. Mark Durcan: Well, I'm not sure I'm going to be able to give you a whole lot of clarity on this, but, obviously, there are a lot of things that go into the mix when you look at consolidation opportunities, and you have to look at all of them in aggregate in order to make a decision as to whether something is going to be beneficial to Micron or its shareholders or not. Some of the things that we look at, obviously, are: What's the potential price of the assets you're looking at? What do you get beyond just physical assets in terms of intellectual property or technology? What is the form of consideration you might be contemplating? How does it change the competitive landscape relative to product portfolio? Clearly, we always can get -- well, not always, but we typically consider that we'll have scale efficiencies not only at the manufacturing level but also at the operating expense, R&D, SG&A. So scale has virtue in our business. All of those things kind of go in the hopper as well as probably a number that I didn't think of off the top of my head, but we look at all of those.
Daniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Okay, and a follow-up on the SSD side. I mean, up 15% this quarter. I mean, should we expect similar growth rates in the next few quarters? I mean, how should we be looking at the SSD mix?
Mark W. Adams: Yes, I think I probably ought to speak to dynamic here, that if you go back into our last quarter, we saw a fair amount of OEM pull and channel pull ahead of -- in the last quarter due to the lack of hard drive availability. And what we saw after that was that the sell-through of that pull-through wasn't as much as the OEMs and the channel anticipated. So I would characterize it as a slightly decelerating growth as they -- as we work through the inventory. I think this is a short-term phenomenon, and I think you'll see our SSDs continue to grow. And I think maybe another quarter of right around this level is reasonable. But I think it's just a work-through out of the, I guess, the overexcitement around the preholiday SSDs given the hard drive issue.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I was wondering if you could talk about the DRAM supply situation in the market right now. How many of your competitors do you think have latent DRAM capacity which still has yet to come online given the tough environment we're seeing out there? And maybe you can estimate that as a fraction of industry revenues and whether you see any of that supply coming back to the market.
D. Mark Durcan: Yes, well, I think there is some supply off-line. I'd put it in the 5% to 10% range currently. And with the recent uptick in pricing, I think you would normally see some of that coming back online, but you've got to balance that against, obviously, the situation that some of our competitors find themselves in of -- relative to cash availability. And so I think we're at a reasonably stable point currently with maybe a small amount of capacity coming back online in some of the Taiwanese manufacturers.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. And then looking out into next year, there seems to be a little controversy in terms of the NAND market and what the expectations for NAND bits -- bit growth in the industry will be, some people calling for as high as 70%, others calling for more like 50%. I was wondering if you could maybe weigh in on where you see that bit growth coming in for next year and what factors are going to drive that either higher or lower.
D. Mark Durcan: Sure. Our internal modeling is in the sort of 65% to 70% range. But there's -- obviously, there’s some guardrails around that. We don't have complete accuracy or precision relative to our information. What can drive that up and down, obviously, is mix of 3-level cell versus 2-level cell versus single-level cell. So product mix going to the market can have a significant impact on bit growth without necessarily having a significant impact on profitability or cost per wafer. We have seen some level of new capacity come -- certainly planning to come into the market, and we've seen that be what I would characterize as relatively measured and, in some cases, muted relative to initial plans. And so I think what we anticipate is something in the 65% to 70% range. And if the market's stronger, maybe it'll be a little bit higher. And if the market's weaker, maybe it'll be a little bit lower.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. And just to confirm that, it's a 2013 estimate, right?
D. Mark Durcan: This is 2012.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Oh, yes, I was asking about 2013, sorry.
D. Mark Durcan: Oh, I'm sorry. 2013, obviously, less visibility. And from a technology migration perspective, we would expect it to be slower as opposed to -- as compared to 2012. So less from technology migrations. However, there is capacity coming online, and I don't have that figure exactly in front of me. So I would say it's probably in a similar range, actually, when you bake it all together.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster with Macquarie.
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research: I was wondering if you could share with us what your sequential production did in fiscal Q2?
Kipp A. Bedard: We had a -- as Mark commented in his opening remarks, Shawn, the operations all executed quite well. So in all the categories that we gave guidance for last quarter, we beat them all.
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research: But what did they do sequentially? I mean, your shipments were up 21%, for example, in DRAM. What -- there's -- is that how much production was also up?
Kipp A. Bedard: Pretty close, yes. We're -- we beat that. We guided mid to high teens. Last quarter, we beat that by a little bit.
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research: Okay. Same thing on the NAND side?
Kipp A. Bedard: Correct.
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then in terms of the production outlook going into fiscal Q3, can you walk us through why exactly it's going to be flat again? And maybe, can you share with us what you expect the trajectory to be in some of the later quarters?
Kipp A. Bedard: Yes, one of the things you're seeing a lot of now how the mix -- your -- you hear us talk a lot about mix in terms of ASP and cost. And it also impacts our guidance on a quarterly basis for production bit growth. And here's an example where, as Mark Adams previously noted, we see a growing opportunity in servers. The bits for those wafers tend to be lower. And so as a result, when you're moving production more in that direction, then you can -- you'll slow some of the just quarter-to-quarter comparisons on production bit growth. So we do see opportunities in the specialty area. We're moving wafers there to respond to the market. And now there's -- those aren't always your most efficient bit wafers in markets like that. Anything to that?
D. Mark Durcan: No, I think that's a good characterization of what's going on, Kipp, is mix more and more drives what the bit growth is going to be on -- in any given quarter. In terms of just an overall "What are we looking at for the next couple of quarters for DRAM," as we noted, next quarter flattish and in that same range, probably more later in the year. On NAND, I think I'd say 15%, plus or minus, and lumpy going forward.
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then if I could really quickly on -- one more on the NAND. The NAND pricing, at least when I compare it to some of the contract and spot calculations we make here, is -- your pricing seems to be a little bit worse, both in the reported quarter and for your guidance going to fiscal Q3. Is that also a mix effect? Or is there something else happening there?
Mark W. Adams: Yes, that's right. I think that it's a mix effect going to less value-add segments during the quarter.
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research: I'm sorry, less value-added segments?
Mark W. Adams: Yes. Our pricing -- your comment was our pricing declines looked larger than other data points you were looking at?
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research: Yes.
Mark W. Adams: So as we commented on the SSD situation, we're working our way out of that. You'll see our -- put our bits into more of the -- a retail-oriented commodity card USB business, those types.
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research: Oh, I see. And how much was Intel for you in the quarter for NAND?
Kipp A. Bedard: $255 million.
D. Mark Durcan: Same level as last quarter. So let me just add on this, this mix issue. To the extent you see significant ASP declines that are toggled [ph] by mix, I mean, you also are seeing some pretty significant cost declines in those same products.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citi.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Could you give us an update just on where we stand in terms of memory inventories that are out there? And should we expect anything unusual as we approach the launch of Windows 8?
Mark W. Adams: You know what? Except for what we identified in SSDs, I think overall, things are in pretty good balance. On the DRAM front, based on some of the dynamics going on with competition, it seems that DRAM is in a pretty healthy place, pretty moderate inventory. Our OEMs have come back with pretty strong upside demand signals for us in the -- in Q3. The dynamic in the spot market's a little bit different because we expect some of the smaller players liquidating for cash flow purposes. But in general, the market inventory situation is pretty good on DRAM. And in NAND, as I described in an earlier comment, I think the inventory situations needed just to work through this quarter on selling through SSD inventory that we have carried forward, and I think that is a short-term phenomenon. And I think overall, when we look at tablet growth and smartphones and SSDs combined, I think we're bullish out in the midterm and the longer term.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Maybe just to follow up on your comment that you're seeing upside demand from the -- I guess from the PC side of the house. As -- and should we be therefore -- I mean, normally, Q2 is a seasonally down quarter for PC. But obviously, we've got hard drive issues that are still at play here. Is it predominantly the hard drive situation continuing to ease that's driving that upside demand? Or do you -- is there something else going on in PC side so you need to get [indiscernible]?
Mark W. Adams: I think that's part of it. I think the other part of it is just as we're talking about maybe some negative impact on the SSD side, we think that because the -- primarily the corporate sector held off on PC procurements given the higher price SSD systems in the fall, we think there's some strength in the PC market out towards the next quarter or so.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Stern Agee.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: On the DRAM side, I know you guided ASP is flat. What kind of cost structures do you see getting to the May quarter from shrinks, et cetera?
Kipp A. Bedard: It's down a couple of percent.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: And in terms of shrinks, well, from what are you going -- what node are you going to, 30-nanometer or 21-nanometer, on the DRAM side?
Kipp A. Bedard: Yes, we're seeing a nice shrink road map there, and again, taking into consideration the comments we just made about a lot of times the specialty cost per bit is slightly higher than the commodity cost per bit. So as you're transitioning to more of those bits on a Q-to-Q comparison, you may not get what you expect to see in the old days when 90% of the output was all PC commodity and you could go through a shrink and measure a pretty -- put a pretty linear methodology. So keep this mix shift in mind.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Got it. And on the NAND side, you mentioned ASP is -- it looks like it was down a little bit more, but it was impaired by some legacy Numonyx product. What does -- how much of that was impacting the ASP? And do you see some of that dragging into the third quarter, fiscal third quarter also?
Kipp A. Bedard: We won't break out the contribution, if you will, to that sell-through. But generally speaking, we have about a couple more quarters to work through that inventory.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Got it. So some of that is the activity that is that has to be tied -- basically the Numonyx stuff that's going broke?
Kipp A. Bedard: That's correct.
Operator: Our next question comes from Uche Orji with UBS.
Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: This is Steven calling on behalf of Uche. First question I had on the DRAM side, could you talk about what your capacity mix you're starting to have on 30 nanometers for DRAM by the end of the fiscal year?
D. Mark Durcan: Yes, Steve, end of the calendar year, we'll be roughly 50%.
Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, great. And also, in terms of your DRAM sales, what's the mix between competing versus noncompeting application?
Mark W. Adams: The overall computing personal systems piece of our business was about just slightly below 20%. Well, that's a little higher than that, was that?
Unknown Executive: Of the?
Unknown Executive: Yes.
Mark W. Adams: On personal systems? Okay, about 1/3 of it -- I guess that's right. About 1/3 of it in personal systems relative to the other markets.
Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. So that does not include server, correct?
Mark W. Adams: Right.
Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, perfect. And then I guess the other major question I had on the DRAM business was for the specialty products. Just generally speaking, I know there's probably a range of process technologies that the different product lines are on. But just probably speaking for the higher-volume, like server packs, for example, will that be also within, say, 30 nanometers, for example, just due to the growing bit demand that you see in that market?
D. Mark Durcan: Yes, we're actually very encouraged with the progress on our 30-nanometer, not only in terms of yields and the way the ramps are going generally but also the quality level and the power performance it's delivering for the server market. So we anticipate that we will be able to accelerate that 30-nanometer ramp above and beyond what we would normally do. And we're still in the early process of qualifying all those products, but we're very encouraged by the way that's going. So generally speaking, we believe that we'll be able to ramp that node more aggressively than maybe we would typically do while maintaining a good mix of servers.
Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Perfect. Just one last quick one, if I could, on trade NAND bit sales. I know you guys mentioned it's up 36% in fiscal Q2. I'm just wondering. How much of that is also captured by any SSD products that you guys built during the quarter? Or is that 36% number purely, of course, that you guys sold through in the market of that type? Are those cards or other embedded applications?
Kipp A. Bedard: If I understood your question right, it was a little bit confusing, but I think the answer you're looking for is about 30%.
Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: For the non -- When excluding your SSD product sales, correct?
D. Mark Durcan: Well, I think what we're trying to say is about 30% of the trade NAND is SSDs in one way, shape or form. So either internal SSDs or NAND that we sell into somebody else's SSD products.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Wondering if you could talk about the timing of the 20-nanometer NAND ramp? And sort of where you expect to be capacity-wise in the second half of this year for that technology node?
D. Mark Durcan: Yes, that's going to be -- again, it's going to be driven by product mix and the applications we're serving. I commented at the beginning of the call that we're actually ramping 20-nanometer in all 3 fabs and are now making plans to position additional capacity given the way technology node is going as well. So we're quite happy with the 20-nanometer performance and its acceptance in the marketplace. And that'll probably drive us to accelerate conversion as opposed to what we originally had planned.
Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Got it. And them as a follow-up, maybe you can just provide us with an update on the timing of your 20-nanometer DRAM ramp. And then for Ron, do you expect idle capacity charges for your NOR fabs in Q3? And if so, can you just give us a rough sense on how much those charges will be?
D. Mark Durcan: So this is Mark. Let me take the 20-nanometer DRAM node. That'll be early production in the summer next year.
Ronald C. Foster: Yes. And Harlan, in terms of the idle capacity, we've had some improvement, as I mentioned, with a little bit less idle capacity in our 200-millimeter activities. But we will continue to have some effect of that in the following quarter or 2, that's for sure. And then we expect it to pick up some later in the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Just to expand on Harlan's question on the 20-nanometer NAND Flash, will most of those products be 128-gigabit? Is that part of the mix?
D. Mark Durcan: Sorry, can you repeat the question?
Unknown Executive: Moving...
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I -- you're expecting the -- you're moving all 3 fabs on NAND Flash to 20 nanometers. What is the product mix? Is that 128-gigabit compared to...
D. Mark Durcan: They'll be a mix of 64 to 128.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. So that will help drive down the overall ASPs so much?
D. Mark Durcan: Well, it'll -- yes, typically, the higher density's selling at a slight discount, although early in the life, you can actually get a premium. So it kind of depends when the other guys get caught up. So there'll also be -- by the way, it makes it 2-bit, 3-bit-per-cell. As I commented coming into the call, we're sampling our 3-bit, 20-nanometer, 120-gig as well.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And on ultrabooks now, it seems like the second generation of ultrabooks are being announced. How do you see the DRAM content? And then also, you have the C [ph] content for you?
Mark W. Adams: I think both's favorable for us. I think the challenge for us in the marketplace is really around pricing and the acceptance of the platform and volume. We think it's more of a best-case, a holiday product of 2012, more a 2013 volume product. But we still think it's pretty favorable in the DRAM side and, obviously, very positive on the NAND and the SSD form factor.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Goodman with CLSA.
Ryan Goodman - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division: I had a question on the server side or in the specialty side of DRAM. You had mentioned record bit shipments during the quarter but also a mix out of specialty was having an impact on pricing trends. So maybe, could you just help me understand exactly what happened in the quarter and how we should be modeling that going forward for the year?
Mark W. Adams: Sure. I think if you look it over -- the impact from the execution of the additional capacity we got out of Inotera, the overall output grew. And then our -- when I referred to the bit shipments, our bit shipments in servers grew as well, but not at the overall capacity.
Ryan Goodman - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division: Okay. And then on just one other area within DRAM. You had mentioned mobile DRAM. It sounds like you guys are getting a bit more traction there. Maybe just an update on how that's looking today and how are -- that's been kind of written as a 2013 story in the past. How is it looking for 2012? Could that pull in at all given what's going on with your competitor?
Mark W. Adams: I think from an opportunity standpoint, there's an immense opportunity as we get more and more converted over to 30-series product, I think, if there are volumes in that category increased significantly.
Ryan Goodman - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division: Okay. So kind of second half of this year, possibly?
Mark W. Adams: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Berenbaum with MKM Partners.
Ada Menaker: This is Ada in for Dan. I got a couple of questions for you. The first one is you talked about the potential asset purchase from Alpeta. What are some of the other likely scenarios and kind of, what would be negative scenarios, positive scenarios? And under what circumstances would you benefit the most?
D. Mark Durcan: I think that's going to be way too much speculation for us to comment on, Ada, sorry. [ :p id="A01" name="Ada Menaker" type="A" /> No problem. And in terms of NAND and the restructuring of the Intel JV, can you maybe talk about where you see NAND margins going as a result versus trade NAND?
D. Mark Durcan: Yes, again, we don't like to forecast either gross margins or net margins moving forward in time. There's just too much uncertainty relative to ASPs. What we can say is that the increased scale that we now have at our -- in our NAND business, not only by virtue of the asset acquisition from Intel but also by virtue of the successful ramp of IMFS, puts us in a much better position relative to our operating expenses relative to the overall scale of our business.
Ada Menaker: And in terms of OpEx as a result of the restructuring, any risks to that or...
D. Mark Durcan: Relative to the restructuring with Intel?
Ada Menaker: Yes.
D. Mark Durcan: No, I don't think so. We're anticipating that'll close very early in April. And again, we think it's a pretty beneficial agreement for both partners, actually. And Ron, by the way, is just reminding me that the other significant thing to keep in mind relative to the asset acquisition from Intel is that the -- when you think about Micron's margins in NAND overall, there's a significantly higher percentage now of that product that is trade NAND versus sold at Intel to cost. So that will also have an impact in the way you model margins.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I guess to stick on that topic of how we model this transaction, when I think about your cost of revenues, Ron, it's been a really pretty stable number. As you add capacity, cost of revs rises a little bit, as we saw this quarter, about $15 million. Is there a change in that cost of revenues line that's associated with you now owning the equipment? Or have you already been capturing that cost in that cost of revenue line?
Ronald C. Foster: Yes, Doug, the -- we consolidate all these joint ventures. So all the structure on the balance sheet, P&L, et cetera, is in our financial statements. The CapEx is in our CapEx numbers, the depreciation is in our depreciation numbers. So what you'll see is when a higher ownership percentage, so there'll be less equity share growing out to minority shareholders on the P&L. And as Mark already mentioned, we'll have more trade revenue business. But the cost structure will be essentially the same cost structure. We'll have the chance to leverage up the revenue portion of that with a higher trade mix. The rest of the cost structure is essentially as it was.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Great, understood. If I could on another line, moving on to sort of a CapEx. You're holding your guidance at $2 billion for the year. Traditionally, we've sort of seen that to be more front half loaded. Again, it looks this year like that that's going to be the case, although given your spending in the first 2 quarters of the fiscal, it does look like we're going to sort of hold that line rather flat for the balance of the year. Is that sort of the way to think about it? Or are we not going to get a roll-off in the back half of the year?
Ronald C. Foster: Yes, as I mentioned, the -- 60% of our total CapEx budget was probably spent in the first quarter of this fiscal year, and it was related -- and into the second quarter, it was heavily related to the final payments -- build-out and payments on our IMFS capital. And as you heard the report on the ramp of that facility. So the remainder of the second half of the year is pretty low in the remaining balance, and it's going to be probably the $400 million range for the next couple of quarters.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Right. And I guess at that level, you'll have trouble getting to that $2 billion number, sort of, and it'll be underneath the $2 billion at that rate. That was what I was surprised by.
Ronald C. Foster: No, it'll be about $2 billion.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then I guess one for you, Mark. When I look at the operational expenses, a new high hit here in this quarter. How do I think about OpEx being sort of controlled going forward? And what are the puts and takes you look at when looking to invest on R&D or SG&A cost lines?
D. Mark Durcan: Yes, well, I think going forward, you should think in terms of R&D being relatively flat moving forward. We are adding, as I mentioned, some cleaner space on equipment in the R&D operation. But overall, we're also getting some efficiencies there. And I think you should -- and some roll-off relative to previous existing equipment. So I think you should think of R&D as flattish moving forward. Relative to the SG&A, there were a number -- as Ron noted, there are a number of onetime events that hit our SG&A line this quarter. And I think those are really much more onetime-type events, and you would anticipate us going back to something more along the lines of what you've historically seen on that line. Ron, did you want to add anything?
Ronald C. Foster: No, it's right on. I just want to -- I gave you the -- our view, $155 million to $165 million, which is sort of the typical range of SG&A. They were just blips in the quarter that affected the total cost by about $20 million.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: All right. And then the one market that you guys haven't given us an update on, or if I could get some more color on, I guess I'd ask, is on the wireless base. Clearly, the NOR side of the business struggling in that market. What's your outlook for sort of the build rate at your customers? Are we going to start to see sort of production levels on that side of the business pick up? How -- what's your demand outlook there?
Mark W. Adams: I think the demand outlook, if I understand your question, is still fairly positive. I think what you're seeing a little bit is the continued shift in mix towards the -- a higher percentage of smartphones as the overall product category. And so that's rewarding those with a portfolio that have a broad breadth of MCPs and MMC-type offerings. So -- and also, the customer concentration is different because people who were successful in smartphones weren't necessarily the leaders in the feature phone. So there's a lot of dynamics shifting. But I think overall, we still are very optimistic about the continued growth in that category.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I guess my first question, Mark, is given the increasing importance of mix, I'm assuming there are some quarters where you guys will have the opportunity to move mix to higher-profit areas and then other quarters either because of demand or customer needs, you won't be able to do that. I guess if you look at the fiscal third quarter, is the assumption I should be making is that these mix shifts are all moving toward higher-margin products? Or could you help me understand the puts and takes there from a product perspective?
D. Mark Durcan: I think obviously, there's a lot of puts and takes that get you to the aggregated view. But I think generally speaking, we're looking at a richer mix as we move into fiscal Q3, especially in DRAM.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And then, guys, my second question. And I apologize. I know you had talked about mobile RAM. What percent of revenue is it today? What would you expect it to be 12 months from now? And I guess the reason why I ask the question, it's clear, as we're moving from single core to kind of multi-core processors in things like smartphones and tablets, that memory density, CBRAM [ph] density is going up. And so I'm just trying to get a better sense of how big of a business is it today for you? Where do you think it can go? And is it above sort of corporate average margins? [ :p id="29457912" name="Mark Adams" type="E" /> Let me -- admittedly, I think we're probably behind in our participation in that category today. As I commented on, we think we're positioned pretty well technology-wise with 30-series coming out in the back half of the year. And I think industry dynamics are favoring that our customers are coming and leaning on us hard to get there quick because there are some scaled opportunities there from a volume standpoint. So I want to be careful not to start to share volumes numbers out per se, but we think it's going to be pretty significant by the end of this year or early next year.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And I think as my last question, just any updates you can give us, some kind of industry DRAM bit growth assumptions for the calendar 2012? And I guess given all the potential scenarios around Alpeta, how do we bracket the highs and lows around that estimate?
Kipp A. Bedard: John, it looks like, if you look at the third-party data, it's probably anywhere between, on a production basis, 30% to 35% bit growth in 2012.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Newman with Sanford C. Bernstein.
Mark C. Newman - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: A quick question first on the NAND pricing and demand side. How do you see that strengthening? Now obviously, we're still seeing some weakness right now. Just wondering when you'll see NAND pricing strengthen and then maybe looking forward, if you can make some comments on the supply side and how that's balancing with the demand in the second half of this year and into next year.
Mark W. Adams: The best way to characterize our position on that is we think that this a kind of an adjustment in terms of what's happened out of the SSD build from the Thailand situation, which we've commented on in the call today. We think it's a short-term phenomenon. We're pretty optimistic in the back half the year that the demand and supply balance in NAND will continue.
Mark C. Newman - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Great, that's fantastic. And a follow-up question on NAND. Obviously, you've got the deal with Intel shaping out. To better model that, can I get some estimate for the NAND on a volume basis, the percentage of your NAND business that is trade and how that will change going forward based on the Intel agreement?
Ronald C. Foster: Mark, this is Ron. We've -- I'm not going to break it down to a specific percentage, but we gave you a view of the Intel volume. It's going to be about the same in this quarter we're in right now. I wouldn't expect a big change with the transaction occurring, as Mark mentioned, in early April. Then it'll trend down a little bit. We'll be reporting the supply agreement portion as -- which has a profit margin, in our trade numbers. And so it will go up in the mix. But we'll certainly update you on that as we go forward. And you got a rough view for me of the wafer mix that is coming out from Micron as well.
Mark C. Newman - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. And then in terms of the trade gross margin that's coming from this Intel business, is it fair to assume that is obviously going to be more than the old Intel business, but less than the rest of your trade business? Is that a fair assumption?
Ronald C. Foster: We're not going to call out specific margin on an agreement like that.
Kipp A. Bedard: And I think we have time up for one more question.
Operator: Yes, sir. our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Barclays.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I guess first question, in terms of your trend NAND guide, I'm curious whether that's pro forma for the closure of the JV. Or is that something that could drive upside?
D. Mark Durcan: Did you want the trade NAND trend?
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Yes.
D. Mark Durcan: That is our prediction for trade production from Micron's trade business as I described it. As I just mentioned, we don't expect to see a big swing in the current quarter we're in right now, the third quarter.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And I guess as a follow-up, can you remind me in terms of what you're comfortable with in terms of leverage? You're a healthy $2.1 billion in cash, $2.2 billion in debt. How should we think about debt-to-kind of EBITDA and leverage go-forward? What you would be comfortable with at sort of the extreme?
Ronald C. Foster: Well, the communication that we've given fairly consistently is that we target over the long run to be in the 20% to 25% debt-to-capital range. Right now, we're running right at 20%. And that can, of course, vary with market cycles and with strategic decisions that we make in the business. But in general, the range we're comfortable with over the long run is in the -- the upper end will be the 25% kind of range over a long-term trend. But of course, that can vary in interim periods based upon market conditions and strategic decisions.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: That's helpful. I could sneak one last -- one in for Ron. When you guys turn profitable, what kind of share count should we be thinking about?
Ronald C. Foster: Well, we got -- you can see from our converts that some of them kick in at profit levels. For example, at $60 million net income, one of our converts kicks into the measurement, et cetera, and then a couple of more at $200 million kind of profit range. So the dilution affects from the converts would come in at those kind of income levels.
Kipp A. Bedard: And with that, we'd like to thank everyone for participating on the call today. If you'll please bear with me, I need to repeat the Safe Harbor protection language.

Steven R. Appleton: Thanks, Kipp. I'm going to make a few comments around operations technology and on a couple of activities in the business units, and then I'm going to turn it over to Ron to cover on financials and then we'll open it up for questions. So starting out around the technology, we're going to make a few highlights about some of the things we achieved in the quarter. We were able to introduce the world's first 128-gigabit Marvell-ethic [ph] NAND device, which uses Micron's 20-nanometer NAND process. And if you remember, I commented on it last quarter. And on a related note, we are now in mass production of 64-gigabit product using this process as well. So I think the team has done a great job on getting that into production and getting the product out.  We also started production our first 45-nanometer NOR products for the embedded applications. And as I'll comment later in ESG, that's also going well.  I wanted to point out that we've had a lot of success in working with customers. And if you've seen it from some of the more recent media, we've introduced the Hybrid Memory Cube. And obviously, we're working in concert with Intel on bringing that to a lot of applications out in the space. And just also probably know, this device can improve bandwidth really by more than 15X and needs about 7% less power than you'd get from today's DDR3 modules. So it really does bring a lot of performance to the marketplace.  On the operations side, IMFS continues to ramp and perform well. As we had mentioned the last quarter, I think within a month, we should be at full wafer starts. It's all going really according to plan, better than planned. And as Ron will comment on more later, this facility has been ramping on our MLC technology. So I'd just point out that, obviously, that helps us a lot on the cost, but a lot of that product by virtue of the channel that goes into also lowers the average ASP for those, for the overall NAND bit. But there's 2 really, 2 good things that are embedded [ph]. We're ramping very successfully and it's resulting in a lot of bits being produced in that space. Other -- one of the item worth noting is on 30-nanometer DRAM. We spoke about that before. It's in yearly ramp, it's going well at both Virginia and in Ontario. And related to that on the CapEx front, I just want to highlight that we came in about $750 million for the quarter. If you'll recall, it's a little bit lighter than we probably thought. But I do want to confirm that we intend on holding the target at around $2 billion for the fiscal year. And our plan is lined up pretty well with that.  A comment on a few of the business segments. The DRAM Solutions Group, you also recall the last earnings discussion, we noted the continued weakness in DRAM market and really not much has changed. This is again mostly being reflected in the consumer markets, in particular, PCs. I will highlight that the hard drive supply issues that everyone is aware of, we think it's dropped the DRAM demand somewhere 10% to 15%. Now obviously, that's temporary, but it definitely had an impact. On the bright side, especially DRAM, particularly our growth in the market looks good. Our bit shipped into this space were up over 30% quarter-over-quarter. And on a positive note, the New Zealand supply continues to be muted compared to last cycle. If you look at in the media announcements lately, you'll know that some of the capacity has taken offline. I think we're hopeful and I think we believe that the supply and demand equation as we move into the next year should be pretty good, particularly if we have any demand creation at all.  In the wireless segment, you can see from our business unit financial summary that this group continues to gain a lot of pressure. Really, there's no improvement in the quarter we're in. I think it's obvious from what's going on in the marketplace that a couple of our customers continue to have challenges there.  On the embedded front, however, it's been pretty good. Again, it's pretty stable, as we would expect. Revenues were up about 8%, and that was primarily led by automotive applications, where we happen to believe that Micron is really a supplier of choice now. So we think we're in good shape there. As I mentioned earlier, we started shipping our 45-nanometer NOR into a number of Japanese gaming applications. So that's also gone well.  On the NAND front, the NAND Solutions Group on the NSG front, we've had a pretty strong quarter. The market highlight continues to be our progress in the solid-state drive space. Interesting enough, about 1/4 of our NAND bits are now going into this application. Obviously, there'll be an impact a little bit with your [indiscernible] coming out at IMFS. But that's really a good story for us. In fact, our quarter-over-quarter growth for SSD was almost 60%. So that's -- as we had referenced last time continuing to grow in a very good state. In fact, in the client category, we have design wins really at all of the large PC OEMs. In the enterprise space were well aligned with several of the top storage OEM guys. And we're expecting a pretty robust ramp during the 2012 market, as we move into next year. So with that, I want to turn it over to Ron.
Ronald C. Foster: Thanks, Steve. The company's first quarter of fiscal 2012 ended on December 1. As usual, we provide a schedule containing certain key results for the quarter, as well as certain guidance for the next quarter. That material is presented on a few slides that follow, as well as on our website. Total sales for the first quarter were relatively flat compared to the prior quarter, with NAND growth being offset by a decline in wireless NOR sales.  Similar to the prior quarter, the first quarter resulted in a net loss primarily as a result of weakness in the DRAM markets, particularly for PC DRAM products as Steve mentioned. Although average selling prices declined for both DRAM and NAND, we continue to leverage our broad product portfolio to achieve selling prices at a premium to the industry average. This is primarily a result of our mix of products sold in the premium server specialty DRAM, SLC and SSD applications, as Steve referred to.  In the first quarter, NAND revenue increased 6% and continued to outgrow DRAM sales, which were flat compared to the prior quarter. On the P&L, the equity and income loss from equity method investees primarily reflects our share of Inotera's net loss for the period. To help facilitate Inotera's investments required to transition to our 30-nanometer process technology, subsequent to the first quarter, we lent Inotera $133 million in a short-term 90-day note. Inotera plans to replace this note with a longer-term financing with one or more partners in the March timeframe.  Our Singapore IM Flash fab continues to make outstanding progress on its production ramp, which is several months ahead of the original schedule. In fact, at the end of the quarter, wafer output from the Singapore fab reached the target level for its original ramp. Product yields during this ramping phase approached maturity levels, which enabled the Singapore operation to achieve very low bit cost at the end of the quarter.  While Micron's ownership of the Singapore operation is at 82%, during the first quarter, we took about 65% of the capacity in accordance with the agreements. We expect to take approximately 78% of the capacity from IM Flash Singapore in the second quarter. The output from the IM Flash U.S. operations remains consistent at the initial 51, 49 ownership split.  Trade NAND bit sales to Micron customers grew 21% in the first quarter, as IM Flash Singapore ramped production at the same time our output share increased. The initial production at the Singapore operation is MLC NAND, as Steve commented. Accordingly, the Q1 sales volume had a higher concentration of MLC products compared to SLC. Since MLC per bit selling prices are significantly lower than SLC, our average NAND bit selling prices declined in the first quarter, lower than the industry average. However, the higher Singapore production volume and lower cost of MLC products in the first quarter combined the yield 16% lower bit production cost in trade NAND, which outpaced the market price declines and the effect of the SLC to MLC mix shift. We expect similar output and cost improvements as the ramp continues over the next couple of quarters.  Quarter-to-date, average selling prices for trade NAND, adjusted for the higher MLC mix, are running down high teens compared to the average for the first quarter. Flat DRAM revenue in the first quarter reflects bit sales volume growth offset by declines in average selling prices. DRAM bit output is expected to continue double-digit growth in the second quarter, as Inotera volume continues to grow with their improving yields, along with continued migration to advance process technologies at our other fabs. Cost reductions will keep pace in the high single to low double-digit range.  Quarter-to-date, average selling prices, adjusted per mix, are down in the low 20% range compared to the first quarter average. As Steve mentioned, SSD sales in the NSG business unit grew over 40% quarter-to-quarter, and it constituted 13% of our trade NAND sales in the first quarter. Including component sales to fabless SSD customers. We estimate our total sales into the SSD market during the first quarter at about 30% of our trade NAND sales. IM Flash sales to Intel were $261 million in the first quarter and are expected to be relatively flat in the second quarter.  Our Wireless Solutions Group was impacted by weakness in the wireless NOR market. In response to this weakness and to better manage the level of inventories, we reduced production in our 200-millimeter NOR fabs. Total idle capacity charges in the first quarter were $44 million, which was largely comprised of charges from the NOR fabs that impacted both WSG and ESG operating results. We call it idle capacity charges are a direct cogs charge rather than valued in inventory and recognized when the product is sold. We expect these idle capacity charges to continue in the second quarter with seasonal weakness in the NOR products.  SG&A expense in the first quarter was down slightly compared to the previous quarter and is expected to be roughly flat for the fiscal year 2012 year-over-year. R&D expense for the first quarter of $230 million was higher than the previous quarter, due to higher volumes of development wafers processed and the timing of production qualifications. R&D expense is expected to be in the same range in the second quarter and then trend down for the remainder of the fiscal year. The company generated $404 million in cash flow from operating activities in the first quarter and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.9 billion. Expenditures for PP&E were $746 million for the first quarter, and we reiterate the estimated expenditures for the fiscal year at $2 billion, as Steve commented, the largest category pertaining to equipment acquisitions for IMFS.  During the first quarter, we executed lease financing arrangements that sourced $110 million in cash, more than offsetting the $48 million in payments for normal debt amortization in the quarter. With that, I'll close and turn it back to Kipp.
Kipp A. Bedard: Thanks, Ron. We would like now to take questions from callers. [Operator Instructions]. And with that, please open the line.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James Schneider of Goldman Sachs.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: First of all, in the DRAM side, I was wondering if you can give us any kind of sense at all, ballpark, what would DRAM prices have to do from here for DRAM Solutions Group to turn profitable on an operating basis?
Ronald C. Foster: I think we're going to defer from answering that kind of a question that gets too close to gross margins, and I don't know any DRAM company that gives those out.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, fair enough. Could you maybe give us an update then on what you expect your bit growth in both DRAM and NAND to be in 2012?
Ronald C. Foster: Well, as we look sort of quarter-to-quarter, I think you can expect DRAM bit growth will be averaging, yes, mid to high teens in the short term and then down from there later in the year.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Do you still expect to be able to basically be above 40% for 2012 on a year-over-year basis?
Ronald C. Foster: Yes, I think that's a good number.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Pitzer of Crédit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: A couple of questions. First on the CapEx, can you talk a little bit about why you came in a little bit light this quarter and then you're still sticking to the $2 billion for the fiscal year. I was kind of curious as sometimes how we should think about when you already throughout the fiscal year [ph] quarters?
Steven R. Appleton: It's really just timing.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And then when you already kept it, you basically just amortize the [indiscernible] in the 3 quarters? Or is there going to be some lumpiness within those quarters?
Ronald C. Foster: I think that the simplest way to characterize it is, we had a lot of equipment that we had to finish paying for in IMFS. And that kind of carries through our Q1 and our Q2. It gotten -- some of it got pushed out from Q1 to Q2. So Q2 is going to be a little bit higher than maybe we thought it would be, because Q1 is a little bit lower, but in Q3 and Q4 is about the same. I mean, basically, if you think about it, we just say we did $750 million. I don't know what the number is exactly for Q2, but it's probably going to be somewhere in the $500 million range and then you can split the $800 million between the last 2 quarters.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Ron, in the DRAM business, you talked a little bit about how -- whether or not you've been successful moving mix towards server DRAMs, specifically in Inotera, maybe help us understand what percent of the DRAM business now is going to servers and what about my guests?
Ronald C. Foster: Today, if you look at our specialty business defined as servers, networking and storage, that number is roughly 30% of those DRAM bits are going into those segments. And to your point, I think the growth there, we have continued upside for us going forward.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And I think my last question, Steve. I think a lot of investors I've talked to are wondering whether or not there's the consolidation events coming down the pipeline. I wonder if you could just speak a little bit in the sort of year-over-year on consolidation, kind of what looks sort of attractive as you think longer term and I guess importantly the biggest issue with consolidation is comprised with some buyer and seller agree and kind of curious on your view around valuations?
Steven R. Appleton: Yes. Well, obviously we wouldn't comment on anything we're thinking about or engaging in. But I will say that the DRAM market, the industry in general has been under a lot of pressure. You can look at the financial results of the number of these companies. In fact, if you look at our last quarter compared to the close of a couple of our competitors. I think LP lost about $500 million, $600 million; [indiscernible] lost about $500 million. And obviously, we're not happy to be losing any money, but it's certainly not better than what their financials look like. And I think that a number of those companies continue to weaken. As they do continue to weaken, they're going to have to figure out what they're going to do. And so I think that will drive some further consolidation. I think that's inevitable. And so we're just going to continue to look at whatever opportunities might exist out there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Monica [ph] with Pacific Crest.
Unknown Analyst: I had a question regarding the equity line item. So that loss was about $74 million for this quarter higher than the previous quarter of $40 million, whereas your DRAM business was essentially unchanged. So trying to understand why the Inotera loss was much bigger number for this quarter?
Ronald C. Foster: This is Ron. That line is for situations where we make equity investments that's noncontrolling investments. In other companies, the largest part of the equity loss there is related to Inotera, about $74 million in the quarter. And there are other equity investments that also had some net loss effective and majority of that total was Inotera. We do actually report that on a 2-month lag basis based upon their financial reports. So as you track their financial reports, we own about 30% of Inotera. And that 30% of our net loss flows through our statements for the 2-month lag.
Unknown Analyst: Just one more question here. Could you give us or provide some idea on the contract pricing in the DRAM market right now? Like how is it trending compared to what market? Is it below, higher or in line?
Ronald C. Foster: Yes, sure. The contract pricing is above the spot market today and has been for the past few months. I think consistent with Steve just referenced in terms of the health of the industry. I think OEMs have to be a little careful on how hard they push given the supply from some of the more challenged competitors ability to consistently supply in the future. So I think contracts will stay that way as best as we can see in the short term. Having said that, the spot market pricing within the last couple of weeks had a mild uptick. And when I say mild, I mean, in a given week, it was up from a low down step about 15% and then settle down a little bit. But it's still above where we were at the end of the quarter. And so we think the OEM contract pricing will stay above that and again, the spot market has bounced little bit incrementally higher, but not to a place where we need to get to.
Unknown Analyst: Okay. Just last one. Is it possible to provide [ph] an idea how much is 30-nanometer makes for DRAM?
Ronald C. Foster: Yes, it's still less than 10% of our volume.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shawn Webster of Macquarie.
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research: So you shared with us some of the bit shipment that you had in fiscal Q1. You just reported a quarter. I was wondering if you could share with us what your bit production was for both DRAM and NAND?
Ronald C. Foster: Sure, Shawn. In Q1, DRAM was up in the 20% plus range on production and trade NAND was up high single-digits.
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then on the consolidation question. I was wondering was there anything that prevents Nanya from partnering with another DRAM supplier in terms of the relationship that Micron has with them?
Ronald C. Foster: We have you pretty close and injured relationship with Nanya that involves joint development. And obviously, there are things that both partners are allowed to do and not allowed to do relative to where they take that technology. So that would be clearly an impediment to them partnering with somebody else in DRAM area.
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then maybe one last one. Can you give us some color on inventories, where there look lean, where they look light, maybe how many weeks that you're seeing that channel on the DRAM on the NAND side?
Ronald C. Foster: Sure. On the DRAM side, I think there are some correction and healthy correction that's going on in the channel. I think what Steve alluded to earlier around the hard drive situation out of Thailand, I think most of the channel and the OEMs are pretty aggressive in tracking inventories for their year end. So we still think there's some DRAM in the channel, but not too much. I think it's in a healthy place. On the NAND side, I think NAND, if anything, is below a healthy level. And I think that's driven by a lot of the reaction around the need for SSDs. Our inventories and our channel partner inventories are pretty light there. So I would say that DRAM still has some room to be managed downward into a 3- to 4-week. I think it's probably more in the 4- to 5-week area today. But I think, overall, I don't think it's out of hand. I think it's well under control. I think people manage around the Thailand issue and I think there to a pretty good place.
Operator: Next question comes from Daniel Berenbaum from MKM partners.
Daniel A. Berenbaum - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division: I wanted to follow up on the prior question of consolidation, realizing that you don't want to comment specifically. But maybe can you help us understand circumstances under which it might be appealing to you to be an acquirer as you have been in the past? When would it be beneficial for you to try to take out either a major competitor or one of the production partners of a major competitor? Or are you simply more interested in focusing on lowering your own cost base, your competitors continue to burn cash?
Ronald C. Foster: That's pretty all-inclusive question you had there, Daniel.
Daniel A. Berenbaum - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division: I tried to capture it all in one.
Steven R. Appleton: Yes, I think that, first and foremost, if you look at what we've been in the past, we like to think that we've been fairly intelligent around the economics of our prior activities here. When we did the Numonyx, we -- I think it's very good for us, the cash generated in the short term was high, and we basically got a payback in a short period of time. When we did things like all the way back to the particular [ph] stage. We look at the ability of the assets to produce, you look at the replacement cost of those assets. And then we look at what our ability is in terms of productivity of those assets, and we obviously economic on that and to determine what the appropriate value is. So I do think you should expect us to do anything different than that. I think that we really have been the only catalysts and consolidators in the main memory arena that's been successful at M&A in terms of, in other words, not only acquiring, but also being able to integrate and then make those assets productive. And so we'll continue to look at our ability to do that. There are some cases where that just wasn't possible and we've seen a company or 2 either exit the business or in [indiscernible] case, they were bankrupt. And there was just really no economic model that made sense for us. And so I think that, that's how we're going to evaluate it. And if there's something that it make sense, whether that look. And if we can get it in a form that we think is, I think, appreciative in terms of how we view assets and the cost of assets or how we view our ability to produce cash flow, we weren't going to do something. But if we think we can, were going to take a hard look.
Daniel A. Berenbaum - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then just to follow up on the funding in Inotera. The past, you've been very reluctant to do this. I recognize this is only a 90-day note. But is there something that has change there, is there something we need to be more concerned about there?
Ronald C. Foster: No. The money going in is really just to make sure that Inotera has the wherewithal to execute on the 30-nanometer DRAM ramp we talked about. And we think that this money allows them to move forward with order and the tools they need to begin with that ramp. And our financing that was referenced that will go on in the spring is what will be necessary in order to put that entity financial putting to move through the rest of the fiscal year.
Operator: Next question we'll hear is from Glen Yeung of Citi.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: This is the first question. It's a clarification. Did you say you actually saw an uptick in SSD demands because of their hard drive shortage?
Steven R. Appleton: Yes. We absolutely did. I think if I were to separate out the consumer side of that versus the corporate side of that, consumer is very strong. And I think the corporate side was a little bit more conservative in their growth, but still grew some as well. But absolutely, I think the PC guys did as much as they could. Remember, this happened during a very -- what was normally a strong seasonal demand period for them right in the middle of shipping into the channel for the holidays. And obviously, the end of year budget in the commercial environment. So we saw a pretty strong uptick, more attracted to the consumer side of the business. I think the corporate environment had the ability to put off additional spend per unit if they had to. But overall, it was a very positive impact on the SSD demands.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. So I have 2 questions associated with that, then. So why is as we move into the first half of 2012 and the hard drive issue starts to lessen, do you think that you will see an uptick in PC DRAM demand even though we're in a seasonally soft period. In other words, is there not pent up demand to overcome seasonal softness? And then secondly related to that is, if the SSD increase that you saw to go backwards, just one of the things that people go back to using SSDs as they become more available?
Steven R. Appleton: So I think the way we're looking at it is that on the DRAM side, it should be fair, but we're hearing the same things that you're hearing, that it's not the fall which is the first data points that we're getting from the channel. It's more likely early spring kind of a recovery on the hard drive, worse case. So if that's the case, where we see DRAM demand from that sector stabilizing and being more attractive. I think the second question around SSD, I think it's interesting. As I said, the consumer side, once people go over it, is not easy to go back and I think as long as they could hit the right price points to match the consumers' appetite, I think you'll see that has proven to be kind of an unforecasted catalyst for SSD adoption. But I don't think that means that hard drives aren't going back in some of the configuration. I think hard drives will recover in the back end. I think it's just that actually on SSDs alone a very opportunistic way to get more of that product demand for customers.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Last question is just on the enterprise side. Just your senses, I know you guys have a little bit of viewpoint here, but just your sense on the relative strength of enterprise-related demand?
Steven R. Appleton: Is that specific to SSD or just in general?
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: No, just in general.
Steven R. Appleton: Actually, if you -- it's pretty favorable. If you look at our technology that we sell into those markets, the enterprise segments are performing fairly well and the demand relatively strong. And we talked about the server performance, and I think that continues to be pretty good for us. The networking segments been pretty good for us. So -- and storage, of course, is now, is becoming more and more of a place where we could fill our products and draw our portfolio to sort of -- we're fairly positive on enterprise in general and our exposure continues to grow in the good way.
Operator: The next question comes from Stephen Cassidy of Stifel, Nicolaus.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: It's Kevin Cassidy. But I was just wondering how you see the changes in the market with Apple buying Anobit?
Steven R. Appleton: Well, I mean it's certainly something that we've talked about on prior calls that beyond the NAND, there's a lot of investment going on in terms of controller development. And even on top of that, software and firmware enhancements of the application and performance requirements needed. So certainly, I think Apple obviously has the largest product consumer of NAND capacity for their products. It makes a lot of sense for them to go out and invest in these types of areas to enhance their products and enhance the performance of their products. Obviously, they still need NAND supply at the core technology level to be able to enable their products. And I think they're trying to balance out their portfolio to be able to optimize that NAND to drive the requirements of their products and the features going forward.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: right. So your sale to Apple, you don't see a lot of changes happening?
Ronald C. Foster: We don't anticipate the demand from Apple to change at all.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And how about for your own Controller strategy? I know you use a wide range of controllers. Are you making any changes there?
Steven R. Appleton: Well, I think that we continue to evaluate the technology around controllers and any of the capabilities around the NAND, because what this stands -- in the market today, there's a lot of startup technology that companies that are working on projects around surrounding the NAND. And as this happens, and the venture community continues to invest in these types of companies, picking the winners and losers is not so easy. We've looked in a bunch of companies and over time, we've seen companies who started fast and didn't materialize as well in terms of getting technology to the market. So we continue to evaluate who are the right partners. Having said that, we're not announcing anything material in terms of partnerships that we haven't already commented on in the press.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. Maybe just one other question about, how do you view increasing capacity again? Wafer out for NAND Flash?
Ronald C. Foster: Well, really, our CapEx plan, as we commented on, is pretty much set for fiscal 2012. That has us plateau-ing for NAND at this roughly 65,000 wafer per month level at IMFS. And anything we did incrementally in the short term would be in terms of our own existing operations as opposed to incremental wafers in the short term. When we get near the end of 2012, that'll be a good time to look at what the right next step, obviously, on an IMFS operation.
Ronald C. Foster: Kevin, were you also asking about the industry or just Micron?
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: No, just Micron was viewing us. Maybe you can comment on the industry, that'd be interesting also.
Ronald C. Foster: Well, it's probably, I don't think the industry has much of a different approach from us. We had these incremental capacity announced that we put on the roadmap. And most seem be kind of stopping where they're at and see how the market looks when I go beyond it.
Operator: The next question comes from Sidney Ho of Nomura Securities.
Sidney Ho - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: For Inotera, there are some chatters that they will come back on production. And at the Analyst Day, I think you guys are talking about running at 120, 130K wafers per month through 2012. Can you talk about the production plan now maybe. It doesn't sound like it's going down based on what to give in terms of guidance earlier?
Ronald C. Foster: I think we're going to let Inotera speak for Inotera and that's for the total volume for the 2 partners. Micron doesn't have any plans to cut any output relative to share currently.
Sidney Ho - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Okay, great. And then secondly, you guys talked about a 20-nanometer NAND part using high-k/metal gate. I have to assume the cost is higher, given the material and maybe more R&D. So 2 questions here: First, relative to the cost of a light-colored pure die shrink without the new material, do you have any data to compare the cost and performance? And second longer term, does it give you better performance on maybe extend the life of plain floating gate and beyond, say, 50 nanometers?
Ronald C. Foster: Sorry, I missed the very beginning of your question, which was an announcement by whom?
Sidney Ho - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Oh, you guys talk about -- you guys talked about 20 nanometers NAND components using high-k/metal gate.
Ronald C. Foster: Yes, so anytime we introduce a new technology, there's new capital investment and there's lower utilization as you ramp production. So initial cost tend to be a little higher on the new technology node on the wafer -- at the wafer level and then those come down in the line overtime as equipment gets fully utilized. There's nothing significant about the high-k/metal gate as a new technology node that puts it completely out of proportion for what you would typically see moving from one technology node to another to the other neither NAND -- not an abnormal increment relatively for cost incurred that way.  So then the second piece of the question is, well, what about performance. Performance in NAND is a tricky thing, as these flowing gates keep scaling down more and more. We're obviously challenged to make sure that we have both good retention as well as good cycling characteristics. And what you've seen is that those Windows have narrowed as technology nodes have continued to shrink. And what the trick is to use advanced technology and new materials to try and continue to slow the rate of decrease in performance as you continue to scale devices and be able to build higher density and deliver better value for the dollar. So yes, we think this is the right answer. That's why we're doing it. Do we see any long-term issues associated with the reliability of the device? Absolutely not. We think that this is the right way to scale from 25 nanometers to 20 nanometers. And we probably got few tricks up our sleeves to move on beyond that.
Operator: The next question comes from David Wong of Wells Fargo.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Clarification of your earlier part. You were talking about hard disk drive supply issues. Have you seen any pickup in DRAM bit demand as we've seen this drive production come online in Thailand over the last few weeks?
Steven R. Appleton: The timing isn't fantastic given that the holiday purchasing and manufacturing is pretty much done. Having said that the only data point we do have that could speak to that would be the large uptick in the channel or spot market. We had about -- last week, we had about a 15% increase in spot pricing. It's settled down a little bit, but it came back down 5% of that uptick. And that's about the only index I could say that suggests the DRAM NAND is normalizing around what would have been the typical holiday demand without Thailand. And then, by the way, that's speaks to my inventory comment earlier, which that as hard drives came back in, it's not like there's a bunch of DRAM in the channel that we're concerned about. I mean, it might be modestly above norm, but not -- some of it's out of control. We think that the OEMs that reacted pretty strongly, and that hurt demand in Q1 for us. And I think the channel as well reacted fairly well and quickly on it.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Great. And my other question is, when you're seeing solid-state drives used in consumer PCs today, what's the range of capacity of solid-state drives that are typically manufactured or putting into these PCs and what is the cost of these SSDs to manufacturers?
Steven R. Appleton: I'll let someone else talk at the cost data. But on the density, typical density is about 128 to 256. There's different manufacturers who had different numbers that they're using for densities. But somewhere in that range, you may see some entry-level SSD around 64-gig. But primarily, on average, the industry average is about 150. But the [indiscernible] range is between 128 and 256.
Operator: The next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Stern Agee.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Just with the NAND side, I know you mentioned pricing was down with the mix. What is the SLC and MLC mix in the quarter and where do you see it going?
Ronald C. Foster: So SLC is mid-teens, and it'll probably stay in that range here, as we move through the rest of the year.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Right. And you mentioned SSD is now about 30% of the trade NAND. I'll give that probably about 10% of your overall revenues then. Just wondering what's the mix of enterprise and consumer in that SSD and what are you seeing there between [indiscernible]?
Ronald C. Foster: Today, it's primarily a client with a little adoption on the enterprise side. I think that most analysts are forecasting that while the dollars will be relatively close, the units will be somewhere in the 80% range for client and 20% enterprise. And again, the dollar forecast is much closer to an even split. I don't know that it will get to even. But I think they're suggesting that the enterprise dollars will be 45% or 50% of the overall SSD dollar share and clients will be similar.
Unknown Analyst: All right. And last question here, when you look at the, just CapEx for the industrial, where do you see CapEx going for DRAM and NAND in 2012 for the industry?
Ronald C. Foster: Well, I don't think there's any question that CapEx is going to come down for DRAM in particular. It's likely that it will also be offloaded for NAND. It's always hard to say. We're still in 2011. I don't know if it's, it tends to adapt realtime, compared to the market conditions are. So I think given the current market conditions and I think it's inevitable we'll come down. It's hard to tell right now.
Operator: The next question is from Hans Mosesmann of Raymond James.
Brian C. Peterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: This is Brian Peterson filling in for Hans. Just a question on your Embedded Solutions Group. Your revenue there has been pretty stable over the last 4 or 5 quarters, but margins have continued to come down. Can you just talk to some of the drivers there?
Steven R. Appleton: Sure. I lost the last part of the question. Can you restate that?
Brian C. Peterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Yes, just looking for some of the drivers of the margin erosion in the Embedded Solutions Group.
Steven R. Appleton: Well, I think that the some of that has to do with the types of products that are going to embedded. We don't think it's going to be a material margin impact. Some of it has to do, as I said, with more DRAM being sold into that market share. And actually, we think that's a positive long term as we sell the whole portfolio to that segment. As a matter of fact, I think quarter-over-quarter, the number is 42% growth in of DRAM into the embedded customer base. And that better margin that we would normally have gotten in the commodity space. So if the portfolio started playing out a little bit, and bringing down the ESG margin somewhat, but again, positive overall to our performance.
Brian C. Peterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay, fair enough. And just to follow up on Inotera. I know that's a short-term financing to get them through to 30 nanometers. But how would you handle a situation potentially if they could not finance or put that out to another third party?
Steven R. Appleton: It's pretty hard to respond to hypotheticals, so I think we'll pass on that one.
Operator: Our next question will come from Ryan Goodman with CLSA.
Ryan Goodman - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division: I had a question on comment you made early on the call about several OEM wins on the client side of SSDs. Just looking for some color and then maybe you could share the split between the client business there between channel and OEM exactly?
Steven R. Appleton: Sure, sure. I think to that point on prior calls, I've talked about the channel opportunity in SSDs relative to OEMs. And as we continue to grow, we're expecting equal growth, really. It's about split down the middle between our channel drive under the crucial brands as well as our OEM design on the Micron brand of products. And today, that's about a 50-50 split. And so off of the last quarter numbers, we've been growing share in OEM as part of our mix. And they're both categories growing very nicely for us.
Ryan Goodman - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division: And just follow up to that, when can we start seeing some ultra books out there with Micron driving them?
Steven R. Appleton: I hesitate to give you an exact date, but we think in the back half of the year, you'll see that.
Ryan Goodman - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division: And if I could put one more quick, just on the SSD roadmap. Can you give us an update on -- I know the PCI is sampling -- the MLC enterprise I think just went to production in the insider. Can you give us just timing on those 3 SKUs?
Steven R. Appleton: So I think all of which are quite of different answers to where we are in the qualification process of our customers and that volume should be. Probably I would leave it with that.
Operator: Our next question is from Bobby Gujavarty of Deutsche Bank.
Bobby Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I was just curious on the NAND side between -- did you see strength in both kind of the OEM and the retail? I mean, there have some mixed data points on retail sales. Just curious what you think throughout [ph] those -- sort of throughout that markets did in the November quarter?
Steven R. Appleton: I think that we saw a fairly good retail numbers coming out of the holidays, meaning out of the holiday selling period. And even up till now, Black Friday, flash memory sales were pretty strong. And they've done fairly well above our plan. But we still see more demand growth coming out of the SSD kind of channel integrated of our business and then the client side. So what we've been pleasantly surprised at was the retail piece as we thought maybe that might be challenged, given overall retail and consumer appetite. But both have performed well. The growth of percentages would lead one to look at the SSD as a higher growth story. But overall, they both have done fairly well.
Bobby Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Great. Just maybe a quick follow up on that. NAND is traditionally a pretty seasonal business in terms of going ahead again for the calendar 1Q. But you have several offsets here obviously with SSDs. And then also just that you haven't had the same kind of retail balance in the back half of the year as you have traditionally in the end markets. Kind of what do you think about seasonalities as we head into the calendar 1Q. You're feeling better about NAND, about neutral or worse, just kind of curious?
Steven R. Appleton: I agree with where you're going. I think that NAND, if you look back 3 to 5 years ago, NAND was primarily driven in consumer products and MP3 players, USB drives, photography cards. If you get tied to cameras, that were bought in season. So I think there was a shift going on away from the seasonality factor around NAND. And SSDs and the fact that it's a new technology and being adopted and enterprises starting to get going. So I think you'll see a lot seasonality around NAND than we have in the past.
Operator: Our next question comes from Uche Orji from UBS.
Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: This is Steven calling in behalf of Uche. The first question I have was on the specialty memory business. In terms of the actually going to the server, as well as the mobile space, how was the pricing trends for that business, first of all, in fiscal Q1? And what does that so far in fiscal Q2 quarter-to-date?
Steven R. Appleton: So we don't normally break out the segment pricing at that level. Just a general comment for your modeling is that the commodity pricing tends to go in a direction and the other market segments on a proportional basis trail that trend. So it kind of maps out in the same direction, but not at the same rate.
Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I guess with some of your peers having increased capacity into a target for the specialty market, I was just wondering if there's, if you've seen any acceleration in price declines for the overall specialty business in the past several quarters or is that sort of containing of fairly steady decline rate?
Steven R. Appleton: Yes, on a relative basis, we see that. We haven't seen any impact from additional competitive capacity that we would isolate as a cause for anything abnormal.
Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, got it. And then for the 30-nanometer customer in DRAM, what kind of mix do you think that can achieve overall for fiscal 2012?
Steven R. Appleton: We're probably going to target around 30% conversion somewhere in the summer timeframe.
Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Got it. And then lastly, on the NAND business, for solid-state drives, is that a business that you think of doubling again in terms of revenues or sort of for full fiscal year? And if so, what kind of implications does it have on your IMFS expansion plans sort of towards the back half of the year?
Steven R. Appleton: I'll take the first part of that question. I think absolutely, we feel that has the opportunity to double. And as I mentioned, the OEM's success we think will continue to expand and grow, not just in the client space, but we think enterprise will be material to us, as well as, again sounding like I'm repeating myself here but the channel storage business is a pretty strong play for us. And the fact that we have half of our drive is going in the channel today, we'll tell you that we are pretty focused on winning that segment as well.
Ronald C. Foster: Relative to the second piece of the equation, I think does a lot of things that go in the hopper when you add new capacity. And we're certainly very encouraged with the directions, as Mark just commented, but we'll have to take a little bit of a wait-and-see approach.
Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I have an excellent quick follow up on that. Just for the different types of NAND products that you sell, your chips into between your retail branded SSDs versus the private label products versus cards and then on one in, what sort of the pecking order in terms of the most attractive from a profitability standpoint?
Steven R. Appleton: Let me give you more of an industry take on it as far as where the projections are in terms of ASPs, and we don't normally comment on that. But it's an attractiveness for longer-term margin opportunities in the industry. We think enterprise storage historically and will continue to be a very attractive space for us. We think client SSDs, given the performance requirements people are looking at it and endurance will continue to be a good space. We think there are mobile applications that will be more embedded. We also been doing in our ESG business, there will be custom specialty NAND applications that will develop and be somewhat attractive relative to more commoditized things like USB products or micro SD cards. So kind of a rough sketch of how we look at it.
Operator: The next question is from Doug Freedman with RBC Capital.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I was wondering if you could clarify something for me. On the NAND side, you offered an ASP erosion that included mixed shift. What was the ASP erosion on just the MLC like for like, quarter-to-quarter then?
Ronald C. Foster: Virtually all of it, all the change from Q4 to Q1, Doug, was mixed related.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: So you would call MLC would've been flat MLC?
Ronald C. Foster: Well, uplift in certain markets like SLC type NAND and then, of course, some retail drop. So you can't do a one-to-one on the all parts. But with the mix all in, ASPs were relatively flat and it was just a matter of shipping more SLC that drove the 10% down.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then if I look at the NAND market, can you offer a bit growth for the year on what you think the industry will do?
Ronald C. Foster: We think the industry, Doug, is going to come down a little bit in 2012. Certainly, in line of Steve's comment, where spending to be down by $1.5 billion as well. So it looks like the markets coming in around a 65% year-over-year growth rate.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And then when we talk about, you mentioned already the impact of disk drives on the PC build rates, do you think that we've seen the worst already? Or is the PC unit production going to decline materially in Q1 due to continued drive shortage? What's your outlook there in the near term? Where are we in that recovery?
Ronald C. Foster: I can give you a little bit of that, Doug, and then Mark can jump in if he likes. It looks like they're going to improve drive production by about 20 million units in Q1 over Q4. So if all those get put in boxes and those boxes get shipped and then you should see a better quarter. Mark, would you like to add anything to that?
Mark W. Adams: That's about what we're hearing from our major OEM customers is that they deal the worst is behind them in terms of the ability to get supply. And certainly the Tier-1 OEMs were able to put a lot of pressure on their suppliers to get them first in line. So we think that in Q1 calendar year, we'll see some normalization around PC shipments.
Ronald C. Foster: I probably have one more thing too. Don't forget that the SSD capacity can increase as well. I think Mark mentioned it in some of his comments, that we actually maxed out our SSD shipments. So we're adding production capacity. So SSDs will be able to ship in to those clients as well.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And then if I could just move on to the specialty memory, the server side of the market. Is there any signs that you're feeling any impact from the pending launch of Romley either any sort of a pause? Or is there an expectation of mixed shift that you're going to see that's driven by the Romley ramp? Can you talk about how you're preparing for that and what you're seeing in the market?
Ronald C. Foster: If anything we said the latter might be true, that there might be a potential mixed shift over time. We're seeing the server business change only in terms of the demand from our customers in terms of the type of lead times. That business is becoming more of a business that we have to plan strategically with inventory to react to increase opportunities. Server growth is fairly stable for us and in the industry. But the way these orders are coming in, there's an acronym in the industry called LVO for large volume orders, and they come in somewhat with very short lead times. These are data center applications when you think of companies like Google and Facebook and others and those supporting those types of businesses, and we have to react more strategically with strong inventory positions to take upside. And then I think we've done a fairly good job in that as you can see from our growth numbers. Actually Steve commented earlier that we actually had a record for Micron in terms of number of makeshifts to the server market this quarter. And we're going to continue to focus on that category and we don't pay the demand is going to change or pause just because of Romley.
Operator: Our final question the will come from Betsy Van Hees of Wedbush Securities.
Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: I was wondering if we can talk a little bit about the NOR Flash business. It seems like there's been a couple of tough quarters and I was wondering if there's any changes you might be making structurally in the organization? And then I think I have a question on SSDs as well.
Steven R. Appleton: Well, the NOR Flash business primarily difficulties have been around the wireless space. As I mentioned earlier, a couple of our customers are having a tough go on it. And so I guess I would only add that when we always knew that the NOR space in the wireless would transition over time to other types of memory, NAND, DIMM, et cetera. And I would say that probably the lack of demand in the marketplace and the challenges some companies are facing maybe we have that occurring fast and then you might have otherwise expected, although it's hard to tell what comes out of it. But basically, it's on course to declare it over time, but we already knew that. The NOR embedded space other than the market being a really bit weaker is actually been pretty stable and pretty steady and the margins are pretty good. So we don't plan on making a lot of changes there, other than I do think that we're actually gaining some market share back in the NOR embedded. And we believe that, that will continue as we get our 45-nanometer 8-inch into the marketplace and then 45-nanometer 12-inch that we're working on that. So we think we're in a pretty good spot there, and it hasn't really changed our perspective on that at all. And what was your next question?
Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: That was helpful. And then on the SSD space, I was wondering if you could help us on the client and commercial. So when you're shipping into the client, are you shipping them SSDs in terms of the separate or just buying it and saying, I want to buy 128-gigabyte or 256? Are they actually being shipped within the system itself? Or if you could kind of help sparse that out for us?
Steven R. Appleton: I think I understand the question to be the type of form factors we ship SSDs to the market. Is that what you're asking, Betsy?
Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: I was asking is if, shipping them into the consumer too crucial depending on, say, I want to buy -- that's already bought a PC and then they said, I want to go ahead and I want to get an SSD to complement that. Or whether the SSD is actually being complementing the hard drive. So the OEM is not shipping the hard drive at all, but shipping the SSD in place of the hard drive.
Steven R. Appleton: It's really is a little bit of both to that equation. I think we see the consumer maybe in an upgrade type of application. And then given all that's going on, I think then there's a borrower and integrator customer are also goes through a crucial, and they're actually fabricating their own light box systems. And the other side of that is the OEM model we serve as well, which is basically we sell the SSD and they get made into finished good products that gets sold to consumer.
Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then one last question. Where do you think the price point is? You talked about the consumer and willing to buy SSD and trying to go back to hard disk drive, what do you think the price point is that the consumer is going [indiscernible] reduction buy an SSD over or preferring SSD over hard disk drives?
Steven R. Appleton: You mean the price point of the PC?
Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Oh, no, just I think the SSD itself, the 128-gigabyte. Does it need to be $100? Or what price point does it need for the consumer?
Steven R. Appleton: That gets into a whole different set of questions that is challenging for me to answer. I would be easier for me to answer the PC targets that I think consumers would react to. And I think basically the common economics is somewhere marginally even to or slightly above where the current PC hard drives are. And I don't mean by capacity, I mean more by just average dollar out of wallet for a price of the PC. And so, I think $499 was kind of a going price for the high-volume PCs in retail. And I think somewhere between $499 and $599 for an SSD-enabled PC will trigger mass adoption in the market.

Operator: Good afternoon my name is Yuwi, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to Micron Technology's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year End 2011 Financial Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And now it's my pleasure to turn the conference over to your host, Kipp Bedard. Sir, you may begin your conference.

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Steve Appleton. Steve?
Steven R. Appleton: Thank you, Kipp. I want to make a few comments, and then Ron Foster will make a few comments. And as Kipp said, we'll open it up for questions. It may seem a lot, but I thought I'd just do a quick refresh where we started the last quarter, which was we're all concerned about Japan. At the time we forecasted that we didn't think there would be any disruptions of significance in our supply chain, and in fact that turns out to be the case. And then it all went pretty smoothly, just as a point worth noting.  On the operations and technology front, we feel like we had a pretty good quarter. As you can see from some of the data we posted from our bit growth and our cost reductions. On the execution side, we had a good operational quarter.  In conjunction with that, our 20-nanometer NAND is ramping, continues to go well. But obviously, we're continuously adjusting the mix to take advantage of higher margin opportunities.  IMFS is on track and also continues to perform pretty well. We're on track to reach wafer start capacity sometime in the late fall. And we continue to make investments in R&D as evidenced by our new research facility that will be ready -- it will be ready for tool installs in the beginning of calendar 2012. So I might add that the facility itself will be 40 -- 50-millimeter capable, but obviously we're very focused on 10 millimeter at this time. One other comment on IMFS, I think it's worth noting is that in our Q4, it accounted for about 25% of our trade NAND revenues, so that's obviously going to be pretty significant for us.  On the CapEx front, we came in at about where we thought we would. We were just over $900 million for the quarter and just under $2.9 billion for fiscal 2011. If you recall, we noted that as we're finishing up the payments of all the tools and sold at IMFS, we have a couple of big quarters. In terms of our thoughts around fiscal 2012, we may -- the same with an expectation of just over $2 billion. I'll switch over and talk about the markets, in our last earnings call, I noted that the DRAM market was pretty weak. It's remained weak at least for most of the quarter that we just ended. There's been some modest improvement in pricing the last few weeks, but I think everybody knows it appears we're still primarily being driven by lack of demand versus a rising oversupply scenario. And this is mostly reflected in the consumer markets, whereas we think the corporate market is in better shape. I cannot say that specialty DRAM remains a bright spot, particularly our growth in server market share and our continued high levels of market share in networking. On the flash front, we obviously have a little better environment. I think on the NAND front, we've experienced some modest price increases, as many of you know. But overall, we're still pretty bullish going into the holiday season as demand remains relatively strong for smartphones, SSDs, tablets. It's worth noting that we are recently recognized or crucial was recently recognized. That's our online retailer channel. It's the market leader now in channel SSD drives in their August repost, so we feel pretty good about that.  And finally the last data point worth noting on NAND is that the total NAND revenues across all of the business units exceeded our total DRAM revenues for the first time in the company's history. And I think that's being impacted, of course, by the decline in the DRAM ASPs, but it's still a significant milestone in our efforts to diversify.  NOR has been a pretty stable story. It seems like we say the same every quarter. We're going to say it again, on the NOR front, earning was again pretty good, pretty stable. We don't expect any extreme pricing pressure in this segment in the foreseeable future. We also released the highest incident in NOR ASP product this quarter, so we feel like we're in a pretty good position.  And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Ron.
Ronald C. Foster: Thanks, Steve. The company's 2011 fiscal year ended on September 1. As usual, we provided a schedule containing certain key results for the quarter, as well as certain guidance for the next quarter. That material is presented on a few slides that follow as well as on our website.  The fourth quarter was financially challenging for us in our industry, which is reflected by the company's net loss for the quarter. Although we were able to meet or exceed all of our output and cost reduction goals in this quarter, DRAM price decline put the overall business in a loss position. However, as Steve mentioned, in the fourth quarter, revenue from sales of NAND products surpassed sales of DRAM, which had a favorable effect on the company's financial results as margins on sales on NAND flash products have remained more stable when compared to the margins on DRAM products. Comparing fiscal 2011 to 2010, we saw a nearly 40% decrease in per bit selling prices for DRAM products compared to about 15% decrease for NAND Flash products. In addition to the DRAM to NAND shift, we continue to have an increasingly diversified product portfolio within DRAM and NAND. Consequently, Micron has achieved significantly higher average selling prices for the year and most recent quarters compared to industry averages. On the operational front, you may recall that in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, IM Flash Singapore qualified its first product for sales to customers, which triggered the start of depreciation of production equipment at that site. We continue to invest in the IM Flash Singapore venture as it continues its production ramp.  As of the capital call that was funded earlier this week, Micron's ownership interest in IMFS is 82%. Due to the timing of changes in wafer allocation relative to changes in ownership, Micron received 57% of the IM Flash Singapore output in the fourth quarter. The output from the IM Flash U.S. operations remains at the initial 51%-49% ownership split.  Bit sales volume increased in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter by 22% for DRAM and 47% for trade NAND. These sales volumes were made possible through increases in production for both DRAM and NAND. Inotera production improved in the fourth quarter, with better wafer output and yields. And as Steve mentioned, we had a significant boost from IMFS revenue in the quarter.  These production improvements led to better than projected cost reductions in the fourth quarter. In fact, IMFS production cost per bit is already below the average for all our other fabs-producing NAND, contributing to a 28% cost reduction for trade NAND in the fourth quarter, with projected double-digit declines in the first quarter as well. The company's overall gross margin percent declined in the fourth quarter, primarily due to lower gross margin on the sale of DRAM products as sales price declines outpaced cost improvements. In particular, selling prices for DDR3 products decreased significantly, over 30% during the fourth quarter.  DRAM bit output is expected to continue a double-digit growth in the first quarter as Inotera volume continues to grow and technology node migrations occurred in all our fabs. Cost reductions will keep pace in high single to low double-digit range. Turning now to the business unit results. In addition to the drop in DRAM selling prices, DSG operating income decreased quarter-to-quarter due to an accrued loss in the fourth quarter in the purchase commitment for Inotera production. NSG trade sales tracked closely to the NAND trends presented earlier, with revenue increases, driven by higher bit sales volumes that outpaced price reductions.  NSG sales continue to show healthy growth with a positive mix shift in the SSDs, which grew over 30% in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. NSG sales to Intel from our IM Flash joint ventures were approximately $255 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 17% increase compared to the third quarter, primarily as a result of the increase in production from IMFS. Recall, these sales are at long-term negotiated prices approximating cost.  WSG sales of products by architecture in the fourth quarter were NOR, NAND and DRAM in decreasing order of revenue. While NOR and DRAM sales were flat from the third quarter, NAND sales were lower on softening wireless OEM and distribution demand. This softening demand also resulted in the write-off of certain customer-specific inventories in the fourth quarter.  Fourth quarter ESG revenue increased slightly compared to the previous quarter, with growth in NOR revenues, partially offset by a slight decrease in DRAM revenue. SG&A expense of $155 million in the fourth quarter increased slightly compared to the previous quarter, partially as a result of higher legal costs associated with pending matters. SG&A expense in the first quarter is expected to be between $155 million and $165 million.  R&D expense for the fourth quarter of $209 million was fairly stable compared to the prior quarter. R&D expense in the first quarter is expected to be between $200 million and $230 million reflecting higher labor costs in advance of ramping our expanding R&D facility in Boise that Steve mentioned.  The company generated $354 million in cash flow from operating activities in the fourth quarter and $2.5 billion for the fiscal year. The fiscal year ended with a cash balance of $2.2 billion. Expenditures for property plant and equipment were $928 million for the fourth quarter and $2.9 billion for the fiscal year, a substantial portion of which related to the equipment acquisition at IMFS. We still anticipate capital spending in total for the 2012 fiscal year to be approximately $2 billion, weighted toward the early part of the fiscal year as payments are made on equipment acquisitions for the IMFS buildout. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be between $570 million and $580 million in the first quarter, and approximately $2.3 billion for the 2012 fiscal year.  As previously announced in the fourth quarter, the company issued $690 million of convertible notes. $57 million of the proceeds were used to purchase capped calls and an additional $150 million was used to repurchase 19.7 million shares previously outstanding. The fiscal year ended with a debt to capital ratio of 17%.  And with that, I'll turn it back to Kipp.
Kipp A. Bedard: Thanks, Ron. We'd now like to take questions from callers. [Operator Instructions] And with that, please open up the phone line.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first questioner in our queue is Alex Gauna with JMP Securities.
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: I was wondering if you could go into the gross margin. A pretty steep fall off here, maybe some of the puts and takes. You had some pretty good bit growth, but I'm wondering about what's happening on the gross margin line and maybe what you're expectations are going forward here.
Kipp A. Bedard: You bet. It primarily was captured in both Steve and Ron's comments. The biggest quarter-to-quarter change was in commodity DRAM and that was not only from an ASP change, which was pretty dramatic Q-to-Q, but also from an enriched mix from Inotera, where they start with more of the standard 2 gigabit DDR3 products, which as Ron mentioned in his notes have the biggest quarter-to-quarter downward pricing pressure. So primarily look forward in that DRAM area.
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: Well then going forward here, can we expect with some of the enriching mix of NAND that we have some leverage going the other direction?
Kipp A. Bedard: Well we're not going to make a prediction. As you know, to gross margins but I think about the call, you'll get our feel for what our cost reduction outlook is and of course we have you overlay that with what you think the market dynamics from an ASP standpoint will bring. But yes, we do have some opportunities in terms of product mix that I think Mark Durcan would like to chat to you in that.
D. Mark Durcan: Yes. Let me just jump in on the NAND mix specifically. While, we did comment last quarter about a richer mix of SLC and we continue to shift larger volumes of SLC in the marketplace. With the ramp that's going on at IMFS continuing to be weighted heavily towards MLC see currently, then I wouldn't look for some big uplift in terms of the richness in mix in NAND over the next quarter or 2. And so we'll see continued cost reduction and bit growth, but that will be primarily in the MLC area and then as we look for additional opportunities to enriching that mix as we move forward.
Operator: And our next questioner in queue is John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: A couple of questions. First, can you talk a little bit about the inventory levels in commodity DRAM? I think at the Analyst Day, you talked a little bit about inventory levels having come down and price bits per box starting to see an acceleration. I'm kind of curious how we ended the quarter.
Mark W. Adams: Yes. This is Mark Adams. The inventory in that channel seemed to play out favorably towards the end of our Q4. The speculation was that through most of our Q4, inventories were up as we commented on in our last earnings call. But we saw some activity, as Steve noted in his opening comments, toward the last week of fourth quarter. And so fourth quarter-to-date that suggests that inventories are in a better condition, a better balance, and it's reflected in a very modest but still upward trend on commodity DRAM pricing.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And then, guys, as a follow-up, can you talk a little bit about the revenue falloff in the Wireless Solutions Group and the operating loss there? And kind of how do we think about that segment of the business moving back into an operating profit position?
Mark W. Adams: Yes. I think, again this is Mark, the Wireless business, as many of you know, over the course of the year has been interesting to say the least in terms of the competitive landscape on the unit side, those selling the phones and those manufacturing and making the phones. And we've experienced our own transitions around products serving those businesses and trying to optimize the capacity that we're allocating to each of the bit use. We're being pretty careful with the growth around Wireless. It's a good business for us long term. But as we service our Embedded business with light products in our DRAM and NAND business, we're trying to be careful with the volatility around the Wireless business against the demand profile. So the top line growth is kind of somewhat limited by our ability to serve other business units and other segments more profitably for Micron. The gross margin and operating results that you're referring to are somewhat weighted down by us transitioning third-party supply of products from the old Numonyx channel to Micron-enabled silicon and that transition is almost done, which will help us. But in the past, this has somewhat limited our top line gross margin there. So we're a little bit more optimistic going forward, and we're a little bit more careful about how we grow in that space. And again, to reflect on that business, the #1 player 1.5 years ago had a close to 40% market share is now down to 20% market share, somewhere in that range. And the nature of the type of products being sold into that business is changing. So we're watching that to make sure we make the right decisions around production capacity, products and then actual customers themselves.
Operator: Our next questioner in queue is Shawn Webster with Macquarie.
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research: A couple of questions. Going back to gross margins for a moment, what was the size of the inventory write-down that occurred? And what were the devices that got written down?
Ronald C. Foster: Shawn, this is Ron. We don't normally itemize inventory adjustments. But what I can tell you is sort of in line with the Mark Adams' comments, given some adjustments going on in the Wireless segment with some of our customized products to go into some of those businesses, we had some inventory adjustments notably in the Wireless and to a lesser extent, in the Embedded market. I would characterize this as being probably $20 million to $30 million above our normal quarterly rates that you'd see, that kind of range.
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then in terms of the bit production, not shipments, but what was your actual bit production sequentially for both DRAM and NAND in your fiscal Q4?
Ronald C. Foster: We had DRAM in fiscal Q4 up mid-single digits. We had NAND up low 40%.
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research: Okay, and maybe one more, if I could squeeze it in.  What are your customers telling you in terms of the demand outlook going into calendar Q4 by your various end markets on the PC side and handsets and servers? Are there any areas that are more stable or have notable strength than others?
Mark W. Adams: Yes. Again this is Mark Adams. The application or segment breakout you're looking for, I would start by separating out Consumer and Corporate. The Consumer business still seems relatively off on the demand side against -- so the PC business is not super strong going into the holiday. And I think that impacts not just PCs. You can also make an argument that the Wireless business will -- could potentially see some negative in that demand pressure. Tablets are kind of a separate piece themself in terms of the demand and it still seems to have some pretty good growth through the holiday. Around things like server and networking, we still see pretty good strong demand. And as best as we can see going forward, it looks to remain strong. As well as in our embedded markets, the Automotive and Amusement segments are pretty strong around those types of NOR and DRAM-based solutions that we sell into those sectors. So again, I would go back to repeat that consumer still seems a little weaker and that the corporate landscape has maintained relatively stable around the application base that we serve.
Operator: Next questioner in queue is Krishna Shankar with ThinkEquity.
Krishna Shankar - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division: Yes. Can you give us the revenue percentages of PC DRAM, specialty DRAM, NAND and NOR? And can you rank gross margins for those 4 segments, please, relative to the corporate average?
Kipp A. Bedard: I can break it down revenue-wise, by the business units for you. We had about 32% in DSG; around 30% in NSG; around 20% in WSG; about 11% in ESG; and around 6%, other.
Krishna Shankar - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division: Okay. And going forward, can you talk -- I know that PC DRAM pricing has continued to sort of -- it kind of picked up a little bit in September but can you talk about sort of the incremental impact of PC DRAM on the November quarter versus the August quarter?
Kipp A. Bedard: Well I think what we'll say to you, Krishna, is our normal talking points, which quarter-to-date on DRAM were down about 10% to 15%. NAND is about flat quarter-to-date. And of course we'll -- it's up to you to look out over the next couple of months and determine what direction ASP will be.
Operator: Our next questioner in queue is Uche Orji with UBS.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Real quick, so if I look at the NAND ASP movements, obviously a lot of that was a mix from SLC to MLC. Can you talk about the breakdown of how that moved around between last quarter and this quarter in the mix of SLC to MLC? And related to that, what are your plans around ramping 3-bit-per-cell? Are you about to -- are there any design wins, which you are looking for to enable that categories to ramp?
D. Mark Durcan: This is Mark. Let me cover the NAND mix fees, anyway. The SLC as a percentage of mix dropped a couple of percent on a wafer basis. But the MLC grew roughly 6% as a percent of the wafer mix, with the remaining difference being a reduction in 3 level cell. So I don't think we want to pin the exact percentages for you. But on a wafer basis, it will give you a sense of how that moved around. And again the absolute value of the SLC was not decreasing. It was -- really, that was driven primarily by growth in total wafers out and total bit of. I'm sorry the second part of the question was what?
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: The second part of the question was how should we think about your growth in 3-bit-per-cell going forward? And will you be able to use that in the embedded market based on the percentage gives us right now?
D. Mark Durcan: Yes. I would look over the next few quarters for the 3-bit-per-cell to be relatively flat as a percent of our mix, although we are working on a number of solutions that over time could drive that number up in some of the embedded applications.
Steven R. Appleton: Yes. I think one more comment to tack on that when you refer to SanDisk, even if it's in the embedded market, I think that their overall capacity is still -- they've been saying they're more OEM-focused in their revenue in that way. They still have a fairly healthy retail business that can consume 3 bit and not pay accountably for performance. And so with the production cut that we're seeing in 3-bit, we're utilizing through our Lexar channel today. But as far as industrial strength applications, 3-bit is not showing up. And I think for us, a large part of our capacity is not necessarily just solely dedicated to retail, there's another unique value-added application markets.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Can I just ask one more question real quick? So which came from production cuts? And Powerchip has been talked about in the press, and perhaps also Nanya has been talked about as possibly cutting back. With the way demand is and given the level of inventory that you have, what will it take for you to cut back on production as a way to sort of help credit inventory? Are there any triggers that you monitor at this point? And then two, the module makers, what is their strategy right now? Are they buying? Or are they just sticking on their hand?
Steven R. Appleton: On the production cuts, we've seen the same data that you have or the same announcements. In terms of Micron, we are, I think, still pretty good in terms of your variable costs versus ASP. And as a result, we don't really have any plan for any production cuts. And I'll let Mark answer the next one.
Mark W. Adams: With regards to the module manufacturers or assemblers, they were partially responsible for the uptick towards the end of August. And I think a part of it was they carry a fair amount of inventory into the summer, and that sold through slower than they had hoped. And they managed their inventory fairly well towards the end of the summer, which reflected in relatively tight supply that drove some of the modest uptick in pricing that we referred to. And we're now kind of in a wait-and-see mode to see how they fair going into the holiday season and the aftermarket. Of course we have our own Crucial business, which is in that, competing in that space and is doing fairly well. But we probably need more data point before we're able to tell you long term how that works out.
Operator: Our next questioner in queue is James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: On the DRAM pricing side, you're talking about quarter-to-date pricing down about 10% to 15%, which seems to be a little bit worse than what we've seen in terms of the PC DRAM on the spot market. Can you talk about some of the mix that might be going on, on the server, especially area that might be contributing to those difference as it trends?
Kipp A. Bedard: Let me just add one thing. That is relative to an average for last quarter, so keep that in mind. And then I think Mark Adams would like to add some commentary around your question about the server.
Mark W. Adams: Yes. I think -- also, when you look at pricing trends over a longer period, say a year or 4 quarters, what typically obviously leads you in either direction down or up is the commodity pricing. And then there is some correlation between the commodity price and the direction of our other application ASPs. That being said, as Kipp noted, we saw some of those modestly decline, which gave us an average when compared to prior quarter isn't -- as kind of in trend line of the commodity pricing. I think commodity pricing wouldn't be down to your points nearly as much as, we're suggesting the overall ASPs, so 10% to 15% is our blend base on the average of last quarter, and some of our higher specialty markets, higher priced specialty applications coming down a little bit. And we think that, that's reflective in the calculation.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, that makes sense. And then as a follow-up, on the NAND side, as you look at the environment right now, could you maybe comment and give kind of a first bogey on what you expect in 2012, your NAND bit production to do through calendar 2012, either a year from today or for the full calendar year?
Kipp A. Bedard: We really like to stay away from a year-over-year comparison. I think as Mark Durcan has noted, we can make a lot of changes to the mix. So we'd like to stay with something more in the short term. We're looking at mid-single digits for our next fiscal quarter, and then something more in the double digits for the quarter after that. And please keep in mind, as we can move these bits around quite a bit.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then your take on the industry growth for next year in NAND?
Kipp A. Bedard: Yes. NAND is looking at around 65% to 75% depending on some of these things we're talking about, SLC, MLC, TLC mix as we go through 2012.
Operator: Our next questioner in queue is David Wong with Wells Fargo.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Have you taken any reserves that might be applied against the fine related to a negative [indiscernible] in the Rambus antitrust case? And how much of SG&A is currently going towards legal costs associated with litigation?
Steven R. Appleton: Well the reserves that we take are on the basis of anticipated litigation costs. We are not taking in the reserves with respect to any kind of judgment or verdict. And of course until we have that, we have no idea nor when that might be.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, and can you give us any magnitude of what your legal costs are running on a per quarter basis?
Steven R. Appleton: Well Ron can jump in here in a second, but obviously they vary as to -- depend on when you're in trial. We just got through a trial, and some of our costs for this last quarter up to, really, about a week ago, are going to be, I think, a little bit higher than normal because we're actually in litigation.
Ronald C. Foster: Yes. We don't actually break down those pieces in our SG&A structure. Bear in mind that we try to estimate each quarter, give it a little bit more color on how this works. The cost to adjudicate or settle items, as Steve mentioned, in a particular quarter and we look forward to the estimated cost of adjudication through all the events we have. And we have a number of events that are detailed in our filings, our Q and K filings that you can look at. We estimate all those and then try to improve the cost estimates in each quarter. We true up those estimates. So obviously we're very involved in a significant suit. We will true up those things in a more timely basis. And we did have some increase in this quarter on a number of categories as we are looking at the go-forward adjudication cost to work through these numerous events, not just the one Ramus item.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Great. And my final question, for the commodity DRAM and for your NAND, are your current contract prices above or below spot prices?
Kipp A. Bedard: I'm sorry, could you repeat the question?
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: For commodity DRAM and for NAND, are the contract prices that you're getting from your big customers, are they above or below what we see on the day-to-day spot prices?
Steven R. Appleton: Well today, they're slightly below, and that's just normal for the cycle that go on in pricing in the market. The spot market normally leads you in one direction or the other. In this case, spot has come up a little bit. As we've noted a few times in the call, the OEM contract pricing is lagging slightly.
Operator: Our next questioner in queue is Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Unknown Analyst - : This is Dean Bramos [ph] calling in for Kevin Cassidy. My question is can you elaborate on plans to accelerate mobile DRAM and other non-commodity DRAM products?
Steven R. Appleton: Sure. As you can -- might imagine, I think like a historical effect, we've sold a lot, a fair amount of DRAM capacity into the computing sector, and most notably, the desktop client, notebook market. Over the years, we spent a lot of time focusing on new application segments. And I think now more than ever, especially with the new business unit structure that we've set out as a company and the acquisition of Numonyx and the market segments they were serving in joining with Micron, we've got a number of new application markets that are serving that same capacity. And when you split that out, markets like amusement and the server and networking segment and PC graphics, if you look at automotive, there's just a number of different sectors that we serve that may be, a while back you would have said were primarily dedicated to the PC space. So the evolution of the applications we're serving are much more dynamic and are leading us to try to optimize our capacity for the most profitable long term and most profitable customer relationships and long-term business. And I think that effectively shows up when you look at our shares in some of these segments, automotive, networking server.
Operator: Our next questioner in queue is C.J. Muse with Barclays Capital.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I guess first question on the NAND side. I was hoping you could help me understand your thoughts on profitability there. Your cost on efforts came in better than what I was thinking. Intel mix is heading lower and that'a also a little bit by the SLC/MLC mix shift. But curious, as that trend goes forward over the next few quarters, how should we think about the uplift to earnings for just NAND by itself and then the contribution to your overall company?
Kipp A. Bedard: Well again we don't like to give you guidance on margin per se. Let me maybe go back, as the previous question might at least help you put this in at least order of margin ranking for the quarter we're just reporting, specialty DRAM still the highest; NAND, second; NOR; and then PC DRAM. So as Mark noted, we do have some pretty nice operational cost stems [ph] coming. We do have some levers in different parts of our business to continue to look at a pretty favorable NAND business. But we're certainly not going to give you any guidance as to operating margin or gross margin.
Ronald C. Foster: This is Ron. One thing I could add to that, if you look at our NSG results, which is our commodity NAND business, we're still running a profit. And that's despite the mix shift that was already commented on in terms of the ramp of IMFS and the higher MLC content. So our core commodity NSG product line, as well as all the other NAND business that go through NSG is still showing a positive operating profit. And then of course we have NAND that goes through our other 2 businesses, Wireless and Embedded, which can have reasonable margins as well. So in addition to the IMFS performance, which we have improving and had already been recounted and how that's going to help us going forward, and the cost structure of IMFS is already below the average of our other fabs. We're showing profitable performance across all of our NAND businesses right now, if you look at the aggregate total. And the improving performance in IMFS will only help that. Of course, the self-predicated on pricing assumptions, which right now look flat.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Sure, that's helpful. And as a follow-up question, you talked about the industry bit growth for NAND tracking 65%, 75% for 2012. Curious, can you grow in line with the industry with the capacity you have at IM Flash Singapore and the $2 billion CapEx budget you've outlined? Or would you need to add capacity there?
D. Mark Durcan: Yes. This is Mark Durcan. Kipp commented on bit growth over the next couple of quarters. I would say, if you want to take a longer term view, keeping in mind the quarter-to-quarter, the numbers will be pretty bumpy. We should be averaging in the high teens in terms of our trade bits into the market, the bits that Micron sells for profit. So we should exceed in as we go.
Operator: Our next questioner in queue is Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.
Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Can you comment on some of the supply dynamics in DRAM? There's some supply that we have come off, maybe some is coming back in next year. What's that dynamic as we look over the next 18 months in DRAM specifically?
Steven R. Appleton: If you think about the comments that we had last quarter, I think they're still consistent for this quarter, which is why I made the statement that we didn't think that we're oversupply-driven challenged right now. It's mostly a demand-driven challenge. And if you look at the CapEx, the CapEx and the capacity going to DRAM has already started to decline. And in fact, if you look at the peak of the CapEx into DRAM, which would have been 2010 moving into the first part of 2011, that it did peak and it's starting to come down quarter-by-quarter. So it really got to a level that was probably just over half of what we had peaked before in the 2006-2007 timeframe. So we're just not going to get the kind of bit growth that we saw in that timeframe, which is why we made the statements that I think we're in a demand-driven challenge environment right now. Now with that in mind, if you look at the CapEx that is being spent and you look at all that data, almost 100% of that CapEx is going in to advancing facilities. Now there's some new silicon, but if you think of what we've been doing with Inotera, with our own facilities, if you think about what LP has been doing or Hynix has been doing, it's also been going into upgrading, if you will, to the next generation of technology, which does drive some bit growth. But it's not near the bit growth you'd get from bringing on new facilities. I think Samsung had some media commentary, where it has some new silicon. But for the most part, I don't think anybody expects any large amount of new silicon coming online. And we're not seeing it in the marketplace. And in fact, if you look at the equipment suppliers, they're confirming that their book to bills are below 1, and there's a lack of demand for equipment going on in that segment. So I think that by and large, it will probably not take much of an improving demand environment that would -- that pretty quickly soak up any excess supply in the marketplace.
Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And as a quick follow up, what's the bit growth supply number you guys are working off as you look into 2012 calendar?
Kipp A. Bedard: For DRAM?
Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: For DRAM, yes.
Kipp A. Bedard: Looking like 40% to 50%.
Operator: Our next questioner in queue is Ryan Goodman with CLSA.
Ryan Goodman - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division: So just on the 65% to 75% growth number you put out, that's a little bit lower than you've talked about in the past. Just curious, how has this impacted the capacity expansion plans for IMFS next year?
Kipp A. Bedard: Really no change. We've always talked about IMFS as being in that 60k start range by the end of the year. And I think Mark, if he hasn't updated, he's more than happy to. It's going really well. It's ahead of schedule, so we'll hit that pretty shortly. None of the budget in that $2 billion CapEx that we've bogeyed for fiscal 2012 includes a ramp beyond that. So the numbers that we used in what I quoted were industry supply numbers, not Micron-specific.
Ryan Goodman - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division: And so right now the expansion plan is pretty much holding at that 60k, there's nothing additional on the $2 billion to take that higher than that as of today?
Kipp A. Bedard: That's correct. Mark would you like...
D. Mark Durcan: No, that's what I was going to say.
Ryan Goodman - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division: Okay. And then just one follow-on also. You'd mentioned a little bit of the Numonyx production was being pulled in-house as a cost driver -- or a cost saver, I should say. I'm just curious, where are we in that? Specifically on the NAND side of things, is that mostly pulled in at this point? Or is that one quarter, 2 quarters away from being fully captive at this point?
D. Mark Durcan: Yes, it's primarily in-house at this point other than a couple of very small volume items, where throughputs and large amounts are in.
Ryan Goodman - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division: Okay. I guess, and if I could just slip in one more really quick, just on the cash. The cash balance is looking pretty good, could you give an update just on the mindset on buybacks versus M&A? I know you did a little bit this last quarter on the buyback side, but going forward, how should we be thinking about that?
Steven R. Appleton: Yes. Well clearly the weaker the market is, the more conservative we get probably in terms of these or our cash. But the other core letter with that is the lower our share price, the lower we view it as being significantly below book where it sits today and maybe it might creates an opportunity for us to consider when we should do something like that. Obviously that's a board decision that will have to be made as we move forward. We've done some of it already as you've noted. But I would say that our balance sheet is pretty strong. And as of right now, we have, I think we have pretty good flexibility, whether it's M&A or any kind of equity restructuring alternative we want to pursue.
Operator: Our next questioner in queue is Bob Gujavarty with Deutsche Bank.
Bobby Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about -- you mentioned the retail SSD business. What's your sense of what OEMs are thinking about SSD adoption for maybe this holiday season and maybe more importantly next year? Is it still build materials challenge for them? Or have you seen some warming up from them?
Mark W. Adams: This is Mark Adams. I've definitely seen some warming up from our major OEMs. I think on the build material sensitivity is obviously around the client, desktop, notebooks portion of that business. And I certainly think as people are looking to kind of differentiate  [Audio Gap] focus and energy and the developments around the silicon continue to mature, i.e. controller development, software and firmware development and make the enterprise more realistic in terms of enterprise cloud performance. And finally, the noted channel fees, it's interesting to note, if you look right now in the sales of SSD units, in the notebook PCs are roughly 45% of all SSDs being sold. And second to that, one might think it would be enterprise but it's not actually. Roughly around high 20s to 30% of the SSDs are sold through a channel today. So when you combine all that, there's a pretty robust appetite for SSDs in the market, good growth in 2012 and thus, we continue to be a pretty strong good growth. And we think the OEMs will become more involved in the market opportunity.
Bobby Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Great. And maybe a quick one on DRAM, is there any opportunity to kind of maybe upsell DRAM beyond just the capacity RDIMM perhaps, specializing on low-power PC DRAM or especially super small form factors or special packaging to get maybe some upsell over just plain capacity commodity DRAM?
Mark W. Adams: Yes. And I think the market loses sight of that because I think the -- to your question, most people kind of say, well tablets are going to eat away at the DRAM markets. But in fact, we have a little bit different view on that. We think that low-power DRAM applications, which of course require us a bigger chipset and we sell it at a premium to the commodity DRAM, we think that, that's a good opportunity for us. And so the differentiation there allows us to penetrate tablets. And over time, we think tablets will continue to grow in content per box, obviously not the same as notebook today. But when you factor in the low-power premium and the bigger chipset around low-power, the impact on wafer utilization, wafer capacity is somewhat negated. And so we think there's a good opportunity for us there, and we're pretty bullish.
Operator: Our next questioner in queue is Betsy Van Hees with Wedbush Securities.
Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Kipp, on the DRAM side, you said 30%, net 30s was DRAM. Of that, how much was specialty and how much of that was commodity PC?
Kipp A. Bedard: Commodity PC is now down to about 15%, 16% of total revenues.
Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then, Steve, you talked about this is a demand-driven downturn in the DRAM market, and then Mark, you talked about the PC -- or you talked about the tablet market. And the fact that this is a double-edged sword for you guys because it was very positive with NAND, but then on the other side, its negative on the DRAM side from a bit growth perspective. So when you put those kind of into perspective on the DRAM side, is it really -- and we're heading into -- we're heading out of peak seasonality. So what's going to be the drivers to get the DRAM market back and DRAM supply and demand back into balance?
Mark W. Adams: So I think -- this is Mark Adams. I think that well in general, we're still going to see some PC growth. I think the last number that I've seen on 2012 PC growth numbers is in the 10% range over 2011. And I think that as I was just commenting on around low-power DRAM, it's not exactly a one for one trade off in terms of capacity utilization. So combined with continued growth around corporate enterprise applications, if you look at, for example, Micron being a leader in the server DRAM business, that's a business where density continue to dramatically increase. I think today we approximate that on average, servers grow out with 25 to 30 gigabytes per box. In networking, we're seeing increased densities as well. So across our overall landscape, we think that there's plenty of application areas to invest on the DRAM development from a go-to-market perspective, and we think that, that will all work itself out in terms of overall supply and demand alignment.
Steven R. Appleton: Sorry, Kipp. One other thing, on the equation, also keep in mind that as tablets have clearly replaced some of the notebooks and the PCs, it's actually also driving quite a bit of server connectivity, quite a bit of connectivity to the Internet and the infrastructure that then drives demand. I mean if you look at the servers being put in place by the Googles and the Facebooks, et cetera, it's actually pretty stunning how much DRAM they're consuming now in order to put the infrastructure in place with which for all these tablets to access. So it's not quite the equation that you are describing. Although you're right, there's a piece of it that's happening there. But there's another side of it that I think people miss.
Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: That was very helpful. And that actually leads to my next question. You were talking about the Google and how they're building their own servers and their need for storage. So that brings me to the enterprise side could you talk a little bit more about your customer engagements? What type of traction are you getting with the tier 1 OEMs? And are you shipping in volume production? And how are you looking for next year?
Steven R. Appleton: I'll let Mark answer most of that questions, but I did want to make the comment that it's an interesting scenario for us where not only are we engaging with what you would think of as the tier 1 server OEMs, but we are also now engaging directly with some of those companies that I mentioned that are becoming big consumers of this product and actually building their own systems. Mark, do you want to add to that?
Mark W. Adams: The only thing I would add to that is those types of customers from a technical competency standpoint are kind of learning as they go, and they look to Micron to be able to add some value there. So if you think around SSDs as an example or overall system performance in DRAM and how the memory architecture amend itself to better performance for their servers, the engagements are a little bit more consultated and technical in nature and we get a value add for that.
Operator: Our next questioner in queue is Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Based on your Analyst Day presentation, it looks like above 45% to 50% of your DRAM wafer outsourced is still at the 5x nanometer node and roughly 40% at 40. Could you just give us you view on where this mix will probably likely be at the end of the calendar year, maybe including 30-nanometer as well?
D. Mark Durcan: Well, first of all, without recharacterizing what you just said, you need to keep in mind that there's a lot of specialty and sort of value add legacy products associated with that mix. On top of that, I'll add that in the current quarter, we did crossover 42 to 50. So the majority of our bits are now 42-nanometer bits. And we will see really probably in the fiscal second quarter, not the quarter we're in now but in the fiscal second quarter of '12 for Micron a significant ramp up on the 30-nanometer node. So majority of the DDR3 42-nanometer, and you'll start to see that shift again when you get another roughly 90, 120 takeup [ph].
Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then, so on your answer in terms of the crossover happening this quarter, that's on a wafer out perspective?
D. Mark Durcan: That's on a bit perspective crossed over in the quarter we just closed.
Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Got it, okay. And as a follow-up question, maybe you can just provide us with an update on the 40-nanometer yields. Are they in-line with your cost reduction targets? And maybe you can just articulate what is the team doing differently at the 4x node from a yield perspective versus 5x where you did struggle a bit. And then maybe provide us with an early glimpse into your 30-nanometer yield improvement rates as well.
D. Mark Durcan: Sure, without getting too specific about yields, I will say, 42-nanometer node ramps had gone better than the 50-nanometer node. A lot of that -- we had commentary on the previous couple of calls about some of the transition issues we experienced in Inotera with mismatched tool set and cycle times around ramping that. Note that as we transition from trends to stack, but beyond that, I think we're pretty happy with where we're at, on a 42-nanometer node now. We still have some upside as we continue to reach what I would call ultimate material yields. But we're clearly executing much better now than we were 6, 9 months ago. On the 30-nanometer node, we're very happy with the just very early silicon coming out of Inotera. That's going really, very well indeed, although, we're in the early days there. So MTV ramping and Inotera still on the early lives out, but very impressed with the execution on the early material.
Operator: Our next questioner in queue is Bill Dezellem with Titan Capital Management.
William Dezellem - Tieton Capital Management: What implications, if any, do you see with Hynix ownership structure changing, impact on the industry?
Steven R. Appleton: Bill, I don't really see a lot as you've probably noted or noticed from the media that they're having trouble finding someone that wants to buy them. And they've limited it to Korean investors only, which means I don't think you're going to see a lot of change in terms of the company's activities. Maybe a little more is being made of, it really exists around the controlling interest. But frankly, I just don't see a whole lot shifting.
Operator: Our final question for today's event is Glen Yeung with Citi.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I think in -- I guess it was in August, you saw a bit per box increase on the commodity [indiscernible]. And so I wonder if you can just talk to us about what you saw there and what are the instance to take away from that.
Mark W. Adams: Yes. This is Mark Adams again. I think my comment at the time was that going to holidays, we continue to see the kind of the entry level value products around 4 gigabytes, both on the desktop side and the notebook side. And it's intriguing that we hear a lot about tablets getting into that and so on and so forth, and that might change strategies, the general overall strategy going in to the holiday. But the fact remains that it continues to get strong around that 4 gigabyte platform memory content, both on the desktop and notebook side. When you look at the building material cost on memory, it's pretty low these days. It's about 3% or so. And that's well below the average that we typically see. And I think the other thing driving that is I think the success that Apple has had kind of in the performance SKU for the holidays, they're not selling a lot of 4-gigabytes and 2-gigabyte units. And so I think the rest of the industry has to watch that and keep up with the kind of performance vendor, if you will. And I think that's driving the content to be in a better place. If you went back 18 months, I look at the data right before our call today, and if you went back 18 months, we were having the same conversation then, it was 3 gigabytes. And we're all saying it will never going to go up. And it stopped dramatically since then. So we don't see on the client side anything more than continued growth beyond where we're at today.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Does Ultrabook give you any reason to be optimistic for this holiday selling season?
Mark W. Adams: Oh absolutely in terms of memory content, absolutely. And we think that 4 again is the basic minimum there. And one of the things -- it's intriguing us because you're not able to upgrade the Ultrabook. They're going to max out on point of sale of the unit itself. And thus, I think that you're going to see increased sale in the Ultrabook market of 4 and 8 gigabyte configurations.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Is too early to expect Ultrabook to be a meaningful contributor?
Mark W. Adams: Yes, it'll be hard for me to call. I think it's definitely too early to tell at this point.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then last question is when you look at 2012 CapEx, can you remind us what the split is between NAND-related and DRAM-related CapEx?
Kipp A. Bedard: You bet. It's about 2/3 NAND wrapping up the MFS's fab and about 1/3 DRAM. And we would like to thank everyone for participating on the call today.

Steven Appleton: Thanks, Kipp, and I also want to thank everybody for joining us today. I thought I'd start with a very brief update on Japan on the supply side, in other words, silicon and other materials like specialty gases and targets. I just want to confirm that there were no interruptions, and I think we're past the difficult period. I think it's worthwhile to comment on how good the Japanese companies were in executing their recovery strategy, and we really don't see any issues with it moving forward. On the customer side, I think similar for the most part, but we do see some fallout from the challenges the country is facing in recovering. In particular, this impacted our ESG revenues, and it was about 5% for the quarter. On the operations and technology, I think we had a number of achievements that were worth noting. Clearly, from the media, you would have seen we sold the Micron Japan wafer fab to TowerJazz, and Ron is going to have some more comments on that in a little bit of a the detail during his segment. IMFS continues to perform very well. Again, Ron will also add some comment on that. But let me just say that we're shipping to customers qualified product from the facility. I will note that, as is typical with us in the past, when we bring on a new facility, it's focused on pretty much a singular process known as singular product and all that coming out of that facility as MLC. Our 20-nanometer NAND still looks good for ramp in the second half of the calendar year, so we're pretty pleased with that. And then let me add that we are sampling 30-nanometer DRAM from our Virginia facility, and that technology will spread to another DRAM facility in the fall. And then finally, on the SSD side, I mentioned under technology because, obviously, that's required to have success in that space. Our revenues continue to rise. We're up about just under 40% quarter-over-quarter. So we feel pretty good about that. Now in terms of a couple of marketing product segment comments, the DRAM, I think in our last earnings call I noted that we thought that the markets were bottoming at that point. I think overall, this might turn out to be true, but we all know from the reports that, at least for us in the mini world, that it stayed at these lower levels. Fortunately, it's also true that in terms of the DRAM supply that it's been relatively muted compared to last cycle, so that's obviously helpful. Although I'll note that we've had some inventory accumulation in the channel. In other words, channeled our customer base in probably about 5 weeks. So not dramatic, but more than -- a little bit more than we'd normally see. And more specifically, desktop and notebooks continue to be weak, and I'll just say that I don't think we really have a good feel for how that's going to play out over the next quarter or 2. I think we can also add wireless to the list of weak markets with respect to the lower value segments. But fortunately, most of the other markets actually look pretty good. They look better. The corporate and enterprise actually looks strong through the second half of the year. In particular, the server networking and AIMM all look pretty positive. On the NAND front, I think the story is a little bit different. Pricing has moved around a little, but for the most part, it's been in line with what we expected. Wireless, particularly smartphones, in terms of memory consumption, continues to look okay. I mentioned on the SSD shipment, I'll note that we're up quarter 2 over quarter one, and we're up again quarter 3 over quarter 2, as I just said, in the 40%. So that's obviously very positive. But I think as opposed to the DRAM inventory levels, for both Micron and our customers, we remain relatively tight in NAND inventory with the big consumption by the SSDs and tablets. On the NOR front, and I think as you might expect, other than the hiccup in Japan, it's all pretty steady and normal. All of this leads me to make a few final comments.  Business units and the associated structure with those business units and the company is working well. The structure allows us to strategically focus on customer markets and applications, and I think it's really starting to help drive the diversification of product line while at the same time, we're able to leverage our advanced technology and manufacturing scale. Ron can add a little color later on about the financials. But when you take a closer look at our financials, keep in mind that essentially what occurred during the quarter was that we shipped less product into the commodity markets. We shipped more product in the higher-margin markets. And that shifted up our cost structure somewhat, but it also more so lifted our margins. So in summary, I think we're in relatively good shape as compared to some others. But we still have to deal with the continued pricing pressure, in the DRAM, in particular, in the commodity markets, and make sure that we're in the best position we can for whatever happens in these variety of markets moving forward. But I think at the end of the day, we feel pretty good about our position.  And with that, I'll hand it over to Ron.
Ronald Foster: Thanks, Steve. The company's third quarter of fiscal 2011 ended on June 2. As usual, we provide a schedule containing certain key results for the quarter as well as guidance for certain metrics for the next quarter. That material is presented on a few slides that follow as well as on our website.  As was previously announced, we sold our Japan fab operations to TowerJazz, as Steve mentioned, in the third quarter. We will continue to source wafers from that operation through a wafer supply agreement which extends over approximately the next 3 years. The sales transaction resulted in a gain in other operating income of $54 million in the third quarter. In addition, there was a tax provision of $74 million stemming from the gain and the write-off of deferred tax assets, netting to a $20 million loss for the total transaction in the quarter. Other operating income also includes a gain of $35 million from the final installment from Samsung under the cross-license agreement we entered into earlier this year. For the whole full fiscal year, we recognized all of the $275 million gain from the cross-license. Recall that there is a withholding tax on these payments that is reflected in the income tax provision of $6 million in the third quarter and $45 million year-to-date. The total tax provision of $104 million in the third quarter includes the effects of the sale to TowerJazz and the Samsung cross-license fee in addition to our regional taxes in other jurisdictions. As you see from the chart, we expect the tax provision in the fourth quarter to be back to more normal levels. IMFS continues to ramp ahead of schedule. As Steve mentioned, we began to charge most of the manufacturing costs in the inventory as we have qualified the site's first products for sale to customers in the third quarter.  The company's overall gross margin percentage improved in the third quarter compared to the previous quarter, primarily due to favorable mix shifts in DRAM and decreases in DRAM production costs. Total bit sales of NAND products were relatively the same level in the third quarter as in the previous quarter. Micron's trade sales shifted toward lower bit density but higher-margin SLC devices and client SSD applications, as Steve mentioned, which explains the increase in NAND average selling prices and costs you see in the chart. Inventories of NAND product increased during the third quarter, primarily as a result of the timing of customer qualifications and the IMFS ramp. The mix of product sales by architecture, DRAM, NAND and NOR, was relatively stable in the third quarter compared to the previous quarter. With the ramp of IMFS in the fourth quarter and where Micron has been providing all of the recent capital contributions, Micron's share of IMFS output in the fourth quarter, which is based on ownership share with a one-year lag, will be 57% and is expected to increase to 83% in about a year based upon current ownership.  Last quarter, we reported operating results for the first time along with newly established business units of DRAM Solutions, NAND Solutions, Embedded and Wireless Solutions. The third quarter results for DSG track closely with the DRAM product ASP, cost per bit and bit volumes presented earlier. Although revenue declined, operating income grew through manufacturing cost reductions and increased mix sold to premium DRAM segments, while total average selling prices remained roughly flat. NSG trade sales, that's the NAND Solutions Group, tracked closely to the NAND trends presented earlier with revenue down but operating income percentage up slightly from the second quarter. NSG sales to Intel from our IM Flash joint venture were approximately $220 million in the third quarter, an 8% increase compared to the second quarter. Recall these sales are at long-term negotiated prices approximating cost.  WSG sales of products by architecture in the third quarter were NOR, NAND and DRAM, in decreasing order of revenue. While NAND and DRAM sales were flat from the second quarter, NOR sales were slightly decreased on lower wireless OEM demand. ESG sales of products by architecture in the third quarter were NOR, DRAM and NAND in decreasing order of revenue, with rank order unchanged from the second quarter. ESG revenue decreased 4% in the third quarter, notably in the amusement market, which was impacted by the Japan earthquake and tsunami.  R&D expense for the third quarter of $211 million increased from the second quarter as expected due to higher pre-qualification costs as we readied key new products for production. R&D expense in the fourth quarter is expected to be at approximately the same level as in the third quarter, between $205 million and $215 million. SG&A expense of $151 million increased compared to the previous quarter, partially as a result of a higher level of costs associated with the Numonyx integration and pending legal matters. SG&A expense in the fourth quarter is expected to be between $140 million and $150 million. The company generated $589 million in cash flow from operating activities in the third quarter, and we remained free cash flow positive for the period. At the end of the third quarter, we had cash and short-term investments of $2.4 billion. Expenditures for property, plant and equipment were $534 million. We anticipate capital spending in total for this fiscal year to be approximately $2.9 billion. This amount can vary, however, based on the timing of year end tool receipts. We estimate capital spending in the next fiscal year to be down with initial estimates around $2 billion plus or minus as the payments for initial IMFS capacity are completed in the first half of the FY '12 fiscal year. Decisions on future IMFS capacity expansion beyond the current target of 60k wafers per month by the end of the calendar year will be made based on overall market demand and customer requirements as we go forward. Primarily due to the additional production assets placed in the service of IMFS, we're expecting depreciation and amortization to be between $580 million and $590 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $2.2 billion for the 2012 fiscal year. During the third quarter, we repaid the remaining balance of $250 million on a credit agreement with our former TECH Semiconductor joint venture. At the same time, we were refunded the associated restricted cash deposit of $60 million. In total, during the third quarter, we repaid $327 million of debt and borrowed $173 million through equipment financing. The current debt-to-capital ratio is 14% after these repayments. In the Numonyx acquisition, we assumed a guarantee related to debt in the Numonyx joint venture that included a restricted cash deposit as collateral for the guarantee. During the third quarter, that joint venture repaid the debt, and we were refunded our $250 million cash deposit. As a consequence, $250 million in restricted cash shifted into our cash balance.  In the Numonyx purchase accounting, we recognized the liability for the fair value of that guarantee. That liability was relieved with the termination of the guarantee, which resulted in a $15 million gain in other nonoperating income in the third quarter. And for now, I'll close and turn it back to Kipp.
Kipp Bedard: Thanks, Ron, and with that, we'd like to take questions from callers. [Operator Instructions] With that, let's please open up the line.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Uche Orji from UBS.
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank: So let me start by asking you about the DRAM expectation bit for the coming quarter. So one of the expectations we made [ph], your gross margins were [indiscernible] revenues fell short of expectations. Part of that is obviously mix. As we look into the mix for the coming quarter, what should drive the outlook to mid-single-digit? Should we expect that mix to also be positive for gross margin?
Kipp Bedard: Yes, around specialty memory, those obviously have a positive, more positive impact to gross margin. Was that the bit of your question?
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank: That's correct, yes.
Kipp Bedard: Yes. Specialty memory continues to be our highest-gross-margin products.
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank: Right. But in terms of how we expect -- the expectation for the coming quarter, are we expecting within that guidance, what is your view of what should happen within the PC markets? And how do you expect the PC market demand for DRAM to pan out?
Mark Adams: This is Mark Adams responding to that. I think in general, we've all seen a softening of the desktop, notebook, PC climate. Partially offset by some growth around tablets, more helpful on the NAND front, obviously, than the DRAM front. But it's been pretty hard to kind of see beyond Q3 calendar year in terms of what the demand picture looks like as some of the bigger OEMs have kind of come out and made their forecast, the analysts certainly have made their forecasts, and overall, the PC environment is weak at this point, and hard for us to call too much further out in the future.
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank: Just one more question. In terms of severance and networking, that's one area where we've seen strength, especially in your comments earlier. How do you expect that to trend within your guidance and for the rest of the year? And we've seen strength from servers for the past few quarters. And how much more runway do you think we can get from that?
Mark Adams: Well, that's a good point, because my -- I should have qualified my comments. The PC comments are primarily around the consumer environment. The corporate refresh is still in process and going fairly well in terms of the NAND side for our more enterprise-corporate type products. And servers certainly is one of the products that Kipp was just referring to as being a better opportunity for us and more stable for us. And we think that continues not just around the servers, but even our networking product portfolio and some of our embedded products, more in the commercial applications. So the softening we're talking about is primarily around the consumer environment, and desktop, notebook. Even Steve made reference to the value lines market consumer -- value line mobile market. But the enterprise applications, especially DRAM, continues to be pretty strong for us, and we see no reason that's going to change in the coming quarter.
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank: And just lastly, IMFS. With the plus 4 4Q [ph] targets, you talked about that ramping. Is it possible for us to know what the stats [ph] will be for the 4Q?
Kipp Bedard: We've given you the bogey of 60k wafers per month, and the more current guidance is all baked into our bit growth guidance for Q-to-Q.
Operator: Our next question comes from James Schneider from Goldman Sachs.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Could you talk about the inventory levels at customers you mentioned with respect to DRAM, and when you expect those to kind of be back on normal levels? And within that, can you talk about what's the linearity of your DRAM sales were this quarter?
Mark Adams: Sure. I think I'd break the inventory answer into 2 parts: the OEM component to that and the channel. The OEM component, I think, will probably be managed fairly well throughout this calendar quarter. So I think that -- I'm sorry, what I really referred to is calendar quarter Q3, our Q4. I think the OEMs have got a good handle on that, because I think that's already in process. The channel fees, as Steve mentioned, are somewhere in the 5-week range, 4 to 5 weeks. And I think that really was a reaction to Japan and some early accumulation on concerns over supply to the -- in the spot market and the aftermarket module market. So I think that is more of something that gets to be managed over time here over the next coming 90 days or so. But I feel that the OEMs are in better control of that and already actively working through that. The channel folks are getting into it now, and I think that's what's causing the differentiation between the spot market pricing and the OEM contract pricing.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Great. Thanks. That's helpful. And then with respect to the mobile and server DRAM spaces, can you tell me whether you see any of your competitors moving capacity to those areas? And what kind of impact do you expect on pricing, either what you saw at the last quarter or what you expect over the next couple?
Mark Adams: Sure. I think server is -- so we need to just run over and do that on a quarter-to-quarter basis, there's a lot of qualification and supply variables that go into actually getting into the server business. I think on the mobile side, a lot of people have talked about that, and we've seen one of our competitors talk about going back to the commodity business. So that's a harder one to gauge. But I also think that comes with the challenges of not just redirecting capacity, but getting qualified at some of these bigger OEMs. So it's not a perishable capacity choice. You have to kind of be in the business and be committed to it over time. I think the comments might be more fluff than reality in the short term.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Understand. And one last one for me. Can you talk about where PC DRAM pricing is relative to your own cash cost today?
Kipp Bedard: I'm not aware of anybody that gives out their cash costs, sorry.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. Fair enough.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh from Sterne Agee.
Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: Yes, I guess just on the DRAM side, obviously, it looks like you had some, at least some issues on your data site [ph]. Is that a result of, you think, that should help you on the year margin in the output side as you go out?
Kipp Bedard: Vijay, you were breaking up a little bit. Could you repeat the first part of your question?
Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: Yes. In the May quarter, you guys probably had [ph] some impact from Inotera. Is that a real issue and [indiscernible] should help you going forward in the margin end of business [ph]?
D. Durcan: This is Mark Durcan. On Inotera, we continue to make progress there not only on the 50-nanometer yields, but also on the 42-nanometer ramp. And we're looking for an improving situation as they move forward quarter-over-quarter.
Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: And when I look at your mix in DRAM now, what's the mix between PC, server and mobile? And where do you see that end of the year?
Kipp Bedard: Today, personal systems are about 18%, and that looks like that will come in about where we will average for the year. As Ron mentioned, we're getting awful close to having NAND surpass total DRAM revenues for the first time in our history as well.
Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: Got it. Okay, and it looks like your CapEx goes down pretty nicely next year. What are the puts and takes to that $2 billion that you gear out for next year? Is there a chance that comes back more the last 2 years kind of in the $600 million range CapEx?
Steven Appleton: Well, I think that our CapEx next year and the variability of it will really be based upon how we view the market. So our CapEx for our fiscal year, keep in mind that we still have IMFS we're paying for as the equipment's been delivered or under qualification, there's somewhat of a lag delay. So a lot of that CapEx is associated with IMFS, of which we're already committed to, and ramping, and the rest of it is just sprinkled throughout the rest of the network. That's not likely to change much unless for some reason, we feel like we ought to try to get more production out of IMFS, in which case we would spend more to do that. But that's all market-dependent at this point.
Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: So all the CapEx is for NAND and IMFS, nothing in -- mostly all for NAND, not for DRAM, right?
Steven Appleton: No, that's not true. I didn't say that. I said a lot of it was for IMFS and NAND, and then the rest of it is sprinkled throughout the rest of the network. Remember, we got many fabs. It doesn't take a whole lot per fab to add up to a total of $2 billion.
Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: Got it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Amir from Lazard.
Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC: How could you -- you view the NAND side here as you ramp up IMFS in terms of the impact on gross margins here. So how should we look at kind of the margin profile of that business here in the next 6 to 9 months?
Kipp Bedard: Danny, in terms of gross margin ranking, trade NAND is one of the better ones we have. It's about our second-highest gross margin. So to the extent that we're shipping more of those bits, that will certainly help on the gross margin side.
Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC: So as you -- and IMFS, I'm assuming, will just have a positive impact as the volume increases there?
Kipp Bedard: There's a couple of moving pieces, so you have to be a little bit careful. Obviously, we're adding more bits. We get more of that output, so that's good. There's obviously an ASP component to it, which we don't want to get into try and predicting today. But steady-state today, it's our second-highest gross margin product.
Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC: Okay. And then the other question is kind of on the wireless side. I mean, you made some commentary that it is a little weak right now. Kind of what do you predict here in terms of kind of the next quarter? I mean, do you see seasonality starting to come back, helping the wireless segment? Or do you have the same visibility in the wireless side as you do in the PC side?
Kipp Bedard: I think our visibility in the wireless side is pretty good. I think part of what's going on in the wireless space is a little bit of a shift in the industry structure, with market share shifting from company A to company B. I think that's contributing a little bit to the fogginess in terms of that business. Having said that, I would think with some newer models coming out, and it is a bit of a seasonal uptick, that it'd be reasonable to assume that there could be an improvement in terms of the market conditions around wireless coming into back-to-school and the holiday. And remember, our comments were around the segment of the wireless market. The smartphone market continues to be very strong, and I also think that might be something that contributes to some higher-end gross for the back half of the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Cassidy from Stifel, Nicolaus.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. Can you give some of the puts and takes on the trade NAND for next quarter being down low double-digits? Is it less demand in the SSDs or is that a steady-state? Or maybe just give a description of what's happening there.
Kipp Bedard: I think -- let me make sure you're reading the right lines there. We look at bit production up double-digits, and currently, the ASP is down low doubles. Is that what you're...
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Right. Yes, I was asking about the -- it was up 15% in the third quarter, and now you expect it to be down low double-digits. So I was wondering...
Kipp Bedard: That's correct, Kevin. As Ron mentioned in his comments, we're going to see -- we're obviously executing pretty well at IMFS, and those will be more discrete units here in the short term. So expect more OEM-type business during the short-term quarter. So it's mix-related.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. It is mix-related. And are you allowed to say what -- or do you know what Intel's mix was going to be?
Kipp Bedard: No.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And maybe on the DRAM side, can you say what your percentage is of 2-gigabit DRAM now?
Kipp Bedard: Kevin, I don't have that breakout in front of me. But I'm happy to follow up with you. It's something that we present from time to time, and so I'll get it to you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Berenbaum from MKM Partners.
Daniel Berenbaum - Caris & Company: Can we come back to DRAM shipments in the quarter? Just kind of running through the math, it looks like your DRAM bit shipments were actually down somewhere in the 10% range. Is that somewhere in the right ballpark? And can you help walk me through why they were down so much?
Mark Adams: Yes, sure. This is Mark Adams again. The DRAM shipment was more of a carryover for us, especially around some of our OEM customers, for Inotera output. They've got us timely in the quarter, but we could not convert it into modules in time to get to our OEM agreement. Secondly, towards the end of our quarter, we saw a pretty wide gap between the spot markets and the OEM contract market and certainly didn't want to play into the game of end-of-quarter negotiations when the spot market's driving price down further. So we chose to keep some of that inventory for our larger OEMs going into the Q4 fiscal.
Daniel Berenbaum - Caris & Company: So then some of the increase in the inventory in your balance sheet was due to holding onto some of that NAND -- sorry, holding on to some of that DRAM, sorry?
Mark Adams: Absolutely. I mean, absolutely the case. And again, if you track the spot market pricing over the last 2 to 3 weeks of our quarter, it started to get pretty volatile. And for us, given our OEM demand curve for Micron memory, it was a pretty logical choice not to play in the spot market game at the end of the quarter.
Daniel Berenbaum - Caris & Company: Okay. And then can you comment on the gross margin in the Wireless and Embedded Solutions business? How did those trend? Either -- if you're willing to give absolute numbers, that would be great. If not, how did those trend from last quarter?
Kipp Bedard: We're not going to give you the actual numbers, but they did come down a little bit in those segments.
Daniel Berenbaum - Caris & Company: I'm sorry, gross margin came down in those segments?
Kipp Bedard: Yes.
Daniel Berenbaum - Caris & Company: And are we past sort of all of the purchase accounting from the Numonyx acquisition in terms of gross margin?
Kipp Bedard: No. There was an impact, a little larger than we expected, actually. It's about a $20 million impact in this quarter that we just reported, and that's about equal to what's left. We do anticipate the rest of that will come in over the next couple of years.
Daniel Berenbaum - Caris & Company: You had a $20 million negative impact in the quarter, okay. And if then the rest will come through, you would then expect all of the Numonyx accounting treatment to be done sort of by your fiscal Q1 of next year?
Kipp Bedard: It's all related to the certain parts that did get written up in the inventory, and so some of those are legacy parts that will sell out over the next year, even. But it won't all clear up in one quarter.
Daniel Berenbaum - Caris & Company: Okay. And then while we're sort of on those kind of charges, were there any other inventory adjustments in the quarter?
Kipp Bedard: No.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Wong from Wells Fargo.
David Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: On your summary sheet, you talked about your trade NAND cost per bit being up approximately 12% in the quarter. To what extent do startup charges play into that?
Ronald Foster: This is Ron. We had startup charges, as I mentioned, last quarter, and we had some reduced level of startup charges overall this quarter. In total, for the company, it's about $36 million in the second quarter, dropped to about $20 million in this most recent quarter. Some of those costs are now being put into inventory and will go out with the shipments of IMFS product in the coming quarters.
David Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: So that then wasn't the primary driver of the cost per bit for trade NAND being up.
Ronald Foster: No.
David Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: So was there some other factor?
Ronald Foster: Yes. If you look at it, the ASPs were up about 15%, and our costs were up about 12% in the quarter and the impact was related to mix, as Steve commented, specifically in the area of higher SLC mix. SLC is a higher-margin product. It's also higher cost. And so that affects the top line, but we end up with more margin, as Steve mentioned in his comments, going forward. Also, there was some SSD growth that he mentioned that helps drive up both the pricing and the cost a little bit.
David Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Right. I see. Then on the DRAM side, what was the pattern of your contract pricing through the quarter? Was contract pricing rising or falling as you progressed through the May quarter?
Mark Adams: I would say that early in the first half to 2/3 of the quarter, the contract pricing was rising. And I'd say it kind of plateau-ed and flattened out towards the end of the quarter.
David Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: So if it was rising through the quarter, why does your ASP estimate for the current quarter, the quarter today, why is it down so much? Was there a huge plunge at the beginning of the current quarter? Or is there some other factor that's playing into your expectation for DRAM ASPs looking like it's going to be down high single-digits?
Mark Adams: Well, there's 2 things there. The guidance we're giving is quarter year-to-date. So I'll come back to that in a second. But your question earlier was about Q3 and the trend during Q3. And I stopped short by saying that it was flat during the last month, which was May. Our June contract pricing is down slightly, and then we also have some mix effects there as well, causing the net impact of the quarter-to-date guidance we're giving you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Freedman from Gleacher.
Doug Freedman - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. Can I question you on what you think the bit demand for the full year is now looking like it's going to be, given where we are, halfway through the year now, on both DRAM and NAND?
Kipp Bedard: Let me start, Doug, with the bit supply, and then Mark can talk you through maybe some of the different segments. We look at DRAM somewhere in that 40% to 45% range. We see NAND in that 70% to 80% supply range. Duly noted that on recent equipment conference calls, they have referenced equipment pushouts. So it does -- in our analysis, it does look like we've probably come through our or are in the highest sequential bit growth quarters now. And that going through the rest of the year, especially in DRAM, they tend to tail off pretty good. We're fairly -- looking at the NAND numbers in terms of supply, looks like you're going to run kind of low double-digits here for the next couple of quarters. And with that, I'll let Mark maybe talk you through some of the segment demand things that he sees.
Mark Adams: Yes, it's pretty consistent with earlier comments. I think it's -- the consumer business overall tied to kind of the macroeconomic environment, it just seems a little bit hard to predict and a little bit softer than we might have thought going into July. But certainly, you've got some seasonality effect in there as well. So around DRAMs, for example, the PC business, to earlier comments, is weaker than we had hoped. And right now, we don't have line of sight on anything in terms of a recovery back to an upward-priced environment in DRAM on the consumer side, especially DRAM and our better margin product areas. We continue to remain pretty bullish, because the demand there has remained strong. And I referenced this earlier, but the server products and the server business overall is pretty good. The growth there on units is still in line with, I think, what the analysts kind of suggested we would be for 2011. Networking. Again, networking products remain strong for us as well. And our AIMM business, which is part of the Embedded business unit, is very stable also. So it's not that we can make one conclusive comment about the overall memory landscape. I think the commodity consumer-oriented businesses are seeing some softness of demand side for DRAM, and the specialty businesses around enterprise and corporate are pretty good. When you look at NAND, we're not seeing anything that would change our perspective on a pretty strong demand environment for NAND. SSDs have been a continually good story for us at Micron. Steve referenced earlier slightly below 40% quarter-over-quarter growth, new technology launches, and good reviews for us and customer qualifications on enterprise performance drives. So SSD could be a strong place for us. If you look at the smartphone piece of the business, where a lot of that NAND is consumed in the mobile market, still very strong. And the tablet business is, again, is another good environment for us for NAND. So we think the drivers on NAND are pretty consistently strong through the back half of the year, especially [indiscernible]. And I don't think anything's going to change that going through the holidays, minus some significantly different environment as far as the economy.
Doug Freedman - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: If I could, for my follow-up, focus in on the mobile DRAM side of the business and your aspirations to ship phase change by the end of the year. Can you give us an update on where you stand and what the mobile DRAM market is bringing to you guys in terms of an opportunity?
D. Durcan: Yes, this is Mark Durcan. We continue to make good technical progress on phase change, both from a liability perspective as well as yield improvement. The actual uptake in the market is going to be tough to call right now, but we're definitely moving more resources towards both products to make sure we're in a position to deliver for that market space.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ryan Goodman from CLSA.
Ryan Goodman - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets: Question on servers. We've started to hear some chatter that server ASPs were actually coming under more pressure than normal over the past quarter. I know you sounded actually pretty bullish kind of looking out through the remainder of the year. Just curious if you saw anything like that. I mean, the premiums are still there. But are you feeling any more pressure? And any thoughts on the impact of OMNI [ph] coming on in the second half?
Mark Adams: I don't think that, that pressure has manifested itself back down to us. I do think, though, that when you look at what's driving the application here on the server products itself in terms of the markets, in terms of cloud and some of the other applications, you are seeing a broader value line of servers take share in the market. And that's the unit volume shifting that way and could potentially drive that. We're not seeing that implicate our server pricing too much on the memory side of the house, but I think that there seems to be a higher volume of distributed server technology in the market, and I think to that extent that you could see that being potentially commoditized downstream. But we don't -- we haven't seen any impact internally.
Ryan Goodman - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets: Okay. And then just one follow-up on the NAND side of the equation. In the smartphone market, just curious about your thoughts on content trends at the high end of the market. If you think -- how do you think the demand picture comes together if there isn't a lot of content growth at the high end of the market? And also, just curious about, for Micron specifically, how you guys are doing in terms of gaining some traction in that area of the smartphone market.
Mark Adams: I think, overall, we're pleased with that. If your question was around if the content per smartphone on the high end doesn't materialize, is that the question?
Ryan Goodman - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets: Yes. If there's not a lot of growth in content at the high end, are you still comfortable with the overall demand picture for 2011 and then going into 2012?
Mark Adams: Yes, I think absolutely. Just in terms of unit growth alone, I think there's an opportunity there for us as well as if you look at the evolution of what people are using the smartphones with, we feel pretty confident that the content piece will evolve favorably.
Ryan Goodman - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets: And then any update you can just give on how Micron specifically is doing in terms of getting traction in the high end? It seems like a lot of the embedded progress historically has been more in the consumer areas. Just curious how you guys are doing on smartphone.
Mark Adams: To the extent that when we look at our NAND portfolio, to the extent that we're choosing to be engaged in that market, which is pretty strategic to us, we feel pretty good about it. We feel, needless to say from a cost perspective and technology perspective, it's a good place for us to invest. And our customer demand continues to remain strong.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Dezellem from Tieton Capital Management.
William Dezellem - Tieton Capital Management: Relative to the SSD strength that you're experiencing, would you please provide some more details and color behind what's taking place there, and including who are you finding the primary adopters of SSD to be at this point in the adoption cycle?
Mark Adams: Sure. Our experience has been that the OEMs are really trying to adopt us to establish a separate class of notebook users, if you will, and trying to add some higher-margin opportunities themselves in selling up to executives and consumer power users. The volumes are pretty significant around that. And you think about the sudden growth in terms of enterprise applications actually manifesting themselves up in terms of revenue in the category, those are still pretty much the 2 drivers, I would say, are the OEMs driving power SKUs for the enterprise executives as well as consumer power users. And then in the enterprise sector, I'd say the shipments basically doubled quarter-over-quarter in that sector, and we continue to see long-term growth there for us through the next 2 to 3 years.
William Dezellem - Tieton Capital Management: And then following that, where are we at today with the cost differential versus the traditional hard drives?
Mark Adams: I still think from a cost per gigabyte, we're not quite close to yet equality. I think what you're seeing from the shipment and, both in the client space and the enterprise space, would suggest that even though we're not at cost parity, we're not really even close yet on a dollar-per-gigabyte basis, the benefits of the SSD and total cost of ownership allow us to compete pretty favorably.
William Dezellem - Tieton Capital Management: And one additional question. What is the rate of cost reduction that's taking place with SSDs versus hard drives?
Kipp Bedard: Well, Bill, it's a different discussion point because we can, on the discrete device level, bring costs pretty down. But what you're really asking is the cost to our customers, and that's more market-driven. So you have to be a little more specific.
William Dezellem - Tieton Capital Management: Your point's well taken, and I'll ponder the question more offline.
Operator: Our next question comes from Glen Yeung from Citi.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc: There's been some discussion about Micron's potential partnership with Elpida. What are your thoughts around balancing consolidation and potential needs for additional capacity?
Steven Appleton: Well, first of all, we don't have any partnership with Elpida at this point. And I think if you look at the entire industry picture, obviously, there are a few companies that are still struggling. The Taiwanese are struggling a lot, and then you draw Elpida into the mix. Of course, in terms of total size, they are also one of the smaller companies in the memory business. And I think over time, most of that will get resolved. But in the short term, typically, what we have to see is some kind of crisis in the industry and the more of a crisis, the quicker the resolution of consolidation industry. And whether we're in that time period or not, right now, I think it will depend on how long the market being down lasts. But short of that, we'll just have to see how it plays out.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc: Thank you, Steve. And as you ramp IMFS, is there a preferred mix of captive versus non-captive as Micron's ownership and output ownership of NAND from IMFS grow?
Steven Appleton: Well, is your question do we have a preferred use of the product in our own product downstream, as opposed to selling to the merchant market, or is it something different?
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc: I guess the proportion of captive versus non-captive. As the ownership moves towards 80%, is there a...
Steven Appleton: I see, I see. Well, I think you can correctly surmise that the ability to ship our NAND product and downstream products, in other words S -- i.e., SSDs and other things, just has there buying proposition and more margin for us. So to the extent that we can do that, we'll be focused there. But I would say that our objective, in particular as our percentage of the total, as Ron mentioned, our percentage of the total output of the joint venture comes to Micron, our objective really is, though, to still serve all the markets in some form, and obviously, we'll direct that capacity to the best return for the company.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc: And just one last one for Ron. With the Samsung, the tax issues going away next quarter, what was the guidance for taxes beyond next quarter after the impact of Samsung taken away?
Ronald Foster: Well, yes, it's more normal rates of $15 million to $25 million kind of range going forward on taxes. That's our normal rate that we pay for the other regional jurisdictions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bob Gujavarty from Deutsche Bank.
Bobby Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank AG: I have one question, maybe a little longer term. But as some of the notebook products kind of mimic more of the tablet functionality, I've talked to a few people that said they have to use mobile DRAM instead of commodity DRAM in kind of notebook, PC notebooks. What do you guys think of that as a longer-term opportunity to kind of move ASP up and then potentially move your dollars per PC system up?
Mark Adams: You know, it's funny. We tend to think slightly the opposite of how you stated it, which is that the tablet not only serves in a mobile application environment, but starts to mimic some of the functions of PC. And I think there's a fair point that, that might be an opportunity for us, but it is on kind of a partner-by-partner basis in terms of how they look at their architecture and their system.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shawn Webster from Macquarie.
Shawn Webster - Macquarie Research: I have a question about the impact in Japan. So you mentioned that -- was that 5% of ESG or 5% of your overall revenues you think were impacted? And the inventory in the channel that accumulated. Is that all accumulated right after the earthquake? Or is that something that you think that was more -- there's maybe a buildup before, and it just spiked up after the earthquake, and it's come down a little bit after that?
Steven Appleton: Well, in terms of the Japanese impact to our revenues, I had mentioned that about 5% of our Embedded group was affected, primarily the entertainment industry over there, as you might expect. In terms of the inventory channel buildup, Mark can add a comment here if he would, but essentially, that happened after we had the Japanese event. And I would say to the extent that some of it did go, it's clearly trying to make sure that they were covered. But in addition to that, I would just add that, as Mark already did, that a couple of the markets were weaker than maybe people were anticipating, so they had some inventory that they accumulated.
Shawn Webster - Macquarie Research: Great. Thanks for that. And also, if you could talk about your DRAM supply. If you were to take Inotera's impact out of both Q2 and Q3, do you think that your supply in terms of their growth was roughly within -- in line with expectations, or a little bit below or a little bit above?
Kipp Bedard: It might be a little bit below. As we have discussed in the past, we've been trying to enrich the mix, and generally, those are lower-density devices. And so you don't get quite the bit efficiency per wafer, for example.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Pitzer from Crédit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG: A couple of questions. Sorry if I missed it, but the server DRAM as a percent of overall DRAM, where did it stand in the quarter? And I guess, what kind of target should we think about as you exit the calendar year?
Kipp Bedard: John, I've got it broken out to total revenues, and we ran server about 20%. So pretty good business for us.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG: And I guess, Kipp, where do you think that could go as you guys continue to try to mix up the DRAM business?
Kipp Bedard: I might have to give that one to Mark to do a little more in-depth discussion around how he sees demand. We know that bit growth per system will be up about 60% to 65%. We know units in general, when inclusive of all the OEMs that are building servers themselves, are up double-digits. And Mark, if you'd like to add anything to that?
Mark Adams: No, it's consistent with the demand picture that we get for our products. And I'd say in the server business, we're mildly constrained around the capacity of those parts that could go there. We're trying to ramp that up in the coming quarter.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG: And then guys, in core PC DRAM business bits per box today, is price elasticity in that market done or we just dependent upon unit growth? Or how should we think about that?
Mark Adams: Well, it's interesting. If you went back a couple of years, when the ASPs of DRAM were significantly higher, we went through this destocking [ph] period due to the supply and demand imbalance. Since then, obviously, it's recovered pretty nicely, and we were just short of 4 gigabytes per unit in the desktop notebook environment. And it's projected to go over that threshold, which I think is the first time, at least that I can remember, there have been 4 gigabytes per unit. So our sense is that continues to remain progressively increasing and then favorable.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG: And then guys, my last question, and I appreciate this. There's probably not a lot you can say around this, but with the Rambus trial now moving forward, I'm kind of curious how we think about SG&A. And are there any milestones or timelines we should think about relative to that event?
Steven Appleton: Well, clearly, the Rambus trial started. It's a multi-month trial, and we'll continue to accrue litigation costs, as we have in the past. And that's really probably all we can say on the topic, because it's in flight.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG: But Steve, now that it could move to trial, we shouldn't expect to step up in increments? Or it's already embedded in the guidance you gave for the quarter?
Steven Appleton: Well, that's already embedded in the guidance we gave for the quarter. The length of trials are unpredictable, and as a result, that doesn't mean that we'll have some additional accrued litigation costs the longer it goes. But we'll just have to deal with that realtime as it's happening.
Operator: Our next question comes from Atif Malik from Morgan Stanley.
Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley: If I look at your guidance for NAND trade cost reduction last quarter, low to mid-single-digits and you ended up doing up 12%, are these decisions being made on the fly in the quarter to change the mix? And if you can give the percentage of SLC, MLC and TLC mix right now and what it will be by the end of the year.
Steven Appleton: So I'll take the first part about decisions being made on the fly during the quarter and change mix. The answer is, of course, we're trying to optimize margins in the parts. And as we see opportunity, we'll do that. Now also, I think in correlation, make the comment that sometimes it's easy to change the mix, and sometimes it's more difficult to change the mix, depending on the product and the category and so forth. And we also have customer commitments that we have to make sure we make. So all of that goes into the hopper. But we're cautiously looking at it. And for the next part, I'll turn it back over to Kipp.
Kipp Bedard: Yes, in terms of wafers probe, we saw a 26% increase in -- or 26% of our NAND wafers were processed in SLC in Q2. And of course, as those sell out, that would be into fiscal Q3, and that's why you saw the pretty nice increase in cost per bit. But again, referencing both what Ron and Steve said before, that also gave us the very nice margin lift and ASP lift as well. It's worth it for us to put as many wafers in that direction as possible.
Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley: Got it. And I agree, it's good for profitability. And what should we think about the kind of normalized SLC mix for the year? Higher than this level, about 26% for the year?
Kipp Bedard: This looks pretty flattish. As we mentioned before, IMFS is primarily ramping right now on MLC. So don't think that the wafers aren't growing in SLC. But as a percentage of the total, they're about flat in that 20% range.
Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And for the second half of the year, are there any underutilization charges at Inotera that could come up if the demand remains lower? Or you think you can still use Inotera for server demand and other kind of non-PC DRAM demand?
Ronald Foster: This is Ron. Your underutilization question was about IMFS, in particular?
Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley: For Inotera. I mean, are there any implications -- I mean, can Inotera load up the factory? Is this [ph] 100% utilization right now in Inotera?
Ronald Foster: Yes, Inotera's ramped.
Steven Appleton: Yes, they're ramped in wafers. They're still working on coming up the yield curve, et cetera, and get more good bit yields out for production. So no, we don't get specific underutilization charge. We did when it was shut down in 2009. But now we're just paying on a wafer cost basis and, as I've mentioned before, there's a cost basis and then there's a profit-sharing component that gets spread back.
Kipp Bedard: Thank you. And with that, looks like we're out of time. We'd like to thank everyone for participating on the call today. If you will please bear with me, I need to repeat the Safe Harbor protection language.

Steven Appleton: Thanks, Kipp. For those of you that were not able to make the call during the last quarter, I just want to remind everybody that we have a slight format change, and that is that I'm going to make some introductory comments, and then Ron Foster will cover some of the financial aspects of the release, and then we'll open it up for questions.  So to start with, I'd like to open on the topic of Japan. Our first comment, we're thankful that none of our employees were injured during these tragic events, and we hope the best for the people of Japan as they start the recovery process. But more specifically to the impact on Micron, I know people are trying to determine whether it's a positive or a negative for Micron, and unfortunately, I can't answer that for you, but I will comment on the things that we are evaluating.  First, our wafer fab operates more towards the center of Japan and away from the coast, and we did not sustain any damage nor did we experience any disruption on our production there. We do have a design center that's near Tsukuba, just outside of Tokyo, and as you might expect, we have some sales support offices in Tokyo, and they were both shut down for a limited amount of time. I think the greatest challenge there is they're experiencing what I believe most people are in the area, which is difficult transportation and rolling blackouts, which I'm sure is frustrating to a lot of people.  Now a number of our suppliers are in Japan, and they do range from chemical to materials to wafers, many of them supply us from operations they have outside of Japan but also as well from operations they have inside of Japan, and some of them were not impacted, and obviously, some of them were. Now we have a pretty complex matrix analysis on everything, as you might imagine.  And for the most part, the companies have been very open and they've been briefing us, really, daily or hourly depending on what the circumstances are. So our information is, obviously, only as good as theirs, and I think many of them are still trying to determine themselves what the best path back -- what is the best path back to full production.  Now also, as you might expect, we're filling gaps on an hourly basis where we might have holes. And as it's been noted, I think, in the media, most of us had inventory for the near term, but really, we still need a couple of weeks to understand what, if any, remaining gaps might exist. So we're working on it pretty diligently. We don't have any other information than that. And we think it's something that we're going to have to stay pretty diligent on and stay on top of, but that's what we're doing.  Now with respect to fiscal Q2, on operations and technology, we had a number of achievements I think worth noting. Probably the one to highlight the most is that IMFS is coming along ahead of schedule by about two months. Maybe hard to believe, but we're actually shipping now product from that facility.  And I'll probably take this opportunity to mention capital. So in our Q1 capital, the prior quarter was about $570 million. We made note that this was going to be our big capital for the quarter, our big quarter for capital. I know it was about $840 million, which is a little bit less than we thought. And as also happens occasionally, sometimes things get pushed into the next quarter just in terms of payments. So Q3, I think, will be similar. But IMFS is going actually so well that we're going to continue to drive pretty hard on getting capital in there and getting that facility ramped. So I think we're going to be on the upper end of the range that we had given you. We had previously told you $2.4 billion to $2.9 billion, I think we'll be on the upper end of that range for the year. But we feel pretty good about it because, as I said, the operation is going pretty well, in particular, IMFS. In fact, I think, it's also worth noting that 20-nanometer NAND still looks very good for ramp in the second half of the year.  Also, I would add that we completed our acquisition of TECH Semi. We owned most of it. We completed the acquisition of the rest of it, so we now own 100% of it, and it continues to operate pretty well.  Now switching over to a few comments on markets and product segments. Let me start out with the DRAM market. I think in our last earnings call, I noted that we did not believe that, say, winter quarter was going to be similar to the winter of 2007 or 2008. I think that's proven to be the case, and we're not suggesting that it was a picnic, as some of our competitors proved with the reporting that they did with some pretty negative earnings. But I think the downturn bottomed this last quarter. Also, we mentioned that we thought it would be at a lower environment for pricing for our quarter two, but it wasn't going to get worse. In fact, it didn't get worse, and at least for Micron, it's proving at least to be somewhat mild.  Clearly, I think that the new DRAM supply continues to be muted compared to last cycles. We've also made mention of that, and that's proven to be the case. It is true that Desktop continues to be somewhat weak. There are a lot of forecasts now that are pointing to something around 10% growth as opposed to some of the higher forecasts earlier, but I would remind everyone that content is still forecasted to grow 40%. And if you do the combination, that's still up 50%, or in some forecasts I've seen, even greater bit demand. So not too bad, really, for the weaker of the markets that we participate in, and all of the other markets actually look better.  So on the pricing front, we don't think it's going to go crazy. In other words, it's not going to go crazy up, but I will tell you that we do see a continued improving pricing environment through the rest of our fiscal year. And I think most of you have seen that immediate some of that's actually materializing now.  On the NAND front, I also mentioned in December that we felt we had a level where the NAND pricing would be pretty stable. Of course, it's fluctuated a little bit. It's gone up a little, it's gone down a little bit. For the most part, I think it's worthwhile saying that it has pretty much behaved as we would have expected it to, obviously notwithstanding the recent spikes due to the Japan effect. So Wireless, particularly the Smart phones, in terms of limit consumption, continues to look very good. I would also mention that our SSD shipments were up significantly quarter two over quarter one, and we see that trend continuing with quarter three. It's going to be over quarter two. And obviously, a lot of the news around tablets and those kind of devices are actually pretty positive for us in the NAND arena. So all those things added up look like -- all the demand signals going forward look pretty good for both the NAND and the DRAM environment.  On the NOR front, the embedded markets, we have the business groups now, which Ron will just mention in a second, but the embedded markets for NOR, DRAM and NAND all look good. And, I think, as you would expect and we've tried to communicate earlier, for the most part, we're pretty stable in pricing and demand. I will say specifically to NOR, we believe we maintained our market share, in other words, our market share leadership at NOR. Obviously, we saw some modest seasonal decline in fiscal Q2, but that's pretty typical. I think another highlight is that we sampled our 45-nanometer NOR products for wireless and embedded, and actually began our 45-nanometer NAND production ramp. So all of that's on a good note. So all of this leads me to my final comments, which, execution, our product portfolio strategy is working. We think we're in pretty good shape. In fact, we think we're in as good a shape as we've ever been coming out of a negative period. The demand signals from the majority of our customers are strengthening from Q2 to Q3. And I think we're pretty well positioned so that even with stable to moderately improved pricing, we should now start to build margin back into the financials. So all in all, we feel pretty good about where we sit.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Ron.
Ronald Foster: Thanks, Steve. The company's second quarter of fiscal 2011 ended on March 3. As usual, we provide a schedule containing certain key results for the second quarter as well as estimated metrics for the next quarter. That material is presented on a few slides that follows as well as on our website. The results for the second quarter include a $40 million gain in other operating income associated with the Samsung patent cross-license we discussed last quarter. A portion of this gain is reflected in the operating results for each of our reportable segments, as you will see later in the presentation. Recall that the final installment of $35 million under this settlement agreement is expected in the third quarter. The provision for income taxes in the second quarter is higher than what would normally be expected, primarily as a result of a tax rate change outside of the United States. This change caused a $16 million one-time write-down of deferred tax assets and, accordingly, is not expected to have a significant impact on the tax provision going forward. In addition, the tax provision includes the withholding tax of $7 million related to the Samsung payment under the patent cross-license. Total idle capacity costs, which are charged directly to cost of goods sold, were $36 million in the second quarter compared to $59 million in the first quarter. These costs are primarily attributable to the Singapore fab startup. In addition, pre-production costs at IMFS of $15 million were charged to cost of goods sold. We anticipate that IMFS will begin the inventory production costs in the third quarter as the initial products are qualified for sales to customers. NAND trade production cost per bit declined faster than NAND trade selling prices, while selling price reductions for DRAM products outpaced the cost reductions. The result was a compression of the overall company gross margin from 23% in the first quarter to 19% in the second quarter. As you recall from our Winter Analyst Day, we estimated DRAM production bit growth to average low-teens over the next three to four quarters. The second quarter actually came in above this range, at 23%. The higher bit growth in the second quarter along with a plan to shift for the product mix to higher-margin specialty DRAM products drives our estimate of low to mid-single-digit bit production growth in the third quarter. We also projected NAND production bit growth to average mid-teens over the next three to four quarters. The second quarter actually came in above this range as well, at 20%. We are shifting NAND mix to lower-density and higher-margin products, including SLC and NAND-based multichip packages in the third quarter, leading to bit growth in the mid- to high single-digit range.  Correspondingly, the NAND trade cost-per-bit decline in the third quarter is moderated in the low to mid-single-digit range as we shift to these higher-margin products in our mix. Bit production includes bits purchased from third-party suppliers, which may impact reported volumes and margins. To give you an idea of the general composition of our product portfolio, we have developed this high-level summary. As a percentage of consolidated net sales, DRAM comprised in the low-40% range, NAND in the mid-30s and NOR in the mid- to high teens as a percent of revenue. This quarter, we begin reporting financial results for each of our four business unit segments. The second quarter results for DRAM Solutions Group track closely with the DRAM product average selling price cost per bit and bit volumes I mentioned earlier. This resulted in revenue and operating income somewhat lower than prior periods. The DSG segment includes virtually all of the production volume from Inotera, which was relatively higher cost than the second quarter compared to other DRAM fabs as their production volume ramps.  NAND Solutions Group trade sales track closely to the NAND trends presented earlier, with revenue up quarter-to-quarter. NSG sales to Intel from our IM Flash joint venture were just over $200 million in the second quarter, roughly flat compared to the first quarter. Recall these sales are at long-term negotiated prices approximating costs. Wireless Solutions Group sales of products by architecture in the second quarter were NOR, NAND and DRAM in decreasing order of revenue. That's NOR, then NAND, then DRAM in decreasing order of revenue. A portion of NAND sold in WSG is supplied from Hynix at market prices. This supply is transitioning to Micron factories in the coming quarters, which we expect to improve WSG margin going forward. The Embedded Solutions Group sales of products by architecture in the second quarter were, in rank order, NOR, DRAM and NAND in decreasing order of revenue. Most of the inventory that was mark to market in the Numonyx acquisition has now flowed through. In addition, similar to my comments relating to WSG, ESG also acquired a portion of their NAND products from Hynix and are also in the process of transitioning to Micron-manufactured products. Now turning to operating expenses. R&D expense for the quarter benefited from development cost sharing of approximately $56 million from joint development programs. R&D expense as well as the cost sharing was reduced by the reimbursement of certain costs incurred under government programs in the second quarter. R&D expense is expected to increase in the third quarter to the $210 million to $220 million range, primarily due to a higher volume of pre-qualification wafers processed, notably 42x and 3x-nanometer DRAM and 20-nanometer NAND. The company generated $809 million in cash flow from operating activities in the second quarter. As previously reported, in the second quarter, we spent $159 million to buy out the other shareholders of TECH Semiconductor, as Steve mentioned. The accounting for this acquisition resulted in the $67 million increase to additional capital in our equity section. The cash and short-term investments balance at the end of the second quarter was $2.2 billion. In addition, we have restricted cash of $338 million separately presented on the balance sheet.  Now I'll close and turn it back to Kipp.
Kipp Bedard: Thanks, Ron. And with that, we'd now like to take questions from callers. [Operator Instructions] With that, please open up the line.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Glen Yeung with Citi.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc: Steven, your prepared comments, you said you were seeing demand signals improving. And I wonder if you could just give us a little bit more detail about that, one. And then two, let us know if you've contemplated the impact of Japan in those statements.
Steven Appleton: Let me first talk about Japan for a second. Mark Adams is here, so I might as well let him answer the question about the demand signals. We haven't contemplated, in thinking about Japan, whether that helps us or hurts us, because obviously, a competitor or two of ours, no doubt, has some supply issues related to that because they're in the area where it was impacted. And then, of course, you already know the counter to that, which is if customers can't get some components and they'd obviously be challenged in meeting other components. So that's hard for us to know. I remember -- I don't know if you remember, but probably not, the Sumitomo Chemical plant explosion, the mold compound which was, I don't know, 90% supplied out of that part of the world. It's probably worth noting, I think, that what we saw in that case and probably what we'll see in this case is that, most of the supply chain, most manufacturing operations had the ability to have an accordion effect. So in other words, we can run at near full capacity but run a lot lower cycle time, and so you can expand and contract the production to try to deal with shortages that come through at various times, so I think you'll probably see that through most of the manufacturing world. We'll know where they will expand and contract, and they'll run faster cycle times, stronger cycle times, where they're replenishing or trying to squeeze more products in the line. For the most part, I think if the effects are relatively short-term, in other words, a couple of months, a few months, then you probably won't see a whole lot of anything in terms of what happened in the manufacturing operations around the world. And if it affects them longer term, we clearly are going to have some impact. And those kinds of things we just don't know, and our information is only as good as probably yours on how that might impact our customers. Let me ask Adams to comment on the general demand signals and the rest of it.
Mark Adams: My comments will be obviously pre-Japan, just as Steve addressed Japan. We saw -- coming out of Christmas, which, again, normally is our weakest demand quarter, we saw pretty stable demand throughout the quarter, and in fact, post-Chinese New Year's, we saw a kind of an up-tick across a number of our key volume segments. The PC business in general was better than expected, and we're also seeing density inside the box getting increased back to even above where we were back in the de-specking phase of 2010, in the spring and summer of that. Our density per unit is back up, and so demand in PC commodity space is pretty strong for us. The server market as well from Micron when very healthy as a matter of fact as a percentage of overall specialty bits against commodity, it was up significantly for this quarter for Micron, so pretty strong demand there. And I would also point out that though server growth overall is not -- it's in the 6% to 7% range year-over-year in terms of unit growth, but density per server is dramatically up, it's around 50% to 60% per box. So there's some good growth there and good demand from our customers in that area. Obviously, the Numonyx acquisition has opened additional customer opportunities around the wireless segment for us and they are certainly manifesting themselves both across newer applications and then DRAM, MCP Solutions with NOR and NAND Solutions. So I see a pretty good demand to the quarter which enabled us to perform pretty well at the top line.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc: Maybe a quick follow-up, because, Steve, I wanted to clarify on something you said earlier. With respect to your ability to manage your production in light of an issue, I think you said maybe a couple of months you can handle it. I just want to be clear on -- just some precision there. Is it something like about eight weeks where you feel like, all right, I can manage the fabs at this point for about eight weeks, and I got to start thinking a little more carefully after that about shortages? Or do you have a number like that in mind?
Steven Appleton: Well, let me first comment that precision in this environment is just unachievable, number one. Number two, what I was referencing was that -- well, actually, you made a comment that probably would be good to add some additional input on. Number one, most of the companies, us and others, carry a couple of months of inventory for most of our processes and products and so forth. So we all still have that. So I think the reference point that for a couple of months, it's unlikely most companies see much impact is probably true, at least in the semi industry, I can't speak for other industries, at least in ours. But secondly, even when you get shortages at some point in time of supplies, you are able to dial your manufacturing operations to actually just run faster cycle times, because the way most of the fabs operate, at least in the memory world, is they're full capacity because there was maximum utilization of the capital. And the way that we achieve that is we make sure that every piece of equipment has material waiting for it to run. And what happens when you're starting a wafer fab, by the way, as we're experiencing IMFS, when you start up a wafer fab and it doesn't have that much material in line, or when you run into a situation where you maybe you have some kind of shortage on something that you were expecting to get that you actually did speed the cycle times up in those fabs. And so the output isn't quite optimized, but it's not like you take the same percentage hit as the shortage of the material, and that can last for some period of time. And then it's only after that, that you then have to start dealing with two choices. And of course, we have no idea whether that's going to hit us [ph] or not.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Freeman with Gleacher.
Doug Freedman - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: Ron, would it be possible for us to get the rank of gross margins? DRAM, NAND, what was the highest? And then if I could focus in a little bit on it sounds like you're changing strategy there on NAND, looking to go to some higher-value product. Can you give us the gross margin effect that, that should have?
Ronald Foster: Yes, I'll give you a rough ordering, specialty DRAM tends to be the head of our list. Trade NAND is doing quite well for us and probably next in rank. NOR clearly and the vast majority of our NOR products, and then core DRAM in sort of that rank order. Just to elaborate a little bit, though, on your line of questioning, we are seeing market opportunities, as Mark mentioned in his comments, to shift to higher-margin products in the specialty end of things, both on the DRAM side and on our NAND product side in the third quarter, and we're opportunistically shifting some of our mix, which is affecting our bit growth and cost-per-bit computations that we typically give you, but I just wanted to make sure you understood that we're doing this strategically to help improve margin. And it's the right thing, given the balance of mix we need for our customers.
Doug Freedman - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: And could you help walk us through a little bit of -- you mentioned pretty quickly there in your prepared remarks about the accounting treatment for the startup of Singapore and your startup costs. Can you walk us through in a little bit more detail and offer some color on how we should think about those startup costs accounting playing out over the next couple of quarters?
Ronald Foster: Sure, there's a couple of pieces this quarter. There's true idle costs, which were about $36 million in the quarter for the company. The vast majority of that was IMFS. And then there's another $15 million which we characterize as pre-production startup costs, and that's resulting from the fact that we're now actually starting wafers, as Steve mentioned, and beginning to move up the production curve. So both those pieces are expensed directly to cost of sales, and so you can compare to the prior quarter's idle costs that were about $59 million. But bear in mind that those $15 million of costs relate to the variable materials, et cetera, that are used to start our production ramp in IMFS. So what's going to happen here beginning in the third quarter is as we qualify production, which we expect to do, as I mentioned, in the third quarter or beginning of the third quarter, we will start inventorying some of those costs, and they will go into our inventory on our balance sheet, and they will move out when we ship the qualified products. So we will not be directly expensing all of the costs as we begin to qualify product, which I would view as beginning to happen in the third quarter and then significantly in our fiscal fourth quarter.
Doug Freedman - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: Just so that I understand correctly. So then when that inventory cost flows out of the operating model, it will be at a lower-than-corporate-average gross margin or normal gross margin?
Steven Appleton: As gross margin presumes an average selling price, so I need to just address it on the cost side. We use a moving average cost system, if you will, so we'll be -- and we're already beginning to ramp costs. So we'll be moving it into our inventory at an average cost trended over time, if you will, and that will be in our inventory cost structure. We do not tend to inventory the full cost when you have a significantly higher ramp cost. We inventory it at a somewhat lower level. So as that goes out, it will depend upon the average selling price, but we would expect it to have a typical relationship to our normal flow of business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shawn Webster with Macquarie.
Shawn Webster - Macquarie Research: I guess, first of all, on end demand going into in Q3. Can you give us a little color on what you're hearing from your OEMs in terms of what you're expecting for calendar Q2 bit demand for DRAM and maybe even which end markets you're seeing the most strength in going into fiscal Q3?
Mark Adams: From a demand standpoint, I think, what we're seeing quarter-over-quarter is in the mid-teens, more or less. We see no reason, per Steve's earlier comments, that there will be a lot of variability around that number in general. And then the NAND market continues to look pretty strong around the, obviously, the Smart phone market to tablet segment as well SSDs.
Shawn Webster - Macquarie Research: So mid-teens DRAM bit demand growth, is there any particular end markets, whether its networking and server, core PC, that's the strongest for you?
Steven Appleton: Well, I think for us, again, this is all kind of on a proportion basis, the server and networking markets showed significant strength over the end of our Q2 and have continued to show strength going into Q3. So we're continuing to be very bullish on those markets. And as I mentioned earlier, despite the fact that the PC numbers are down off of maybe last year's 2011 projection, the density per box is making up for that loss, and we see PC business is still fairly robust for us as well.
Shawn Webster - Macquarie Research: Can you share with us your expectations for cost-per-bit reduction in Q3 for NAND and DRAM?
Ronald Foster: Yes, Shawn, we're looking at down high single-digits on DRAM and down low to mid-single-digits on NAND.
Shawn Webster - Macquarie Research: On terms of the production, so you had a really strong quarter in Q2 on your production. You're expecting that to slow down in Q3. Can you flesh out what you think the next couple of quarters are directionally, excluding the Japan impact, on what you're expecting for a sequential bit production?
Steven Appleton: Not much impact from our Japanese production facilities, and we'd be back to that guidance that Mark set at the Analyst Meeting, which is kind of low-double digits in over the next three to four quarters.
Shawn Webster - Macquarie Research: On the DRAM side?
Steven Appleton: That's correct, mid-teens on the NAND.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kate Kotlarsky with Goldman Sachs.
Kate Kotlarsky - Goldman Sachs: I wanted to ask a question on content per box. I think Mark talked about content per box starting to increase nicely. And I wanted to get your thoughts on how you're thinking about content growth for the remainder of the year. Given that pricing is now stabilizing and potentially moving up, do you think that might actually have an adverse impact on content growth?
Mark Adams: Kate, this is Mark Adams. I think that that's unlikely. We're not talking about the dramatic uptick in price that we saw back in 2009 going to 2010. Remember something, as our cost in DRAM goes down, even as we think pricing will be more favorable in DRAM over the next coming quarters, we don't think the impact in the building materials anywhere as significant as it was back when it was $2.50 per gigabit, a deal we had. And so we don't anticipate any downward trend in density per unit going throughout the rest of our fiscal year.
Kate Kotlarsky - Goldman Sachs: And then maybe just one other question on IMFS. You talked about the ramp progressing faster than you had expected. Are you guys still targeting that 60,000, 65,000 wafer starts per month by the end of the year or has that number now gone up?
Mark Adams: Well, no, we're still targeting that. Actually, even if we decide to go beyond that, it's unlikely we could have it happen before the end of the year because just ordering cycle time of the equipment. So that's a good target to use for now, and as we've noted before, we're just going to watch the markets as we go through time, but we're trying to get to that 60,000 as the first benchmark.
Kate Kotlarsky - Goldman Sachs: And just a final question. Can you remind us when the first quarter is when your output share of IMFS is aligned with your ownership share? I know there is a 12-month lag there.
Ronald Foster: Kate, this is Ron. It depends upon the timing of capital injections, which happens every several months, and there's an approximately 12-month lag effect per the agreement in terms of the share changing. So here this summer, we'll have the effect of the first capital calls where our partner didn't fully participate, and it will sequence from there. But right now, we're at about 78% ownership and our output share is about 53%, and that will ratchet up in significant steps here starting in the summer.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Berenbaum from Auriga USA.
Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA LLC: Can you talk a little bit about maybe guidance in the Wireless and embedded segments? I was just sort of parsing through the data sheet here. And can you then talk about -- the Wireless profitability obviously seems fairly low. Can you talk about how that business trends, both in terms of revenue and profitability, over the course of maybe the next year, year and a half or so relative to the embedded group?
Steven Appleton: Danny, we're going to stay away from any guidance at the BU level. Now if you'd like Mark Adams to talk a little bit about the wireless segment in general, we're happy to do that. We're going to stay away from any projections and guidance on the BU level.
Mark Adams: I might just add a couple of things I mentioned in my comments, and that is that we are still flowing through higher cost purchase accounting inventory, which is significantly hitting WSG. I mentioned that's significantly through as of this quarter end. And now it's going to tend to be a longer trend line and not have as big an effect on our financials. So there was an impact in both WS and ESG businesses in terms of the purchase accounting effects. I also mentioned that there's Hynix material volume that is being purchased at market price, and we're in the process of transitioning over some of that NAND volume. And as that happens in the coming quarters, it will improve the margin, everything else being equal. So those are two things to keep in mind that are currently impacting that will change here in the next coming quarters.
Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA LLC: And then maybe just to follow up in the Other segment, is that basically all imaging? Or is there another component to the Other segment?
Steven Appleton: That's things that aren't of significant enough size to warrant a segment treatment by the normal tests, but it does include Aptina imaging, display, solar activities, that sort of thing.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG: Steve, getting back to the issue of Japan, is there a concern that memory doesn't become sort of the bottleneck component of the system, it's something else? And in that situation, do we have to worry about inventory being built in memory in the calendar second quarter which will have an adverse impact on pricing? How should we think about that?
Steven Appleton: I didn't hear the first part of your -- can you repeat the first part of the question and what would have an adverse impact?
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG: Let's assume that memory isn't the gating factor for getting systems shipped out the door, it's another component. Is there a risk that we see an increase in memory inventory for the industry? How do we think about that dynamic?
Steven Appleton: Well, that's a tough one to gauge, because, clearly, there's going to be some impact on supply of memory. I mean, I think if you look at where some of the large fabs are, despite the fact that some of them didn't go down hard, those of us in the memory business know that all you have to do is have a couple of hours of a problem and it takes you several weeks to recover. So there's going to be an impact on the supply side. And to the extent that there's something that happens that impacts it on the demand side, which I noted in my opening comments, that's just impossible for us to predict. We just don't know how that sorts out and the pluses and minuses on it. And actually, I don't think it's, as I mentioned earlier, probably not a phenomenon in the next 30, 60 days. It's something after that, if in fact there even is an effect.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG: On the operating margin side by business unit, where does this Samsung settlement kind of get accounted for in those buckets?
Steven Appleton: It's actually spread, because it's a broad-based license among all the businesses.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG: My last question, just on DRAM mix, can you help me understand PC, server and mobile in the quarter just reported? And I guess, when do you expect to be able to ship server-ready DRAM from Inotera? And help me understand how that might impact the mix if server starts to grow?
Ronald Foster: Again, John, we're looking at qualifying the Inotera output sometime in the second half of the year. In terms of a breakout of sales, we're running around 25% to 30% of our bits in PC, around 25%, maybe even a little bit lower last quarter. It should ramp up a little bit this quarter, but in that mid-20%. Server, we generally run about twice our market share. So if we're running 15% to 18% worldwide market share, we're generally running in the 30%s in terms of server market share worldwide. And networking, we'll do about the same thing. We're also outrun our market share in those markets also.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG: And Kipp, anything meaningful in mobile DRAM yet?
Kipp Bedard: Coming out of Inotera?
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG: Out of Inotera, out of Micron itself. Is it a big enough percentage of the DRAM business to start breaking out?
Kipp Bedard: They just began running mobile wafer starts this month in Inotera.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee.
Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: I was just trying to figure out, when you look at Japan, going back to that, how much of the wafer supply on your DRAM, NAND or NOR comes out of Japan?
Ronald Foster: We have pretty minimal exposure to wafer supplies specifically out of Japan. We carry about five different suppliers. Different competitors we have do have a much larger, as Steve mentioned in his opening comments, exposure to Japanese facilities.
Steven Appleton: Yes. Even the supply that we have from one of the larger Japanese guys actually comes from the U.S. player.
Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: And on the NAND side, can you talk about the Singapore fab? How far is -- how much does it facilitates now? And the second part is, you mentioned 65,000 wafers additive incremental for the second half. If it is SLC, that should obviously be much lighter on the total bit count that you are seeing, right?
Steven Appleton: You're breaking up a little bit. We're not going to give you the exact number of outs today, but suffice it to say, we're about two months ahead of what we thought the RAM schedule would be. And if you'd like to repeat the second half of that, we'll cover it.
Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: I'm just wondering, if we assume 65,000 wafer starts incremental from the Singapore fab, if it's -- a lot of it is SLC, the bit growth probably is not as strong overall, right?
Steven Appleton: Are you asking between the relation between SLC and MLC?
Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: SLC and your wafer starts. If it's all MLC, 65,000 wafer starts, that will be a lot of bit growth, but if it's SLC, probably not have much bit growth.
Steven Appleton: That's correct. You have the right ratio. MLC would certainly increase that, as would TLC.
Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: I'm just trying to figure out how the supply on the NAND side would look in the second half, so...
Steven Appleton: It'll be increasing for us.
Operator: Next we have Uche Orji with UBS.
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank: Let me just start off by asking you about SSD. I think in your prepared remark, you talked about SSD growing really fast demand. From a consumer standpoint, I'm not quite sure I know as that of Apple, I don't see many SSD-based notebooks in the marketplace. But can you just talk about what's been driving the demand there and how sustainable that is? I mean, we had only expected that NAND flash prices need to go down significantly to drive SSD demand, but that seems to be happening. So any comment as to what's driving that, given how we're seeing NAND flash price have been, would just be helpful.
Steven Appleton: I think one underlying piece of the SSD solution was the underlying controller development that had to go on over the last couple of years to get that market going. So we talk a lot about price per gigabyte and the value proposition to the consumer. And in fact, the notebook segment is still driving that growth, by and large, although enterprise is starting to play off pretty nicely, as I said, because of the technology development around intelligent controllers and firmware development around making these things more reliable from an enterprise requirement standpoint. So the markets are pretty strong. The OEM segments are good. And we also suggest that the aftermarket, integrator environment [ph] market, has proved to be very successful for us so far through the Lexar and Crucial channels. So I guess the combination of some OEM desktop pre-configured machines as well as some aftermarkets that have combined for some pretty impressive growth, at least from what we see internally as well as the upside forecast for the back half of the year. I think enterprise is now becoming more real in terms of the opportunity for us as an industry to put the devices in the back end of the major companies that have the reliability and performance benefits that we've counted all along.
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank: And from what you're seeing, obviously, that seems to be a trend that will continue through the rest of the year. Is that how one will read some of these trends you just mentioned?
Steven Appleton: Yes. I think we're very optimistic about the market potential that we've seen so far, both in the OEM segment and the channels. So yes, we don't see any reason that would stop. Actually, again, I think the reason we're bullish in the enterprise, I think the enterprise game is just starting, because the technology around the flash itself, which Micron invested in over the last of couple of years, is mature enough to bring to the enterprise.
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank: When you were making comments about NAND in your prepared remark, you seemed very positive in terms of how you expect pricing to develop through the rest of the year. I mean, embedded in that, obviously, is that you have thoughts on supply from the rest of the industry. So any comments you can make as to what you think the supply demand dynamics are for NAND flash through the rest of this year? And also within that, you talked about tablets a lot. I mean, there are concerns about the non-Apple iPad tablets not selling through. If that were to be really the case, does that affect your expectation for NAND price development through the rest of this year?
Steven Appleton: I think how we look at the demand market is that you've really got three pretty significant application drivers lining up at once, and that's why I think in general the market has been bullish on NAND going into 2011. We haven't changed our position because, in fact, when you break it down, the Smart phone market is still driving significant NAND demand. The SSD market is really playing out pretty nicely this year, and we feel bullish, as to my earlier comments. And then the tablet market, really, has been a very pleasant surprise from a NAND perspective year-over-year when you think about where it was just 12 months ago. So when you line that up, given the NAND supply picture for 2011, we're still bullish on NAND in general. I think you asked about the last part, if I understood correctly, was with regards to if tablets don't manifest themselves to be as strong as they look right now. Of course, that potentially could impact demand. But we think NAND in a pretty good place, it would have to be pretty dramatic. And remember, of the three categories, the tablets would be the lower of the consuming categories.
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank: And just lastly, if prices were to hold steady from where they are now, what will be the change to ASPs for NAND, DRAM and NOR by the end of this quarter?
Ronald Foster: We have a flat DRAM quarter to date, and we have NAND up a couple of percent.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: On your strategy for moving to more specialty DRAM and also to higher-margin NAND flash, how quickly can that reverse? Is this a permanent change or -- and I guess maybe it's along the lines of questions that you always had about converting from NAND to DRAM. Can you do same with the specialty going back to core DRAM?
Mark Adams: This is Mark again. Steve, in prior calls, has mentioned that the NAND business looks like the DRAM business from early generations of the DRAM and the market behavior. And in fact, I think we're seeing that. I think if you look at what I would call generation one of NAND, that was primarily photography USB with a little MP3. And now when you think about it, NAND is the effective storage platform for Smart phones, for tablets and moving into notebooks and even enterprise storage. So the maturity of NAND and the role it's playing in storage will allow us to treat that in terms of more specialty value-add that Micron can bring in addition to the silicon itself. And so I think that's been a good thing. You can see we feel pretty confident that our mix will continue to improve over time. We've talked a little bit about why we've stayed so focused on 2-bit technology in addition to our leadership position around the 25-nanometer offering and why we stayed with 2-bit because of performance and all the specifications we're trying to drive with our customer applications. We continue to believe that regardless of how we transition, and we are transitioning into 3-bit, the value-add is around the NAND, not just the NAND itself. So that will continue for Micron. On the DRAM side of the business, it's really, one, around the opportunity we've cultivated in the past, very strong server share, very strong networking share, and those are two businesses that continue to grow nicely for us from a density per unit, and really just overall units out the door. So we're positioned well in those segments, and I would continue to think those are options for us to grow.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Maybe if I could turn to Inotera, is their supply chain very similar to your internal supply chain, or do they have exposure to Japan also?
Steven Appleton: Well, in some ways, I think there are similarities, but they actually, I think, have less exposure to Japan than we do, just because traditionally, we've had good relationships with Japanese companies over several decades. And they, as I said, they actually have less reliance upon Japanese suppliers than Micron does.
Operator: Our next question comes from Manish Goyal with Crest Investments.
Manish Goyal - TIAA-CREF: I have a question on mobile DRAMs. Can you maybe give some color where you see your internal capacity or your wafer allocation going for mobile DRAM and specifically what densities you are targeting?
Steven Appleton: Manish, we're not going to give out any specifics. We certainly don't want to give our strategy out to competitors, who are certainly most listening to the call. So if you like to answer or ask a different question, feel free.
Manish Goyal - TIAA-CREF: Perhaps can you give some color as to how much mobile DRAM do you procure from the open market today?
Steven Appleton: How much what from the open market?
Ronald Foster: Manish, you're referencing the Hynix relationship, is that the question?
Manish Goyal - TIAA-CREF: Yes.
Ronald Foster: Yes, because they're trying to match that up traditionally with what the Numonyx business was. I actually don't know right offhand myself.
Mark Adams: We buy a little bit of outside DRAM that goes in the mobile applications, but that's -- we're transitioning out of that, as I mentioned, along with the NAND over the next several quarters. There's not a lot.
Manish Goyal - TIAA-CREF: So I'm just trying to understand that over the last several quarters or years you've talked a lot about mobile DRAM, but we've not really seen a whole lot of progress. So where and when is the inflection point and what really triggers that?
Steven Appleton: Well, I think a couple of things to point out. One is that mobile DRAM, in terms of the consumption of it, has obviously predominantly been and is occurring in terms of densities in the Smart phone arena. And if you look at what's happened historically, it hasn't been that long ago since they started converting to a NAND-DRAM combination going in the MCP, which has been addressing the higher-density needs in the wireless space itself. Previous to that, it would be the relatively low density. And by the way, we are one of the largest pseudo-static RAM suppliers in the world, which is really just DRAM with a static RAM interface. We were one of the largest suppliers in the world and have been for a long time, and almost all that product was going to the Wireless space. So I guess I would characterize it a little bit differently than you did. I think what you're specifically referencing is what they characterize as kind of the low power, high-density DRAM stuff. It hasn't been in the Wireless space in large amounts for all that long a time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Betsy Van Hees with Wedbush.
Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc.: First and foremost congratulations on the quarter. I think this is kind of a historic moment for you guys. Isn't this the first time that you've ever been profitable during a DRAM downturn?
Steven Appleton: Actually, we were able to basically break even in 1990, 1991 in a mild downturn that occurred then. That's the last time that it happened, and even then, we weren't really profitable at the time of this breaking even, but we stayed positive and that's the first time it's happened. I think the other thing that's I guess worth noting is that, clearly, we just came out -- we think when volume is in downturn and we we're able to maintain -- I guess this is our sixth quarter of real profitability, and we think it improves from here throughout the year.
Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc.: If we look at DRAM, I would imagine with gross margins around 19% that, that was probably the pretty much the significant drag on margins. And as we look at the mix going forward, how can we look at -- I know you guys don't like to give any type of guidance in terms of gross margins, but how can we look at that in terms of getting back to maybe where you were in fiscal Q2 of last year. How does that going to help us -- how can you help us when we're modeling?
Steven Appleton: A couple of things. One, remember that, along the lines of what Mark said and we said earlier, is that we don't need rising pricing in order to build margin in. We're going to continue to drive the other cost per quarter, so even flat pricing, our margin will expand from where it's at. Secondly, I don't think there's any question that, as Mark Adams already noted, that the PC space in terms of the margin, as you already noted and highlighted the drag on us in our margin, and we actually think we're in an improving environment in that space too. So that combined with -- I think we would also acknowledge that we haven't fully optimized the DRAM operations around the world yet, and there's still some progress we made there. I guess the way I'd characterize it is there's some runway left there in addition to our normal cost reduction. So when you add all those up, I guess I think that's how you ought to think about in terms of modeling us going forward.
Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc.: And then I want to take another run at the mix of MLC versus SLC. If we look at your production today, can you give us the percentage that is SLC? And as you exit the calendar year, what do you expect the percent of SLC mix to be?
Ronald Foster: I'll tell you where we are today, but we probably won't give you the exit because we will continue to optimize for the market. We run about 95% MLC today, about 5% SLC.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bobby Gujavarty with Deutsche Bank.
Bobby Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank AG: I was wondering if one reason for your confidence in content-per-box growth, is it really enterprise client? Do you guys see that refresh continuing? And I think that's a higher content per box and a consumer box. Could you comment on that?
Steven Appleton: Yes, I think you're spot on. I think we think of the two, the enterprise refresh is definitely driving that net growth and the overall market condition.
Bobby Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank AG: Just one thing, if you could help me make sense of this, I noticed in your breakout sheet, you had trade NAND ASPs were down 12%, and in the press release, they mentioned that NAND ASPs were down 4%. I assumed your trade NAND always has a better ASP performance than your overall NAND. Maybe I misunderstood that. Could you help explain the discrepancy?
Ronald Foster: Yes. This is Ron. The trade NAND ASPs are, in fact, the movement of our markets in the NAND marketplace. And the total includes our at-cost shipments to Intel, which are moving with our cost-down movements relative to the products that we ship to them. So when you look at the total, you've got the combination of those two movements going on. That's why we're also focused going forward on giving you a trade NAND view of what's happening with our trade market and also the cost per bit related to our trade NAND production, because there's a significant change and a difference in terms of our mix of products versus Intel, for example. We mentioned that we have significant SLC mix we're shipping to in the third quarter. We've got MCP volumes, which also report in our NAND sales volumes. And so all that factors into the trade ASP numbers we're giving you for Micron, and the average is the mix of those two. It's the cost on Intel shipments and the trade pricing on Micron shipments.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Gauna with JMP Securities.
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC: I believe it already got asked, but it wasn't clear to me. In terms of you moving more to SLC, how large is that addressable market? How well can it absorb your increased supply, and how is it that we've seen the pricing move, with you guys at only about 5% of production in SLC, that you weren't there for in terms of this past quarters and the run-up into it?
Steven Appleton: I think the question around SLC for us is, in those certain high-performing markets that really warrant both the opportunity cost of making the product around the performance we're being asked to hit in terms of specifications from our customers. So markets like high-end enterprise SSD performance will be looking at how SSD -- I mean, sorry, SLC plays in that architecture potentially in a combination with a an SLC, MLC architecture, those types of things we're evaluating from a technology standpoint. So it's really basically the opportunity cost to manufacture it versus what we can garner in the market to justify that production to us.
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC: Are you aware of your any competition making similar moves, or should we feel pretty good about the ability for this market to absorb your moves?
Steven Appleton: Yes. We see other players looking at it, because, again, when you look at the enterprise storage market, this is not a glorified USB. This is something that's very sophisticated, much different than the pure NAND players understand. And so why we haven't been so big on the 3-bit-per-cell campaign up until today is because performance, reliability and endurance around the enterprise sector is going to make a winner from a solutions standpoint, and we're very focused on not just the NAND, as I said earlier, but all the technology that goes around in making a world-class product, and that's going to be more in the SLC type architecture or high-performing controllers or the combination thereof.
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC: And do you think -- just one last one on this topic. Do you think that you can get those SLC gross margins towards what you're experiencing with the specialty DRAM at the top of the stack?
Steven Appleton: Absolutely, especially in enterprise. If you look -- Alex, if you can -- and you probably know this better than I do, but if you look at the projections for SSDs in general, while the revenue is very heavily weighted towards the desktop client segment, the overall projected margin profitability by analysts suggests that the enterprise margins can be dramatically higher, and almost we could get to a 50% of the overall category margin.
Operator: Our next question comes from Win Cramer with Avian Securities.
Win Cramer: Just one quick question on DRAM production. Can you talk about, as a percentage, what is produced at 5x nanometer and 4x nanometer?
Ronald Foster: Yes. This is Ron. Looks like that 5x nanometer, we're running in the neighborhood of 85%.
Win Cramer: And can you talk about the transition schedule to 4x and then possibly 3x as well?
Ronald Foster: Yes, well, obviously, we're in transition to 4x now which is running in production. I think we would expect probably a majority of that to cross over towards the end of this year, sometime second half of the year would be the majority. And then we also happened to be currently running the 3x. But there is -- associated with that with qualification and getting it throughout our wafer fab network, and certainly that wouldn't occur in terms of large volumes probably until we get into the next year.
Win Cramer: Is that end of the fiscal year or calendar year?
Ronald Foster: With respect to what piece?
Win Cramer: The 4x, you said you'll be there by the end of the year?
Ronald Foster: Yes, our fiscal year.
Win Cramer: And my last question for you. You hinted towards the fact that you're making progress with TLC. Is that going to become more of a staple year business, or still 2-bit MLC all the way?
Steven Appleton: Well, I think, yes, I think, as I was suggesting earlier, the challenge for NAND manufacturers in general is, how do you keep the endurance and the performance at an acceptable level for the application where the parts are going? Historically, TLC has been pretty low-end performance, cycling well below 2-bit per cell. And so what has to occur in the industry, and then again I mentioned again that Micron has invested pretty heavily around controller and firmware development to enable this, is that, that has to become more of an intelligent controller for things like error correction that allows us to gain the performance levels needed for things like SSD and things like Smart phones and the mobile wireless market in general. So we believe that our road map will continue to evolve, utilizing TLC as we've grown in this area, but we only believe that we're getting there today, we didn't think we missed a big market opportunity in the past.

===== 2010 Q4  (2010-10-08 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Johan and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Micron Technology's fourth quarter and fiscal year-end 2010 financial release conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host Kipp Bedard; you may begin your conference.
Kipp Bedard: Thank you very much and welcome to Micron Technology's fourth quarter and fiscal year-end 2010 financial release conference call. On the call today is Steve Appleton, Chairman and CEO, Mark Durcan, President And Chief Operating Officer, Ron Foster, Chief Financial Officer, and Vice President of Finance, and, of course, Mark Adams, Vice President of Worldwide Sales. This conference call, including audio and slides, is also available on Micron's website at Micron.com. If you have not had an opportunity to review the fourth quarter and fiscal year end 2010 financial press release it is also available on our website at Micron.com. Our call will be approximately 60 minutes in length. There will be an audio replay of this call accessed by dialing 706-645-9291, with a confirmation code of 14483222. This replay will run through Thursday, October 14th, 2010, at 5:30 p.m. mountain time. A webcast replay will be available on the company's website until October 7th, 2011. We encourage you to monitor our website at Micron.com throughout the quarter for the most current information on the company including information on various financial conferences that we will be attending. Please note the following safe harbor statement. During the course of this meeting we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company and the industry.

Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of the presentation to conform these statements to actual results. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Appleton. Steve.
Steve Appleton: Thanks, Kipp. I also want to thank everyone for joining us today. We are going to proceed a little differently than in the past with the conference call. We thought the end of our fiscal year would be a good time to announce a change in the format for our earnings call. As you know, historically we typically covered some of the details of interest regarding bids, ASP, costs, etcetera in a verbal format. We've decided to present that information in a posted slide concurrent with this call so that you can simply reference it rather than having to ask about it and providing more time for other discussion. And we have a couple of charts we’ll show here as we speak that reference that. So in consideration of this, Ron will still provide color to some of the financial information, but he's no longer going to simply repeat what was in the press release or the posted financial statements. As some of you know, we reorganized the company in an effort to better serve our mark and, of course, the integration of Numonyx provided the perfect opportunity to implement this. We now have four main business units. We have what we call DRAM Solutions Group, or DSG. We have NAND Solutions Group, which is NSG. We have a wireless solutions group, WSG, and then we have the Embedded Solutions Group, which we call ESG. And we are going to be reporting on these market segments beginning with our fiscal Q1 release. In other words, the next time we have a conference call we'll report by market segment, and we set the target and the finance team is work diligently on being able to do that. We're still evaluating the type of hysterical – hysterical? Sometimes it's hysterical. We are still evaluating the type of historical information that we – we have historically provided in combination with the market reporting. Moving forward, you need to give us a quarter to work through that because obviously there's some market segment data that's required by the accounting regs, and we want to combine that with enough information around some of the more detailed bid, cost, etcetera, data to allow you to build your models. And we realize that you need some combination of both, but give us a quarter to sort that out. And so as an example, this quarter Ron is going to break out the Numonyx results separately from Micron's, but that will not be possible moving forward because of integration. In other words, we will not be running the business in that form nor will we be recording data on that basis. And in consistent with this change now we're going to adjust the discussion during the earnings call to add more general trends and the way we would characterize it as technology, operations, and market. Other executives in the future may cover these topics, but with that in mind, let me turn to those areas. On technology and operations, during our fourth quarter, we managed through a number of technology transitions and more notably, it's, I think, pretty apparent that we've been migrating from Inotera’s DDR2 products to Micron stack DDR 3. The cost of manufacturing for Inotera product in the fourth quarter continued to be higher than in other Micron facilities and this is a result of the lower yields and lower total output, but as of today, Inotera has substantially completed the conversion and they're now focusing on increasing wafer starts to full capacity utilization. The majority of this increase as you might imagine takes some time to flow through the facilities as expected to show up in our second fiscal quarter and there forward. On the NAND front, we began volume shipment of our industry leading 25 Nanometer technology and that was across our OEM customers as well as our retail businesses. On the markets, – demand perspective, as some of you no doubt have been reading in the media, we did see softening towards the end of our fourth quarter in our notebook, desktop, commodity DRAM businesses and forecast through the back half of this calendar year from our PC customers has come down from what we earlier indicated when we last shared our information for the third quarter. It appears that some of the demand is being driven by unstable consumer sentiment which there's also been a lot of media about, but also some of the softening in the desktop notebook space, I think, can also be attributed to the success of the tablet PC category. And the Smartphone segment is also growing, I think having some impact there as well. However, I think to our benefit this is a first full quarter with an integrated Numonyx product portfolio, and that includes the DRAM NAND and NOR-based solutions. Clearly the breadth of our product line has changed the way our customers depend on Micron. I think the benefit to Micron is continued diversification away from a commodity-based business to a broad set of solutions that serve markets like computing, networking, mobile, server space, automotive, et cetera, and, of course, consumer electronics being a large part of that. It's also worth noting that Micron's percentage of business from our commodity DRAM business is now less than 25% of our overall revenue, and for those of you that have followed Micron for awhile, that's down from around 45% in the first half of fiscal year but more importantly it's pretty stark contrast to previous cycles in the 90s and the early 2000s where Micron was virtually 100% leveraged to the PC. A final comment before I turn it over to Ron. We also filed today an 8-K that announced a cross-license agreement with Samsung. That resulted in $275 million that will be paid to Micron during the next couple of quarters, and if you – if you want more information about that, you can go to the filings and read the detail on that. And so, as I mentioned earlier, we will provide more color by market segment as we move forward. I will now turn it over to Ron to add some commentary on the financials, then as Kipp mentioned, we also have Mark Adams, Mark Durcan on the call, and all of us will be available to answer questions after Ron's comments.
Ron Foster: Thanks, Steve. The company's fourth quarter and fiscal year ended September 2nd, 2010. Our press release is available on our website along with a schedule that posts certain key results and estimated metrics for next quarter. We've summarized that material on the following couple of slides, which we'll continue to show here. Total idle facility costs which are charged directly to Cost of Goods Sold were $40 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $18 million in the third quarter. A significant portion of the idle facility charges are included in NAND costs and relate to the start-up activities at that time IM Flash operation in Singapore. A richer mix of products and higher costs associated with our 25 nanometer production ramp impacted the otherwise improving cost trend. The decline in NAND bit shipments was a product of timing of shipments to our customers and an increase in finished goods inventory. We expect to see much of this inventory to sell through in fiscal Q1. First quarter NAND cost reductions are expected to be down mid-to-high teens and bit production up mid-to-high teens. Production increases are largely coming from continued transition to our 25 nanometer process technology which is expected to cross over and become the highest NAND production in the first quarter. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $338 million. The SG&A and R&D spending of Numonyx is included in Micron's consolidated results for all of Q4 compared to roughly one month in Q3. Recall that SG&A expense in the third quarter included expense for litigation accruals of $64 million. R&D expense in the fourth quarter includes costs related to higher volumes of 42 nanometer DRAM prequalification wafer production. R&D expense for the quarter benefited from credits of approximately 50 million from joint development programs. The fourth quarter R&D expense exceeded the estimate given at the beginning of the quarter primarily as a result of the timing and classification of these prequalification wafer production costs into R&D rather than into Cost of Goods Sold. The company generated $1.1 billion in cash flow from operating activities in the fourth quarter. This was the highest quarterly cash generation in the company's history. This comes at a time when the company has generated record levels of revenue, income, the cash flow for a fiscal year. Clearly 2010 was year of outstanding financial performance for Micron as margins on our primary products were leveraged to generate substantial levels of profitability and cash flow. Micron's free cash flow significantly outperformed the market at 2.15 billion in fiscal 2010. We exited the fiscal year with a much stronger balance sheet, $3 .2 billion in cash and investments including 335 million in restricted cash, while debt was reduced by $640 million. As a result of purchase accounting for the Numonyx acquisition, the margin on Numonyx sales in the fourth quarter of 21% was lower than the actual margin, but still higher than our single-digit expectation at the beginning of the quarter, primarily due to a change in the mix of products sold and lower production costs. As I mentioned, the Numonyx results are included in Micron's consolidated results for all of the fourth quarter. As with last quarter, there are a number of adjustments made in purchase accounting that distort the actual results from what they would have been had the purchase accounting not occurred. The GAAP Numonyx results for the fourth quarter included revenue of 555 million with gross margin of approximately 21%. Normalizing for the purchase accounting adjustments, revenue would have been 602 million with gross margin of approximately 31%. We are continuing to work on the integration of Numonyx into the company's operations which will likely include the redefinition of our reportable segments as Steve mentioned. Accordingly, we don't anticipate providing these stand-alone Numonyx results in the future as we won't be able to separately measure those legacy operations. As you recall, Hynix had certain rights that were triggered with the change in control of Numonyx. In August, Numonyx' interest in a joint venture was sold to Hynix and the supply agreements with Hynix was renegotiated. The company received a total of $423 million from the sale of which 250 million was deposited into a pledge account, collateralizing the joint venture’s $250 million bank debt. The $250 million is classified on our balance sheet as restricted cash while the remaining 173 million is reported in cash and cash equivalents. When we line up the fourth quarter results to the prior quarter, and adjust out the non-recurring items noted in the non-GAAP reconciliation that should be on your screen, we show non-GAAP diluted EPS for the fourth quarter of $0.37. This compares to non-GAAP third quarter diluted EPS of $0.47. Now with that, I will turn it back to Kipp.
Kipp Bedard: Thanks, Ron. We will now take questions from callers. Just a reminder, if you are using a speakerphone please pick up the handset when asking a question, so that we can hear you clearly. With that, please open it up to questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Daniel Berenbaum with Auriga USA.
Daniel Berenbaum: Yeah, hi guys. Thanks for taking the call. Can you talk a little bit about the technology cross-license with Samsung? What drove Samsung to want to pay you money for your licenses? Was there a specific technology that it was driver for the licensing, or was there a specific catalyst that was the driver for that?
Steve Appleton: Yeah, it's a general patent cross license. I think it's just recognition of the portfolio that Micron has, and it's a 108-k [ph], it is a 10-year cross-license.
Daniel Berenbaum: So I mean, can you be a little bit more specific about, was there a specific driver? You know why now as opposed to some other time? Is there a specific technology that drove that?
Steve Appleton: No, there's not a specific technology, and I think if you're trying to determine if there's some kind of technology transfer that occurred in association with it that did not occur, either. With respect to timing, I guess it takes two parties to go through a negotiation, and timing happens whenever it happens.
Daniel Berenbaum: Okay. I guess really what I'm trying to get at is, sort of obviously Samsung licenses from other folks as well, and Samsung has a tremendous amount of its own technology, and obviously you're getting some technology from them as well. Really I guess what I'm getting at is, you know, is there specific roadmap item that you felt you needed from Samsung or that Samsung felt that they needed from you, and as we think about the transition, you know as we shrink DRAM NAND down to the 2X nanometer nodes are there technology transitions that you are thinking about that are critical to the manufacturer of any of your devices moving forward that require some sort of change in technology, change in process?
Steve Appleton: Alright, No, other than, of course what we do ourselves to advance our own technology. This was a general broad portfolio cross-license, and Micron, as you know has a very, very strong portfolio.
Daniel Berenbaum: Okay. Thanks. I asked a lot of stuff there. I'll let other people jump in.
Steve Appleton: Okay. Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer: Yeah, good afternoon guys and thanks for giving us the (inaudible) but just one clarification. Historically when you have kind of talked about current quarter ASP trends you have talked about what pricing would do if it were flat from sort of today's level. But I am just kind of curious when you look at the fiscal first quarter guidance you're giving for DRAM and NAND ASP, is that under the same sort of category or is that what you expect for the whole quarter?
Ron Foster: Same category, same as we've done in the past.
John Pitzer: Okay. And then on the CapEx number, is that a total CapEx number including what may or may not be contributed by joint venture partners, or is that the Micron out CapEx number?
Steve Appleton: That's a gross CapEx number. So dollars that we received from the joint venture partners is – or the CapEx that we would expend, I guess, on behalf of all of us in total, joint venture partners that's in that number.
John Pitzer: And then I guess my last question, when you look at sort of the DRAM supply growth for the industry, clearly calendar third quarter, calendar fourth quarter, pretty significant sequential big growth, and there's a lot of concern as to whether DRAM prices might bottom. I am kind of curious, how do you think your cash costs compares to the leaders in the industry and then some of second tier guys and I guess the other issue is that the calendar fourth quarter seems to be a pretty heavy debt repayment load for some of your competitors, and I'm kind of curious as to how you think that might influence the decision about running fabs down to cash costs or not?
Steve Appleton: Yeah, well, first of all, it's hard for us to know others' exact cash costs. You guys are probably better than us at going through the analysis on that, clearly we continue to look at our competitors. When you say leaders in the industry, I mean we really think that Micron is probably one of the top leaders in the industry. The thing that you have to keep in mind when you try to run through those calculations are that we – our portfolio is really quite broad. In fact only Samsung and Micron have the kind of portfolio we do. So, when you talk about cash costs regarding what we call legacy products or specialty products, those products are not driven by cost reductions they're typically now driven by performance and features and reliability and delivery, and etcetera. So you have to exclude those from the conversation because there's really only two of us that have those. With respect to – I think what you're getting at, which is the – kind of the core high volume DRAM that's going either into the PC space or in some applications in the mobile space what is our cost on those products compared to others in the industry, and if you look at the facilities that run those products for us, of course, they're all 12-inch, and if you look at the technology deployed, not what people are saying they're going to deploy, but what they actually are deploying, then we think we're as good as anybody in the industry.
John Pitzer: And then guys, I guess my last question maybe for Ron. Just help me understand, I know you're not going to, on an ongoing basis, talk about Numonyx as a separate entity, but relative to the inventory that you had to write up at the time of the acquisition, what's the first quarter where you think that fair value inventory will no longer be running through your P&L.
Ron Foster: John, it's a little hard to exactly predict the timing. Some flow-through obviously in the fourth quarter, there will be more of a flowing through in the first quarter and ongoing. I recognize there's a little challenge when we're switching gears to track where things are going, but it will certainly be affecting about the same level in Q1, and I expect the economics to be roughly the same in Q1 as you would see. We just will have trouble breaking it down into the legacy components that we've been reporting to this point.
John Pitzer: Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kate Kotlarsky with Goldman Sachs.
Kate Kotlarsky: Hi thanks so much for taking the question. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the cost reduction roadmap in DRAM in past the November quarter. What are you guys anticipating for the February quarter on the cost reduction side?
Mark Adams: We have – you know we have got a pretty good roadmap ahead of us, Kate. As Steve alluded to in his comments, Inotera has now really turned to ramping wafers back up. And you will start to see the full impact of that capacity becoming much more cost effective for Micron in the fiscal second quarter so two quarters out. Cost reductions generally, probably mid-to-high single digits for DRAM moving into fiscal Q2. And lots of runway ahead of that again. If you think in terms of technology on the DRAM side, we are now in the early stages of the 40-nanometer ramp occurring in Micron site in Singapore. That will start to kick in like also in fiscal Q2 in a significant way moving to fiscal Q3. And we have obviously the ongoing transition to 50 nanometers of Inotera RAM.
Ron Foster: Mark, if I can add to that too, Kate, keep in mind Mark's comments about the DRAM cost per bit includes all DRAM. So there obviously will be more aggressive cost reductions on the core DRAM as Steve mentioned earlier.
Kate Kotlarsky: All right, so but in total for February, you still think it would be something in the high single digits, not more than that?
Mark Adams: Yeah, I think that would be a good place hold.
Kate Kotlarsky: Okay. And then can I ask a question on you know the R&D spending? You know it was quite a bit higher than what you guys had expected and sounds like you're keeping it at similar levels for next quarter. How should we think about R&D maybe going beyond November?
Ron Foster: Kate, first of all, I will comment on what happened in the latest quarter. We have sometimes difficulty calling exactly where our pre-qual wafer timing will play through and which quarters it will hit, especially if it's transition over quarters and we can accelerate or decelerate those plans as we flow through our pre-qual activities in our fabs. So it was mainly just the timing effect that happened in our R&D, and that is which is the one element of our R&D costs that's a little hard to predict. But if you look forward from there, we now have the R&D costs from former Numonyx activities as well as Micron, and we're projecting roughly in the same range of 195 to 205 kind of range for R&D spending in the next quarter, and that's sort of the range that we're seeing right now. It can be lumpy because of pre-qual costs and how they flow through in a particular quarter.
Kate Kotlarsky: Okay, and then maybe one last question for me, and you know recognizing this is a little bit far out, but if you think about your margins in the February quarter, you know what would be ASP environment, and your bit growth have to have look like for margins to be moving up from the November quarter into February?
Ron Foster: Kate, I think we're going to stay away from make any forecasts on as you know revenues and/or margin.
Kate Kotlarsky: Okay, thanks so much. That's it for me.
Ron Foster: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Gauna with JMP Securities.
Alex Gauna: Yeah, thanks very much for taking my question. I was wondering if you could give some color. Steve, I believe you mentioned some of the strength that tablets may have seen in the past quarter, and maybe Rob from consumer PCs. How do you feel with regard to your mix exposure to tablets and/or Smartphone at present?
Steve Appleton: I'll let Mark jump in, in a second, Mark Adams, but I'll just make one observation because I think that this is a concern that's been actually voiced by a few, which is the stronger that the tablet PC– or the iPad, the tablet PCs are, the more pressure it puts on DRAM because less bits consumed in those compared to some of the more traditional notebooks or desktops, and there's, there's – I think there is some – there is some truth to that, as I noted in my opening comments, although we're – we also believe there's some incremental demand that comes from that. But, having said that, you know what's interesting is, the, the more of those that are sold – in fact, I saw a, I heard a statistic yesterday, when I was in Washington, D.C., from one of the other large players you know in the desktop, notebook, PC space, and it commented that, that their finding from the data on the network of the access of these systems, that if they actually own an iPhone and an iPad, that the – there's a much greater preference to interact with the network on an iPad than there is on the iPhone, and it is probably even if they have both, for obvious reasons, because of the quality of the display, etcetera. And, and the reason I bring that up is, every time that that happens, it means that more data has to be moved and stored somewhere, and the more that that happens, the more servers, the more networking, the more infrastructure you need in order for that to happen. So, you know, oddly enough, the, the infrastructure business, and, again, I will let Mark comment more on that, I think is, is better, and actually pretty good compared to what we're seeing happening in the PC business. And so there's a balancing act that happens there. And then on top of that, of course, it definitely drives the consumption of NAND. I don't think there's anybody debating that. That the more success that those have drives more and more NAND consumption, because obviously desktops and notebooks don't drive a whole lot yet until they start to consume a lot more FSGs. Mark?
Mark Adams: Just one last comment is the, the exposure that we have in terms of customer opportunities, both in mobile and PCs, if you look at Smartphones bypassing PCs in 2012, but still a pretty healthy PC market, we think that the NAND upside is very strong. And as, as Steve said, the impact on our infrastructure businesses, server blade, server markets, enterprise market, and networking market is very positive, both for DRAM and even substantially NAND around solid state. So when we net it out, it's, it's pretty exciting growth opportunity downstream.
Alex Gauna: Is there any way you could quantify what sort of server momentum you saw in the past quarter?
Mark Adams: Yeah. When we talked about where, Steve's comment earlier on the desktop notebook was – we saw some softening demand, we didn't quite see that in the server space. Server for us held pretty steady both in terms of units and overall ASP.
Alex Gauna: Okay, thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Glen Yeung with Citi.
Glen Yeung: Thank you. Can you talk a little bit about your fiscal year CapEx and how you will sort of apportion that between your various lines of business?
Mark Durcan: Yes, this is Mark, Glen. It's – it's two-thirds NAND. A lot of it is associated with ramp of the new fab in Singapore, and the rest distributed between the other fabs for technology upgrades.
Glen Yeung: And maybe – is there, is there a part of that that's NOR for this year that wasn't there last year that makes the number looks like it's going up a lot?
Mark Durcan: There – that, that's not driving any significant change in the number, but, yes, there is a small amount of technology upgrade associated with NOR.
Glen Yeung: Okay, relatively small, though. And then another question is, just getting a sense of, now that we're in an environment where DRAM is – ASPs are coming down in – at somewhat healthy rates, are we seeing any change in the bit per box loadings because of that? That's sort of point one. And then the second thought here is, if we look out into the February quarter, and you make the point that you will start to see more output from Inotera at that point, and if we talk to some of your competitors, it sounds like that's around the time that some of the shrinkage activity ought to be hitting. Is it a safe assumption that, given seasonality, DRAM prices ought to continue to be falling in the February quarter?
Mark Adams: I think with regard to your question on density, I think we start to see some holiday configurations that are very favorable to DRAM increases, and mind you, if you look at the data over the last couple quarters, it still has been positive in terms of growth on the PC unit and DRAM megabit – megabyte per box. So it might have slowed down mildly, but it wasn't so significant on the despecking argument over the last couple of quarters. And, and of late we've seen, again, some, some larger configurations for, for holiday placement.
Mark Durcan: With respect to what happens with pricing in February, I don't think anybody really knows for sure. I would point out that nothing has been normal in the last couple of years or in the pricing environment. In fact, it was – I think everybody was a little bit surprised by the strength of the pricing if you go back to last February.
Glen Yeung: Right.
Mark Durcan: And I think you're right, typically you would expect some seasonality weakness around the December-January time frame in particular, and then some strength moving into the back-to-school Christmas season. Obviously we're not seeing that. In fact, when I spoke if you remember, in the summer, we met with – you know we had an analyst day, and I was in New York, and we weren't seeing any weakness at that time. I, I admit I'm a little bit surprised by the weakness right now, but I'll also say that I think we experienced a supply-driven recovery, given all the damage that occurred in the industry, and right now, we are experiencing a demand weakening environment, and how sustainable that is, whether that plays out, it's too hard for us to know, because clearly the economy is playing a role in that. I will say that if you look at most of the regions around the world, we tend to get caught up in the US. But if you look at most of the other regions around the world, even in Europe, Germany's GDP looks pretty good their employment rate is back down to pre-crisis levels. UK seems to be doing okay. So there's some, some, something going on in Europe that's positive. But with respect to Asia, it's still pretty strong, and so I think that's adding some strength to the overall market as well. But in aggregate, it's just too difficult to know what's going to happen in February, whether we do get some economic growth in the US to help bolster that or whether we don't. And, and I don't think that, I don't think that the environment is such that we – it has to be, it has to happen, something has to happen on the demand side for, for what I would consider to be a strengthening of pricing. I can't really comment on – a lot of parts of our business are pretty good. So it's hard to comment on whether or not, in aggregate, our business will weaken from where it's at or whether it just stays where it's at. It's just too hard to predict. But, but, you know, I guess only time will tell.
Glen Yeung: That's fair enough. Just last question is, when you think about your full-year production numbers, can you give us a guesstimate on what your bid forecast – or your bit production growth you expect to see in DRAM and then NAND?
Steve Appleton: Yes. For the full year, I think a good place holder would be we expect to grow roughly with the market. So in the 50, 55% range on the DRAM side; maybe 70, 80% on the NAND side.
Glen Yeung: Perfect. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line from Shawn Webster with Macquarie.
Shawn Webster: Thank you. On the, on the wafer, now that you have added the Numonyx factories to your overall wafers, can you tell us what your wafer growth did sequentially?
Ron Foster: It would be up a couple of percent, Shawn.
Shawn Webster: It was up in August a couple percent?
Ron Foster: Yes.
Shawn Webster: Okay. What do you expect it to do in the November quarter?
Ron Foster: Pretty similar, up just a couple percent.
Shawn Webster: Okay. And then what are your – you mentioned your OEMs, their targets were coming down in the back half of the year Are they, are they giving you any guidance as to what to expect for bit demand sequentially for calendar Q4?
Mark Durcan: Well, I'm assuming is it's – you're asking about DRAM, and it's mid-teens.
Shawn Webster: Mid-teens?
Mark Durcan: Yes.
Shawn Webster: Would you characterize that as fairly normal?
Mark Durcan: Probably not. But to Steve's point, there's kind of – what's the new normal? We had a strong first half in demand, and coming out of that, the mid-teens is probably less than we would have projected mid-year, but that's what we see going into the holiday season.
Shawn Webster: Okay. And then on the Samsung royalties, do you have plans for how to account for that? Is that going to hit your balance sheet, or roll through your income statement somehow?
Ron Foster: Yes, well it's going to come in three payments, essentially in the first quarter, and the vast majority will be booked directly on income in the first quarter.
Shawn Webster: Okay. Will you recognize that as a revenue, or just income line item?
Ron Foster: Other income, probably.
Shawn Webster: Okay. And then, can you give us your view on channel inventories right now for both DRAM and NAND?
Mark Durcan: Yes. General inventory on DRAM is up about, up a little bit in the four week to five week time frame, although I would note that that's more generally categorized around DDR3. DDR2 is in pretty, pretty good balance for us, and both pricing and inventory have stayed relatively lean. On the NAND side, it's up slightly, a little bit less than the DDR3 growth, I'd say around three to four weeks.
Shawn Webster: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Uche Orji from UBS.
Uche Orji: Thank you very much. Can I just ask you about what you have seen for demand trends for some of your non-commodity, DRAM businesses so, things that go into mobile DRAM and server networking? So any comment as to what you saw in the quarter ending September 2, 2010, and your outlook for the upcoming quarter for those markets, please?
Mark Durcan: Sure. So, specifically to the wireless mobile space, it continues to be pretty strong for us. Obviously the Numonyx acquisition in addition to our portfolio strengthened our ability to serve that market, and we continue to see strong demand around the Smartphone market, and I think we – we're pretty well positioned there with higher density products and our MCP lineup. If there's any, if there's any story around less of a growth, it would be more on the low end of the mobile market, but even that, we're still seeing some pretty good signs there. So mobile in total is pretty strong for us. In some of the other markets we serve, I mentioned earlier, that the server market remained pretty strong for us through our fourth quarter, and then quarter to date. Networking, very similar. So I see, all in all, non-commodity businesses have remained relatively strong for us.
Uche Orji: Okay. Let me switch gears a little bit and ask you about in terms of your retail business with – for Lexar. Some of the comments have been essentially about weakness in retail for NAND product. So any comments you can make on your Lexar business on the retail side? And as I look at your projection for price decline for NAND next – in the current quarter, what, what should we think – how should we think about your cost decline as a transition to 24 nanometers, you know just to get a sense of how the margins for that business will hold up? Thank you.
Mark Durcan: Sure. A general comment on retail, there's a lot of data out there, but back-to-school seemed to happen just late, and it wasn't all that bad. Actually, there was a report out this morning that Reuters that same-store comps were up over analyst projections, I think it was 2.8% growth on same-store US – US retail comps. So in general, retail has been okay, and I would say that's about what we felt from, from the Lexar business in the channel. The overall trend going into holiday is relatively stable for us, and Lexar had a pretty good fourth quarter. As a matter of fact, the year that we just finished was the best year we've had since the acquisition into Micron. So when you look at some of the products around USB storage devices and micro SD serving a growth oriented mobile market, it's – we're more bullish on the retail space than maybe, maybe someone look at that just the raw desktop notebook market.
Uche Orji: Okay. And then just one last question. Can you just comment on the target capacity for IMS and in terms of build out, and installation, and also, are there any, do you see any lead time issues on the equipment side? That's my last question. Thank you.
Mark Adams: This is Mark. So we've said a couple times, the full capacity of that site is roughly 100,000 wafers a month. We will probably get about two-thirds of the way through that in 2011, and we'll be monitoring market conditions, obviously, as we move through the year. But that's sort of where we're heading to in terms of the next year. Relative to equipment, obviously the steppers have been a – at least in different pockets, steppers have been subject to schedule slips. We're pretty comfortable right now with, with our own deliveries and where those are going to fall relative to supporting the ramp and the technology migrations we have.
Uche Orji: Great, thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Luke with Barclays Capital. Tim, your line is open.
Tim Luke: Thank you very much.
Operator: Tim, your line is open.
Tim Luke: Thank you very much. Thank you. With respect to your licensing and royalty revenue, as Inotera begins to ramp, how should we think about that revenue line developing? And do you have any clarification as to what it was in the quarter?
Ron Foster: Tim this is Ron. Yes, the licensing revenue in the quarter was about $50 million that hit the R&D line. As I mentioned last quarter, commentary, we've got some shifting from revenue into R&D credits. So that's about the same as last quarter in terms of the impact on the R&D line. And there were a few million dollars still flowing through the revenue line. So that's the rough sizing of it, and, and going forward, we will see the vast majority of the credits coming through the R&D line as we flow through the year.
Tim Luke: Secondly, just with respect to the expense – operating expenses, Ron, how should we think about those as you go through the year? Do you think it can be fairly flattish from what you're outlining for the first quarter? Do you have to grow the R&D?
Ron Foster: Yes, we are not guiding out beyond the next quarter, but if you look at our long-term modeling, we've targeted roughly OpEx in the 15% kind of range. We're doing substantially better than that and with the leverage model we have in R&D with the credits that we were just talking the about, I think we'll be tented on the low side of that and roughly the same kind of range.
Tim Luke: And with respect to NOR, could you give some guidance on how you perceive the environment there going forward in terms of the bit growth or ASPs? Should we generally think about as flattish on both counts? How should we think about that business?
Mark Durcan: I think you categorized it correct. I think it's pretty flat, both on the ASP side and growth.
Tim Luke: Lastly, if I may, just as a general question for Steve, obviously as ASPs decline, you're seeing nonetheless quite strong cash flows. Given the cost structures that you see, and expectation of a pretty mixed environment on the demand side, do you believe there's a fairly high level of confidence that will you be able to stay with an operating profit through the current cycle of softness? And what are the key factors for us to watch over the next several quarters as the ASPs decline seasonally? Thank you.
Steve Appleton: Yes. The – obviously we can't share our internal forecasts, because we don't give financial guidance, but our operating cash flow we believe will still be pretty strong through the next twelve months, and we have modeled in declining ASPs. But having said that, let me just point out again that less and less of our product is in the volatile commodity ASP arena. So we're less affected by that today than we were several years ago, than we were ten years ago. So – and we've proven, I think, in the last cycle, by the way, we were – again, we don't know Samsung's numbers, because they don't break them out, but other than that, if you look at the, in particular, the DRAM business, we were the only company that remained that positive operating cash flow through the entire cycle, on a quarterly basis. So we feel, we feel pretty good about that. I think that the number, or the category that is probably the one to highlight is what is our operating cash flow and what is our free cash flow. And I made the comment, in the summer, that we are not going to take all the cash that we generate and spend it all. So, as opposed to maybe historical circumstances for us. So, we expect, again, we don't forecast, but we expect that with the models that we have, that we will continue to look pretty strong on generating cash throughout the, throughout the next fiscal year.
Tim Luke: Thank you, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee.
Vijay Rakesh: Yes, hi guys. Just a – I'm going back to the memory side. Just wondering on the non-flash side what is the exponential big growth on the ASP?
Mark Durcan: We're going to – I think we answered that a couple times, didn't we?
Vijay Rakesh: I might have missed that, sorry about that, but –
Mark Durcan: Would you like to try again?
Vijay Rakesh: Yes, I was just wondering what the non-flash guide was for the next quarter where the big growth in the ASPs were?
Ron Foster: Well we, again, we just said that we think that they will be relatively flat from where we are today.
Vijay Rakesh: Okay, got it. On the DRAM side, you mentioned the ASPs coming down mid-to-high teens and your cost reductions mid-to-high single digits. On the cost reduction side, can you, can you go over what the cost reductions vary in-house and in Inotera?
Steve Appleton: Well, first of all, just to clarify, when we talk about the ASPs coming down, or the cost reductions coming down, we're referencing our entire DRAM portfolio, which incorporates legacy products, and differentiated products that don't really have that much cost change over time, because that's not role that they play for us. And then when you reference the mid-teens on the DRAM, you're then referencing – or, or we were referencing this mainstream core volume DRAM that goes into a certain market segment. So you can't correlate those two, just to, just to clarify. And then in terms of cost reductions moving forward, we – because of the, some of the challenges that Inotera had historically, obviously as Mark Durcan noted earlier, they should get on a pretty good cost decline curve going forward from where they're at now. Having said that, we're also working on cost reductions and converting to advanced technology internally with respect to our DRAM. And I don't have a number to break them up between the two, as to what contributes the greater, to the cost reductions, but keep in mind there's a large percentage of our portfolio that isn't even the category. It's getting watered down and averaged out for the numbers that were shared earlier.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo.
David Wong: (inaudible) of bit shipments through the August quarter, what you're expecting, going forward? Because if July was actually looking quite firm, that suggests there were 12% sequential drop in unit shipments – August must seem particularly weak. And have you seen a rebound since then?
Steve Appleton: I think Mark would, would mention that we saw the back-to-school season happen later. Mark, maybe you'd like to go on with that. But we did, in essence, David, we missed part of that what would be typical or normal demand for back-to-school in the August period. But, Mark, maybe you'd like to add more to that.
Mark Durcan: Yes, that's true. And I think some of the timing of our output coming out of the fabs allowed us to serve that from a production shipment. So, when you couple those to a later back-to-school on the timing of our, our fab output, that put us in a position to catch up and see what we achieved for the quarter and at the end of August.
David Wong: Right. And then – going to your comment about the weaker DRAM inventory in the channel being up four to five weeks, now, your shipments were actually very low, again, given that bit decline. So do you reckon that your competitors shipped a fair amount more than you into the channel?
Mark Durcan: Yes, we do – we did see that. The other – the other thing is that we're, we monitor the end of the quarter activity. Our customers, especially some of our channel customers, are pretty good at predicting when our fiscal periods end and what we have in terms of quarter end deals. So given, given that we're heading into the holiday season we weren't in a rush to liquidate inventory at depressed pricing relative to market pricing. So a combination of those two facts, from additional inventory in the channel from our competitors and us holding back some inventory for major customers, OEM customers for Christmas, holiday purchases, we thought we were doing the prudent thing.
David Wong: Right0. And my final question, I think – just a clarification on what I think you said in the past, your CapEx plan, that does not include any CapEx for Inotera, is that right? That's completely separate from the CapEx?
Ron Foster: That's correct, David. It's consolidated operations. Where we fully consolidate we show all our CapEx. If we're an equity investor, as with Inotera, we do not show the CapEx in our CapEx numbers.
David Wong: Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bob Gujavarty from Deutsche Bank.
Bob Gujavarty: One clarification. You mentioned NAND bit growth for next year for Micron as being maybe in line with the industry at 70 to 75%. I would intuitively think that would you outgrow the industry given, given the ramp of Singapore. Are there some puts and takes I'm missing?
Mark Durcan: It's just that we reference a fiscal year number. And, as you know, we'll be ramping up the, the Singapore plant from the summer on. So a lot of our bit growth for next year comes, comes into the second half of the year which does not, is not included in our fiscal year guidance numbers for you.
Bob Gujavarty: Okay. That makes sense. And, as a clarification on the DRAM side. Sounds like, just from your comments, that enterprise, in terms of servers and clients, is reasonably steady. Typically, in the calendar fourth quarter is enterprise benefit from a budget flush? And do you anticipate your own bit growth intake on an enterprise climb in servers growing in kind of the calendar 4Q?
Mark Durcan: Well I think the demand appears to be consistent with your reference on whether it's attributed to budget or just overall healthy demand. We're seeing a very healthy demand, and we're going to continue to supply at the levels that our production output allows us to do. We have very strong demand from our customers as we see through the end of the calendar year.
Bob Gujavarty: Thanks and just one final, real quick one. I think earlier in the year you were a bit constrained on the server side. Are you constrained at all on products for that market now, or –?
Mark Durcan: It, it's still something we work every day on to make sure we get as much of the product into the, into the high end applications as possible.
Bob Gujavarty: Great, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Dezellem with Tieton capital.
Bill Dezellem: Thank you. We have a of couple questions. First of all, with the recent softening of demand, how does this qualitatively, if at all, impact your thoughts about CapEx in fiscal '11, specifically for Micron? And do you have any sense at what impact it may be having on the industry's thoughts about CapEx?
Steve Appleton: Yes, the – well, Bill, the, the range that we gave is pretty wide for a reason. Because, as Mark Durcan noted, we're going to keep our eye on it pretty closely as we move through time. So, we, we obviously have the commitment to the initial piece of IM Flash in Singapore, but, but really on the margin, we can, we can dial around that in these other facilities and deploy more, deploy less, or even deploy more (inaudible) to take the capacity up higher. We're just going to keep our eye on market conditions. I will note that I read yesterday morning, Elpida's announcement to defer some of their CapEx in this environment. So I think that if you look at the strength of the balance sheet, Micron and Samsung are clearly the strongest in terms of cash and net cash after debt and debt payable in the next twelve months and so forth. And we have the luxury to – I think add some or delete some on the margin and not have it really affect the balance of the – the strength of the balance sheet. I don't think that's true for several of the, for several of the other producers, that they really will need to react pretty quickly to any change in type of demand environment in order to keep their balance sheet even, even viable.
Bill Dezellem: That's actually a good segue to the second question which is industry consolidation. There is, there is more chatter in, in the popular press now about further consolidation. What, what insights do you have relative to Micron's stand on the issue and view of what may be take place in the industry?
Steve Appleton: Well, I – first of all, it's hard to get consolidation in a, in a rising positive environment. I said that many times before, and you'd be pressed to show me an example of that occurring when the markets are good, depending on what segment it is. And so I think that the problem of that occurring in a really strong environment was low. Clearly we've had some weakening. For us, it's really only been in one of our categories, but nonetheless, it's the primary category for some of the other producers in the industry, and I will also note in the media that (inaudible) from Elpida made a number of statement, whether they're accurate or not I don't know, because I don't know if he's quoted correctly by the press, but where he, he commented that he was looking to buy into a couple companies in Taiwan in order to try to get more access to capacity or get more scale or something. It's a little hard to determine exactly what he's trying to do sometimes. But regardless, we're obviously in all the markets around the world, and we'll continue to look at opportunities that arise. Again, I think if you look at our historical transactions, we do them because they make us more cost effective, because they give us a much more efficient capital deployment model, and to the extent that those rise, we'll continue to look at them. But, you know, the environment right now isn't what the environment was eighteen months ago, not even by a stretch. So we'll have to see how that unfolds, Bill.
Bill Dezellem: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tristan Gerra with Robert W. Baird.
Tristan Gerra: Hi, good afternoon. Could you give us little bit more details on the 42-nanometer transition and the potential mix we can expect at end of fiscal '11?
Mark Durcan: Sorry, we had trouble hearing you. I missed the second part of that But relative to 42-nanometer transition on DRAM, I can tell that you we – as we said, we ran more 42-nanometer than we originally anticipated last quarter, and we're anticipating a ramp that will begin the quarter we're currently in, in one of our manufacturing fabs. We already have output in Inotera that was impressive, I think. I think everyone was, was happy with the early results out of 42-nanometer in Inotera. So that's, that's really a – probably a fiscal Q2 and beyond story for Micron I'm going to play out throughout the fiscal year.
Tristan Gerra: Okay, and, and any estimate in terms of the mix it could be by end of this fiscal year?
Mark Durcan: It kind of depends how we do at Inotera. That's a big piece of our total volume. For the, for the Micron facilities, by the time we get to the end of the year it will actually be a mix of, of 42, we'll have some 3X in there as well, and that'll, that will depend on how that goes. But I'd say, for the Micron internal, it will be north of 50%, and for Inotera, it will be in the similar range.
Tristan Gerra: Okay. And then finally, if, if we assume a normal seasonal decline in pricing in NAND flash over the next couple of quarters, is that enough to, as an incentive for Smartphone OEMs, tablet OEMs to double content of NAND flash for next year, model introduction relative to what we're seeing the second half, or do you feel that there is a need for a steeper decline curve in pricing for that to happen?
Mark Adams: Let me repeat that for Mark. I think he had a tough time understanding it. I think the question was based on do you need additional pricing pressure in order for the stronger markets to double memory content next year. Did I summarize that right?
Tristan Gerra: I think that was perfect.
Steve Appleton: I think we're starting to see that happen already, and I think part of which is given some of the seasonality, and I think part of which those, those customers that – those customers that actually did do the despecking pass didn't quite benefit from it on the, on the sale into the channel and the customers. So I think you are going to start to see it sooner than, than you might think going into the holiday season.
Tristan Gerra: And how about for NAND?
Steve Appleton: NAND to me, today, if you, if you isolate the mobile and the SSD business, you've got a bunch of consumer applications driving NAND that I don't think it will impact as much. On the SSD front, absolutely, I think the pricing will help increase density per box, or per drive, and on the Smartphone as well. I think what you'll see a number of Smartphones with a number of different players coming out with increased density.
Tristan Gerra: Great, thank you.

I’d now like to turn the call over to Mr. Ron Foster. Ron?
Ron Foster: Thanks, Kipp. Our press release is available on our website. It has been a busy quarter with the Numonyx acquisition and other items. Let me first set the stage with the financial summary for the quarter. Then I will review with you some of the significant or unusual items in the quarter before diving into the operating details. The company’s third quarter fiscal 2010 ended June 3, 2010. The company reported net income of $939 million or $0.92 per diluted share on net sales of $2.3 billion. Included in net income are gains related to purchase accounting for the Numonyx acquisition aggregating to $488 million. Of that gain 437 million is presented on a separate line on the income statement and 51 million is reflected as a benefit on the income tax line. In computing earnings per share, the shares issued in the Numonyx acquisition are included only for the period they were outstanding, roughly 4 weeks out of the 13 week quarter. Now let us look at some of the significant or unusual items that arose in the quarter starting with the Numonyx acquisition. The purchase price for Numonyx is based on 130 million shares issued to the Numonyx shareholders and consideration for the employee holders of restricted stock units that were assumed by Micron. The total purchase price was $1.1 billion. The new purchase accounting rules under FAS141R were effective for Micron with the beginning of our current fiscal year. Under the new rules, the net assets are recognized on the opening balance sheet at their fair values and any excess over the purchase price is recorded as a gain in the period of the acquisition. That gain in the Numonyx acquisition was $488 million, which is included in the results for the third quarter. This purchase price allocation is preliminary. While we are not aware of any adjustments to the allocation, there could be adjustments in the fourth quarter. There were no acquisition intangibles recognized in the purchase accounting, and the value of depreciating assets was just slightly lower than their historical cost reflected in the Numonyx financial statements before the acquisition. Now let us move on to a couple of other noteworthy items occurring in the quarter. During the second quarter the company accrued $64 million for estimated settlement costs for pending litigation, including the indirect purchasers’ antitrust case. Settlements to these matters are not final; however, we believe they will be finalized in the fourth quarter. Under existing supply agreements, our Lexar business periodically receives price adjustments from its suppliers of NAND products. During the third quarter, we completed a settlement that resulted in an $41 million benefit to cost of goods sold. We were successful in being awarded a total of $26 million in grants and other incentives during the third quarter. 10 million is related to our manufacturing operations, and is included as a credit to cost of goods sold, 16 million is related to our entities in China and included in the other operating income. Numonyx is a party to a joint venture with Hynix that operates a memory wafer fab in China. The arrangement with Hynix also includes a supply agreement. Hynix has certain rights that were triggered upon the change and control of Numonyx. In May, we received notification that Hynix intends to exercise their call option to purchase all of the Numonyx interest in the joint-venture, as well as notification of their intent to terminate the supply agreement. The notification from Hynix contemplates closing the purchase and termination of supply agreement in August, although the close date may occur later depending upon receipt of necessary government approvals, Micron and Hynix are currently in discussions regarding the extension of the supply agreement. The estimated price to purchase the Numonyx interest in the joint venture is approximately $425 million. ST Micro [ph] currently provides a cash guarantee in support of a $250 million bank loan to the Hynix, Numonyx joint-venture. As a result of Hynix exercise of the call option on the joint venture, we are obligated to substitute for ST Micro’s guarantee and to deposit $250 million of the proceeds from the sale into a pledged account. We will receive funds out of the pledged account as the joint-venture repays the original bank loan through 2016. Let us move on to discuss a few details of our operations during the past quarter. First, recall that several new accounting pronouncements were effective for Micron with the beginning of our 2010 fiscal year. Prior period’s results have been recast to reflect the presentation comparable with the current period. Total sales in the third quarter increased 17% over the second quarter. Compared to the third quarter of last year, total sales increased 107%, reflective of continued improvements in market condition in our business and industry over the past year, particularly for DRAM. It is important to note that in the Numonyx purchase accountings, the work in progress and finished goods inventories are written up to the estimated selling price, less estimated costs to complete. Virtually no margin will be recognized until the products on hand as of the acquisition are sold through. In addition, purchase accounting rules don’t allow the acquirer to recognize deferred revenue for products that are in the distribution channel when accounted for on a sell through basis, which is the model for both Numonyx and Micron. Until the products in the distribution channel are sold through, the only revenue reported by the Numonyx operations will be those from direct sales. Because of these items and the fact that only three weeks of Numonyx activities were included in the fiscal third quarter results, Numonyx added $80 million to consolidated net sales at a nominal gross margin. Focusing on the memory segment, that excludes any Numonyx activities, DRAM revenue increased 10% compared to the second quarter. This increase resulted primarily from a 9% increase in average selling prices. Revenue from the sales of NAND Flash products in the third quarter increased 16% compared to the previous quarter, due to a 21% increase in bit sales partially offset by a small decrease in the average selling price. Memory sales in the third quarter include royalty and technology fees of 21 million, which compares to 34 million in the previous quarter. The decrease is the result of the transition in the Nanya Technology arrangements that has shifted from a transfer fee recognized as revenue to an R&D cost sharing arrangement that is reflected as a reduction in R&D expense. Revenue from our foundry like model with Aptina was $92 million, reflecting a 15% increase compared to the second quarter. Average selling prices for DRAM products continued to strengthen in the third quarter, resulting in a 9% increase in DRAM per gigabit average selling prices compared to the second quarter, and increased 54% compared to the third quarter of last year. Sales of specialty DRAM products grew at a quicker pace in the third quarter compared to core DRAM, resulting in a slight shift of mix towards specialty DRAM products from core. This is a reversal of the trend we have seen in the past several quarters as a result of core DRAM growth from Inotera production volumes. Output from our Inotera operation decreased slightly compared to the second quarter, as Inotera continues its conversion to Micron’s stack process. Sales of DDR3 DRAM crossed over DDR2 in the third quarter to become a larger portion of the company’s sales both in bits and dollars. DRAM production costs increased slightly in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, primarily due to the increase in the cost per equivalent unit from Inotera, as a result of manufacturing inefficiencies during their transition to Micron’s stack process. Inotera continues on track though with their long-term conversion targets. DRAM cost reductions in fiscal Q4 are expected to be down low single digits and bit production is expected to be flat to up slightly compared to Q3. Micron produced product will again show cost per bit declines, while Inotera cost is expected to be relatively flat compared to Q3 as Inotera continues to incur costs related to the stack process conversion. NAND selling prices in the third quarter decreased slightly compared to the prior quarter. Total NAND bits shipped in the third quarter increased 21% compared to the second quarter as we have initiated the ramp of our 25 nm technology and transition to higher density products. NAND production cost per bit in the third quarter decrease 9% compared to the previous quarter, including the effect of the $41 million price adjustment from suppliers. NAND cost reductions in the fiscal fourth quarter are expected to be down a couple of percents, and bit production is forecast to be flat. The country is balancing the mix of products to optimize margin and to achieve cost reduction and bit growth with our ramping 25 nm technology. SG&A expenses in the third quarter were $190 million. SG&A expense in the third quarter includes expense per litigation accruals of $64 million, Numonyx SG&A costs for the period following the acquisition of $10 million, and other acquisition related costs of $14 million. R&D expense in the third quarter decreased compared to the second quarter as the 25 nm NAND process development was completed and transferred into production on our accelerated schedule. Numonyx accounted for an additional $15 million of R&D expense in the third quarter, and for the first time this quarter R&D expense includes a credit of 24 million for the cost sharing arrangement with Nanya. We anticipate SG&A expense in the fourth quarter fiscal 2010 to be between 140 and 150 million, while R&D expense in the fourth quarter is expected to be between 165 and 175 million. Both of these forecasts include Numonyx spending in Q4. Now to the balance sheet. The third quarter generated over $700 million in free cash flow to end the period with $2.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet. During the third quarter, the company generated $889 million in cash from operating activities and repaid $378 million of outstanding debt, including $218 million to the Singapore EDB, which was repaid before its maturity and $70 million for the Lexar convertible notes, which matured on April 1. Expenditure for property, plant and equipment in the third quarter were $177 million. Initial capital expenditures for our IM Flash Singapore fab are expected to begin in fiscal Q4 and increase to a significant level beginning in fiscal 2011, as we move forward with tool installations and start-up activities. With the inclusion of Numonyx capital in Q4, we expect total fiscal year 2010 CapEx to be at the high-end of our $850 million to $950 million guidance range. In Q4, we project the incremental revenue for Numonyx to be between $475 million and $500 million with gross margin in the single digits as we continue to sell inventories that were written up in purchase accounting and rebuild inventories in the distribution channel. With respect to our consolidated joint ventures, distributions were made to JV partners of $75 million in the third quarter, which consisted of distributions from IM Flash to Intel. Intel contributed $24 million to the IM Flash venture in Singapore, which matched the company’s contributions. With that I will close here and turn the commentary over to Mark Adams. Mark.
Mark Adams: Thanks Ron. We continue to see strong demand for our memory products during our third quarter. Although our Q3 has historically been slower from a demand perspective, our NAND bit shipments were up 21% and our DRAM bit shipments were up 2%. Given that our overall DRAM bit shipments increased only slightly this quarter, we consciously directed more of our bits towards higher margin products, including products to our server, networking and storage and automotive customers. Revenue from our personal computing business, which includes desktop computers, notebooks and net books, was up 3% quarter-on-quarter as ASPs remained strong in our core DRAM business. Revenue from our server business was up 22% quarter-on-quarter. Demand from our major customers continues to look robust through the second half of calendar 2010. Our networking and storage business achieved a 25% revenue increase in our third quarter. The growth in our networking and storage business was driven by a double-digit shipment increase, as well as 10% ASP increase quarter-over-quarter. As the case with our server business, the forecast from our networking and storage customers continues to be strong heading into the back half of calendar year 2010. All in all, demand for Micron’s DRAM products continues to remain very favorable as we look to optimize our production plans around these strategic growth markets, where we are uniquely positioned with a diversified product portfolio. We continue to see a shift in demand from bit shipments towards DDR3 memory in Q3. Bit shipments of DDR3 products increased as a percentage approximately mid-teens quarter-over-quarter, representing more than half of our overall core DRAM segment. When one considers our DDR2, we feel that Micron is in a favorable position to take advantage of potential increase in legacy opportunities around DDR2. From a pricing perspective, the weighted average ASPs for all of our DRAM products continued to increase, up 9% quarter-on-quarter. The ASP increase realized in Q3 were consistent across the computing, server and networking and storage segments. Contract pricing for DDR3 has remained flat quarter-to-date, even in a seasonally slow period. DDR2 spot market saw a decrease earlier in our current quarter, but has rebounded a bit since. Quarter-to-date blended DRAM ASPs are down slightly of a flat pricing. Even though the DDR3 migration is accelerating, we feel that DDR2 will be tight in supply to our existing customers within our specialty segment. I was asked about the potential of despecking memory content on our last call, and wanted to comment on what we have seen in the marketplace. In fact, we have seen limited examples of low-priced consumer PCs offering 1 and 2 gigabyte models, but by and large the OEM continue to market 4 and 8 gigabyte models. We have seen little evidence of despecking outside of the entry-level consumer market. Demand from Micron’s flat memory products continues to grow as we experienced 21% quarter-on-quarter bit shipment growth. Micron NAND products are used in a broad range of customer applications, including the consumer, mobile, and enterprise markets. We were able to advance our technology leadership in Flash memory as we began shipment of our 25 nm product through Lexar and other channel customers. We feel the 25 nm process technology will further strengthen our position in Flash memory. On the SSD front, we continue to grow shipments of our award winning C300 RealSSDs to our OEM customers, and through our crucial channel. There was substantial overlap on the SSD front with customers who rely on Micron’s DRAM solutions, thus demonstrating the overall breath and strength of our product portfolio. Our retail business had the best operating performance since the acquisition of Lexar in June of 2006. The Lexar branded flash memory card and USB products, coupled with our crucial branded SSD and DRAM model solutions have continued to gain market share worldwide. In a time of supply constraints, our retail customers value the vertical integration model Micron offers through these channels to meet their demands and requirements. We continue to see the retail and e-commerce markets for DRAM and NAND branded products as differentiated channels that few if any of our competitors are able to access directly. Trade selling pricing [ph] for NAND memory was down slightly quarter-on-quarter. This was compared to the quarter-to-date reference of flat ASPs we gave on our last call. Although there are signs of 3-bit to sell NAND from our competitors in the marketplace, we are pleased with the pricing for Micron’s 25 nm 2 bits per cell, higher performing Flash memories available to maintain a price performance benefit over other lower performance options. We feel the market will trend to higher density chips and that bit consumption will continue to grow throughout 2010. We remain optimistic that market segments such as mobile, consumer electronic devices such as tablets and the SSDs will drive demand for higher cycling performance requirements. We are pleased that the pricing has remained fairly strong during a seasonally slow season for consumer products, with trade ASPs down in just a couple of percent quarter-to-date, and we are optimistic that the NAND market will remain strong for the remainder of calendar year 2010. As Ron mentioned, due to purchase accounting rules, Numonyx numbers do not fully show up in our sales figures this quarter. I wanted to provide some commentary around the customer and market feedback. Our customers in the mobile and embedded markets are looking for Micron for grow strategically in supporting their overall memory requirements today and for their future product requirements in NOR, MCPs and NAND application. Our broad portfolio puts us in a strong position as a non-competitive supplier at our major customers. From a market perspective, NOR memory remains in very tight supply conditions and appears unlikely to change in the second half of calendar year 2010. Except for some cases where we’re holding inventory to serve some strategic customer opportunities, our finished goods inventory remains relatively low in aggregate and seasonally very low. The channel appears to be low as well. We have been asked about the impact of Europe’s economic issues on our overall business. Openly, the size of the business in some of the impacted companies is relatively small as a percentage of the overall demand, and we have not noticed any material impact to date. As we come to the end of our fiscal 2010, we are encouraged by the strong demand signals across our channel segments. Our customers continue to seek expanded supply partnerships with us as we continue to lead from a technology and portfolio scale perspective. We see the demand supply equilibrium in the memory business continuing to work in our favor as we look for continued strong operating performance going forward. With that I will hand back over to Kipp.
Kipp Bedard: Thanks Mark. We would now like to take questions from callers. (Operator instructions) With that let’s please take questions.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from Tim Luke of Barclays Capital.
Tim Luke – Barclays Capital: Thank you so much. I was wondering if you could just clarify with respect to the fiscal fourth quarter for August, what we should be thinking in terms of bit growth going forward in DRAM and in NAND, and if you could provide any framework for how we should think about beginning to model the revenue ranges for Numonyx for the coming period, and just to confirm it sounded like you were saying that as of now if pricing was stable in DRAM from now, it would be down slightly, if you could – perhaps give the same guidance with respect to the NAND environment. And then lastly, if I may, the inventory was up some, what was Numonyx in terms of the inventory change. Thank you.
Mark Adams: Thanks Tim. I think we got all those. I will take the first one. The production bit growth guidance for DRAM was flat to up slightly, and for NAND was roughly flat in our fiscal Q4 over Q3. I will hand the ball off to Ron for the Numonyx guidance.
Ron Foster: Tim, Numonyx revenue, I modeled that for you so you had a baseline to start from and going forward we don’t anticipate that we will be able to provide visibility of Numonyx separately as we get it integrated into our business unit planning and the structure of our company. But for Q4, we are anticipating for 475 million to 500 million of revenue in the fourth quarter related to new Numonyx products. And with regard to your inventory question, which I think was your fourth question, the Numonyx inventory – this was our first quarter, including the full fair value assessment. So it has no embedded margin in it as I mentioned, and so the increase in the revenue base will be at full fare value and as we flush through inventory at cost, then it will come down to a cost basis as we go through the fourth quarter. But I also anticipate that in the fourth quarter we will have very small margins on the Numonyx products, because it will be mainly flowing through at fair market value.
Tim Luke – Barclays Capital: How should we think about Numonyx margins going forward after the fourth quarter, if you could give some color there and then my last thing, I will pass it on, have you completed your arrangement with your partner for Singapore. It sounds like you have an initial matching of CapEx, but how do you see that going forward? Thank you.
Ron Foster: So, Tim, the Numonyx margin, as I mentioned the fourth quarter is going to be only slightly possible as we are flushing through fair value inventory, but beyond that time as we get to full normal cost production, I guess one thing I refer you back to is that recent reported history, they have run in the mid 20s kind of gross margin ranges.
Mark Adams: Let me jump in on IMFS if the question was relative to…
Tim Luke – Barclays Capital: Yes.
Mark Adams: Capital fund there. We still don’t have complete clarity as to the level of participation of our partner in that ramp. We have indicated previously that that fab is roughly 100,000 wafer per month fab. I think as a placeholder, you should anticipate as we move through calendar 2011,we will ramp that to roughly 60% level, but we want to maintain flexibility to move that around based on market conditions. So we don’t have a firm road map for you yet on that, and the Intel participation, again too early to say.
Tim Luke – Barclays Capital: Thank you so much guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Berenbaum of Auriga USA.
Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA: Yes, hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Can we just go back to the inventory, I'm just trying to get straight in my head there was like a $700 million increase in the quarter. How much of that was Numonyx inventory? How much of that was you marking up mark-to-market for DRAM, and then maybe just go back and relate to clarification of newer gross margin. Was newer gross margin as you reported on the P&L negative in this quarter, and then when would you expect it to get to that mid 20% normalized number?
Ron Foster: Daniel, this is Ron. So, in terms of the inventory effect in Q3, it was all driven by essentially Numonyx, and so that was the adjustment. And the inventory that we put on the balance sheet for Numonyx was at fair market value less cost to complete, so that when it goes out it will be effectively going out at a zero gross margin. So, that affect will flow through the Q3 effect, so we were essentially at zero gross margin in Q3, and will be near zero gross margin in Q4 as that continues to flow through.
Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA: So – I am sorry, so it's sort of the right way to think about it that you have $700 million in NOR revenue that has to flow through at 0% gross margin before you move to more normal gross margin?
Ron Foster: That is a reasonable way to think about it, yes.
Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA: Okay.
Ron Foster: In addition, we had – just to reiterate, we had our inventory in the distributor channel that was there at that time we executed the close, and as I mentioned in my comments, as part of the purchase accounting, the distributor inventory that was deferred on our books is wrapped up in purchase accounting and we don’t ever report that as revenue either in the current period or future. So, until that pipeline gets rebuild, the distributor inventory pipeline, we have an effect from that, and I incorporated that in the guidance for the fourth quarter that I gave you for Numonyx.
Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA: Okay, that makes sense, and then just on the accrual for litigation, what litigation are we talking about? Is this in addition to, is this cost or price fixing case and is it in addition to Rambus litigation?
Ron Foster: Dan, this is Ron again. It doesn’t relate to Rambus litigation. It is the anti-trust class-action suit related to indirect purchasers, effectively representing consumers, and that settlement involves Micron and four or five other participants in the settlement of that anti-trust class-action related to the indirect purchasers. Samsung actually previously settled that same suit and this one involves Micron, NEC, Elpda and Infineon as examples.
Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA: Thanks and then just one last administrative question, guidance for share count, share count for next quarter when you have the full effect of the Numonyx issued shares?
Ron Foster: It should be 1159.
Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA: 1159, thank you.
Ron Foster: Yes. That of course depends upon income levels.
Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA: Right, understood, but fully diluted assuming–
Ron Foster: Fully diluted will be at 1160.
Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA: Great. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kate Kotlarsky of Goldman Sachs.
Kate Kotlarsky - Goldman Sachs: Hi, thank you for taking my question. A couple of questions, first on the NAND bit shipment guidance for next quarter, could you maybe clarify a little bit as to why we're only seeing flat production next quarter, and if there is any difference between what you expect your production to be next quarter versus what you expect your shipments to be?
Mark Durcan: Yes. This is Mark Durcan. Let me jump on that one. The effects were numerous, but primarily revolve around increased penetration of our 25 nm node being offset by lower volume purchases, but primarily a shift in mix to more higher margin NAND products, which tend to be lower densities.
Kate Kotlarsky - Goldman Sachs: Okay, that makes sense, and then any difference in what your production is going to be versus the actual shipments in the quarter?
Mark Durcan: I believe we are roughly flat. No inventory change.
Kate Kotlarsky - Goldman Sachs: Okay, and then my other question is on the cost reduction trajectory, you mentioned that next quarter cost reductions will be fairly minimal, should we expect them to accelerate over the next couple of quarters and if you can quantify that that would be great?
Mark Durcan: Yes, absolutely. We have got a lot of runway ahead of us here as we move into fiscal 2011. In particular on the Inotera front, we have the 50 nm transition moving ahead, and we will really start to see the impact of that, and fiscal Q1 and beyond should be a big story for the entire year. On the NAND front, I mentioned we were into the 25 nm transition, that will be on the order of 25% of the bits in the quarter we are in and it will be closer to 75% of the bits the following quarter, and that will drive significant cost reductions as we move through the year on the NAND front as well. So to boil all that down, I think on the NAND front, you can look for high teens moving forward quarter-over-quarter and for DRAM, you can be a little bit lumpy, but averaging out something in the mid-teens.
Kate Kotlarsky - Goldman Sachs: Okay, and then just finally, the follow-up to my first question on the NAND side, how should we think about the growth after Q4?
Mark Durcan: Sorry, can you say that again Kate?
Kate Kotlarsky - Goldman Sachs: Yes, so next quarter, on the NAND side, bit production is going to be relatively flat. How should we think about that in the following quarters?
Mark Durcan: Yes, bit production, probably flattish again the following quarter, and then we will have some pretty good growth after that. I would say, how would we characterize that guys? Yes, mid-teens.
Kate Kotlarsky - Goldman Sachs: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Wong of Wells Fargo.
David Wong - Wells Fargo: Thanks very much. Can you give us a rough idea of what your weeks of inventory are for DRAM and NAND, and do I understand correctly if you got about $700 million on Numonyx revenue and you're saying that the run rate might be $500 million that accounts to about 20 weeks of inventory for the Numonyx NOR stuff?
Mark Adams: I will take a short on the inventory question, on our finished goods inventory, we are slightly below. Our normal inventory level is about three weeks on hand for finished goods, and in certain high-volume products they are even less than that. Sometimes, towards the end of the quarter, we have the choice to make on holding over some inventory to position and serve some higher margin opportunities in some of the specialty areas we serve, and that sometimes is the case. But on average, we are lower than we are normally seasonally, and slightly less than three weeks in total.
Ron Foster: This is Ron. In terms of your Numonyx revenue question, I didn’t say $700 million Numonyx revenue, we had about $700 million, $686 million in Numonyx inventory at the end of the quarter, and that was mostly marked to fair market value of the acquisition, although we did have obviously production that went in there in the three week intervening period after the close. Then that will flow through essentially at market value less cost to complete. It will flow through and based upon the guidance, the vast majority will flow through in the fiscal fourth-quarter, but bear in mind some of that inventory already is probably at cost in that mix also.
David Wong - Wells Fargo: But doesn't that mean that you've got a quarter or more less of inventory on your balance sheet for the NOR?
Ron Foster: That is correct. Yes.
David Wong - Wells Fargo: Great, thanks.
Ron Foster: Yes, that is right.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Gauna, I am sorry if I mispronounced your name from JMP Securities.
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities: Yes, thanks very much. I was wondering and I apologize because I think you've touched on this, but with your flat bit or flattish to slightly up bit growth in DRAM, can you reconcile what I would think would be stronger seasonality on that front with that sort of guidance?
Ron Foster: Keep in mind that is not a shipments guidance that is only production guidance.
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities: Okay, and so but again, in such tight environment wouldn't we be looking to grow it? I mean, is it entirely accounted for by the transitions going on with Inotera and DDR2 to DDR3 conversion?
Mark Durcan: Yes, our bit growth is right now no wafers coming on board for us in the immediate future. So it is all transitions. So it is a combination of Inotera transition and Micron’s internal or wholly owned transition.
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities: Okay, and then if I could ask the same question that you just answered on NAND, if we looked beyond this current quarter, what might we see on the DRAM bit growth side a little bit later in the year?
Mark Durcan: Yes, after Q4 you should start looking for some double-digit bit increases on the production side.
Alex Gauna - JMP Securities: All right, thanks very much.
Mark Durcan: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Glen Yeung of Citi.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup: Hi, you mentioned that there was some difficulties with the conversion to stack at Inotera, and the long term targets remain the same. Have there been any changes, can you talk about some of the changes to the more near term targets?
Mark Durcan: Yes, this is Mark Durcan. I wouldn’t say that there is anything really unexpected going on with Inotera. We have just continued to move through equipment installations and deploying the technology on what has been the tool set of Micron as well as some repurpose tools there. In the short term, we will see a slight reduction in the wafer start rate, as we just work through the equipment repurposing activities, but we still anticipate being on the original schedule as we move late into the calendar year, and that driving some pretty significant bit growth for us throughout 2011.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup: Okay, and are you planning specialty DRAM mix to remain at the higher levels for the rest of the second half of calendar 2010?
Mark Adams: Yes, this is Mark Adams. That was something I alluded to in my opening comments and that given the profile we are looking, we were able to this quarter shift towards some specialty and higher margin segment for ourselves. And we do see some upside there, as we are in some cases sole sourced in some of these applications, and certainly tied to some of the growth opportunities in the market.
Kipp Bedard: And the next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Amir of Lazard Capital Markets.
Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets: Thanks a lot. All my questions have been answered but can you give maybe some commentary on kind of what you're seeing a bit in terms of customers in the PC space and how or where we're standing in terms of back-to-school orders right now?
Mark Adams: Yes, thanks Dan. It is Mark again. So, we saw kind of analysts and press talking about a softer April, but openly since kind of the May timeframe, we started to see some pretty healthy indications on the back-to-school in the second half of the year. Notably, the server business has been very strong, the desktop business is very strong, and the June OEM numbers around notebooks is very strong. So, despite some concerns or questions early on in our quarter back in April, it has still been fairly strong. We feel pretty good about it.
Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets: And in terms of the specialty DRAM market?
Mark Adams: You know, likewise, as I said, we had the opportunity to take a look at our allocation models given some of the limited production upside we had this quarter, and we shipped as much as we could to those markets, because there is a lot of appetite our products. I would also mention, there is a number of questions on the Numonyx side on today’s call, and it is not just pertaining to DRAM and Flash memory, the NOR specialty market is a high-growth opportunity for us as this tremendous appropriate for Numonyx parts in that channel is low.
Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets: Okay, thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Hsueh of Oppenheimer & Co.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Co: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just a few more follow-up questions to some of the questions that have already been asked, but just curious here in terms of your ability to basically change production bits from commodity to specialty, was that more of a reaction to what you're seeing in the marketplace particularly vis-a-vis a little bit of incremental weakness here on the commodity side with the PC market. And second question just similar vein, you talked about decontenting, you came out and said basically you didn't see any evidence of that. I was wondering how much visibility do you have on particular specs for PCs for the back-to-school selling season, in other words, are you seeing any kind of visibility or do you have any visibility on DRAM content per box in Q3 and Q4, and I have a few more follow-ups.
Mark Adams: Yes, I think the first question is did we – I think, let me restate this. Did we move some capacity, did we move it to more profitable products because we foresee weakness in the less profitable segments, not as much. We were just trying to optimize profits. On the second question around going forward configurations, we are not as tied to the choices that our OEMs make on individual configurations. I will tell you that part of my our responsibility is around the retail business, and I got pretty good interactions with the retailers and e-tailers. So far the consumers haven’t voted on going down the lower configurations. You’ve got to remember the emotional part of buying here, the emotional part of buying is when you are used to going out and evaluating and purchasing 4 gigabyte platforms. Behaviorally, it doesn’t just seem right to go down in 1 to 2 gigabyte products, and that is just a consumer sentiment. Secondly, these especially never hit the corporate PC side. So, it is such a small piece day, and haven’t proven to be successful that I would be surprised if it made an impact in the back half of the year.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Co: Okay, great and just a follow-up in terms of manufacturing. You guided to single bit production on DRAM particularly. I thought that, correct me if I'm wrong, that crossover in terms of wafer production that Inotera pushed back had occurred or is expected to occur at the end of Q2, just wondering is there any kind of set back in terms of the ramp here going on at Inotera for stack particularly in regards to your single digit kind of production guidance for fiscal Q4 and how much more acceleration could we see now in the November and February quarters?
Mark Durcan: Yes, I think – this is Mark, relative to Inotera, I think your assumptions relative to the original plan was off a little bit. We are as I said continuing the pace. We are probably lagging a couple of months at the current point, but we anticipate that as we move through Q4 that will be right back on track. So we don’t see any long-term disruption there.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Co: Okay, and we could expect basically double digit big growth beyond Q4 for DRAM?
Mark Durcan: Mid-teens, I think yes.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Co: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Uche Orji of UBS.
Uche Orji - UBS: Thank you very much. Just a couple of questions, one is any idea how much DDR3 will constitute of your sub 50-nanometer products in the second half of 2010? Just trying to get a sense of I know you've cost on DDR3 but I just want to know how much that kind of constitutes of your sub 50-nanometer products.
Mark Durcan: Let me take a shot of that. This is Mark again.
Uche Orji - UBS: Hi Mark.
Mark Durcan: I think the – for 50-nanometer in the quarter we are currently in it’s probably, it’s roughly two to one DDR3 to DDR2.
Uche Orji - UBS: Okay. All right. That's helpful. So let me just ask you, you're saying your inventory is about three weeks. Any insight as to what the inventory at the OEMs or the channel at the major companies is at the moment? Because usually, (inaudible) back-to-school some people tend to with past school inventories, any commentary as to what the channel inventory is would be helpful.
Mark Adams: Yes, thanks. This is Mark Adams again. So the inventory, it’s actually interesting, is much tighter than you expect OEM to back-to-school. My suspicion is you know that I think we all have to remember, we’re not sitting here in the most robust economy. It serves better than 2009, but people still have kind of the memory of running to the working capital strains of that time period, and they’re pretty efficient on supply-chain and probably a little bit more risk averse than they were a year, two years back. So we see pretty tight inventories across the channels and even back into the ODM that you referred to earlier, and don’t see a lot of buildup at this point.
Uche Orji - UBS: Okay, let me ask you about the – because you talk about networking and storage business, and that's of course your specialty business. How much of – in terms of the demand you are seeing there, how much more runway do you expect for strength in the demand there, and while you – in answering that also, any commentary you can make as to the configuration you have seen in the server market and to what extent that reflects the overall strength in our enterprise vending, that would be helpful, thank you.
Mark Adams: Yes, a more qualitative response to that question is you know, it’s hard to see far-off behind you know, 6 to 12 months from a demand cycle, but it looks good, it looks really strong. The networking guys obviously are looking to get in the computing and vice versa. So you see a lot more technology players around storage, not just on the DRAM side they were talking to us about Flash applications and certainly NOR application. So as best we can see that that’s a very healthy segment for us, and one where we are pretty well positioned from a product portfolio standpoint.
Uche Orji - UBS: All right. And my last question is regarding Europe. I mean, this has been a topic for everybody in terms of you got some OEMs talking about raising prices for PC products in Europe. In the last week you kind of responded to the currency weakness. In the demand you're seeing out of Europe has there been any change at all, be it by overall specifications or people pushing back in terms of pricing on the component level, so any comments on Europe would be helpful. Thank you very much. That's my last question.
Mark Adams: Sure. You know, we haven’t seen and ironically what led to my comments earlier was we’ve actually seen some pockets of strength in retail in Europe. Certainly there has been some questions about Greece and others, smaller markets but on the margin it has been okay, and so we haven’t seen the dramatic shift. You know, a lot of conversations about it, but we haven’t seen a dramatic shift, and certainly some of the currency indications abound, but the other side of that equation is China retail has been up dramatically. So on a global footprint you know, whatever noise there might be in some smaller regions in Europe is more than offset by some other global success path around china, India and others.
Uche Orji - UBS: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Cassidy of Thomas Weisel Partners.
Kevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel Partners: Thanks for taking my questions. Were there any changes in your gross margin rankings of your different product groups?
Mark Durcan: I will rank them if you like?
Kevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel Partners: Sure.
Mark Durcan: Specialty DRAM continued to lead, number two was our trade NAND, number three was core DRAM, number four was the segment we now have as imaging and other, and then of course Numonyx was number five.
Kevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay, thanks for that, and for your internal DRAM conversion, is there any change to that schedule or could you remind us what the schedule is?
Mark Durcan: No, Kevin, I think over the long-haul we get through Q4 and we’re looking for a pretty big fiscal 2011. It’ll, you know, be in the mid teens and accelerate. In the short term we’re maybe lagging a couple of months at Inotera, but that will play through here relatively quickly.
Kevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay, and one last question on Numonyx. Of the $80 million that you sold to OEMs, what exposure was that split between handsets and embedded customers?
Mark Durcan: I think – correct me if I’m wrong here. The $80 million wasn’t maybe the actual revenue. It was the revenue we recognized by virtue of the accounting treatment of the quarter, and how did we close on the debt. So that notwithstanding, I think the answer you’re looking for is about 65% to 70% wireless and about 30 plus percent around the embedded market.
Kevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bob Gujavarty of Deutsche Bank.
Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank: Great, thanks for taking my question. I thought you guys were a little bit constrained on your server shipments because of the Inotera transition. So I was a bit surprised how strong server was. Do you think server can be strong again in the coming quarter despite some slower bit growth than you'd hoped for perhaps from Inotera?
Mark Adams: Yes, this is Mark Adams again. Yes, absolutely and yes I think your comment is well founded. It’s coming out of last quarter and as I mentioned on this quarter’s call and a couple of other calls in the past, sometimes we make the choice to hold on to certain inventory products that can go into those markets, and if it happens to be over a quarter and we hold it for two weeks after the closing of the quarter, we do so for the profit and customer service rationale. So we’re in pretty good shape right now and we expect as we go through the conversions at Inotera to our stack technology that will again allow us to penetrate and grow our service here.
Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank: Great, thanks and just a quick follow-up on NAND. You alluded to this a little bit, but can you kind of estimate what kind of price premium you're getting for your 34-nanometer NAND? It seems like it is and your 25-nanometer NAND, if you have seen any – were you able to maintain your price premium going to the new technology because of your performance advantage?
Mark Adams: I think that it’s a little bit early to tell, but we feel pretty confident on the 25-nanometer ASPs. We’re just getting that into some of the OEM design and qualification efforts. On the 34-nanometer what we really are seeing is kind of a bifurcation between higher performing, higher cycling products, 2-bit-per-cell MLC, and some of the low performing 3-bit-per-cell application for emerging markets consumer products that are acceptable for certain regions, and we’re seeing kind of two different price points. We have been able to hold pricing pretty favorably against that in our current contract OEM customers.
Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vipon Nyag [ph] of Macquarie Capital.
Vipon Nyag - Macquarie Capital: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just had a quick question about the DRAM and NAND production bits for the current quarter. Could you give us an idea what those were?
Ron Foster: They were up a couple of percent.
Vipon Nyag - Macquarie Capital: For both DRAM and NAND?
Ron Foster: Oh sorry. That was for NAND. I think excuse me that was DRAM, and for NAND it was actually up very nice little more than we even guided, which as you recall was high teens.
Vipon Nyag - Macquarie Capital: Okay, great, thanks, and also if pricing would have stayed flat at current levels, how do you see ASPs coming out at the end of the quarter, Q4?
Mark Adams: If pricing were to stay at the level we are in, how do we see them? DRAM relatively stable, relatively flat through the remainder of the quarter, and, you know, NAND is interesting because we’re going into a stronger period of NAND historically and so it’s coming out of the June, July seasonally slow period and heading into back-to-school, but if it stayed relatively flat, down slightly a point or two.
Vipon Nyag - Macquarie Capital: Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Dezellem of Tieton Capital Management.
Bill Dezellem - Tieton Capital Management: Yes, thank you. A couple of questions for you, first of all relative to the termination of the JV with Hynix, does that imply that the $250 million or so you said was in escrow through what was it 2016 or so, that would then come out of that account and be back on your balance sheet or I guess either way, but available to you?
Ron Foster: Bill, this is Ron. The JV agreement and the call option would specify that we put $250 million essentially a pledge escrow account, if you will, and it would be paid down by the joint venture between now and 2016 as – over that time schedule. So the flow of the cash back to us would be over that period between now and 2016.
Bill Dezellem - Tieton Capital Management: Okay, thank you, and then the supply agreement that you're looking to renegotiate with Hynix or that Numonyx is looking to renegotiate with Hynix, would you please discuss the implications positive and negative that could develop around that negotiation?
Ron Foster: We’re in the midst of discussions Bill and it is not appropriate to talk at this time, but suffice to say that Micron is intent on continuing the supply to our customers and will certainly supply it, and we will be working with our JV partner to affect that transition and supporting our customers over time.
Bill Dezellem - Tieton Capital Management: Thank you, and then my final question is that during the course of this call there was a reference to Numonyx and growth opportunities that you're seeing within various Numonyx markets. And given that there's been a fair amount of discussion about Numonyx markets being mature or even declining, would you please discuss in more detail the growth opportunities that you are seeing and what those of us on the outside that have been thinking about declining or missing?
Mark Adams: Yes, I think you characterize the overall NOR growth fairly. I would suggest that maybe the industry structure and the dynamics that have played out over the last 12 to 18 months come into play when you think about other competitive issues around last year, and reliability of the Micron now enables Numonyx has a strong balance sheet well financed product diverse company, and if you look at the embedded market as an example, the forecast growth in that market alone allows us to go in and get more share and it is a place that Numonyx has historically been very strong in. So certainly in a macro level I get the understanding what you’re suggesting about NOR, from a work perspective that’s modest, but the competitive landscape as well as the embedded market by itself represents some tremendous growth opportunity and that historically has been a higher margin segment for Numonyx.
Bill Dezellem - Tieton Capital Management: So when you net those two together, how would you view the overall Numonyx market space?
Mark Adams: I view for Micron very positively.
Bill Dezellem - Tieton Capital Management: Thank you both.
Kipp Bedard: Thanks Bill, and I apologize for those who are left in the queue but we’ve run out of time today. So I’d like to thank everyone for participating on the call.

And now I’d like to turn the call over to Mr. Ron Foster. Ron?
Ron Foster: Thanks, Kipp. Our press release is available on our website. Let me start off with a brief summary of the financial results of the second quarter of fiscal 2010, which ended March 4, 2010. The company reported net income of $365 million or $0.39 per diluted share on net sales of just under $2 billion. Again, each of our convertible notes are included in the diluted share count using the if-converted method, as they are each diluted at the current level of income. Combined with our first quarter, year-to-date net income is $569 million or $0.61 per diluted share on net sales of $3.7 billion. You may note from the financial summary on the slide that both our aggregate equity method investees, primarily Inotera, and our consolidated ventures, principally TECH Semiconductor, were profitable in the second quarter as a result of generally improved market conditions. In the second quarter, we entered to a new solar joint venture where we own a 50% interest in the development stage company. Our initial non-cash contribution consisted of manufacturing facilities and equipment, intellectual property, and a fully paid lease for Fab 1A at our Boise site. No gain or loss is recognized on the contribution, as our initial contribution was valued at $65 million, which was equal to the carrying value of the assets. We will account for our interest in the venture using the equity method of accounting. Recall that several new accounting announcements were effected from Micron at the beginning of our 2010 fiscal year. Prior periods’ results and presentation have been recast to reflect the presentation comparable with the current period. Now let’s move on to discuss other specifics for the quarter. Total sales in the second quarter increased 13% over the first quarter. Compared to the same quarter of last year, total sales increased 97%, reflective of recent improvements in market condition, in our business and industry, most significantly for DRAM products. Our joint venture relationships, particularly with Inotera and IM Flash, are improving our leverage to take advantage of this upturn. DRAM revenue increased 24% compared to the first quarter. This increase resulted primarily from a higher volume of sales, of gigabit density DDR3 products on advanced process technologies and from a higher volume of sales of DDR2 products from our Inotera venture. Revenue from sales of NAND Flash products in the second quarter was roughly stable compared to the previous quarter, yet we are 32% higher compared to the same quarter of the previous year. This increase was primarily due to increased bit production of products on our 34 nanometer process technology. Memory sales in the second quarter include royalties and technology fees of $34 million, which is roughly flat compared to the previous quarter. The total DRAM average selling price increased 7% in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, while total bit shipments increased 17%. The selling price increase is a product of a 10% increase in selling prices for core DRAM products and a 13% increase in prices for specialty DRAM products. These increases were partially offset by the continued mix shift toward core products from the relatively higher priced specialty DRAM products. The greater mix of core DRAM products comes mainly from production of higher density DDR3 products and from increased volumes from Inotera. DRAM production cost per bit, excluding the effects of the lower cost of market write-downs, decreased 7% compared to the first quarter. Micron’s cost per product supplied by Inotera is determined using a margin sharing model where increasing market selling prices achieved by Micron increases Micron’s cost of product from the joint venture. Consequently, cost per bit increased on Inotera volumes purchased in the quarter while cost per bit on Micron produced volume declined greater than the 7% average. Micron’s participation in Inotera’s net earnings is included on our income statement on the line Income from Equity Method Investees. DRAM cost reductions and bit production in fiscal Q3 are both expected to be relatively flat compared to Q2. Micron produced products will again show cost per bit declines, while Inotera cost is expected to be flat to up, as it varies partially based on market price trends. In addition, Micron is incurring additional cost per bit from Inotera, as it prepares for qualification and initial production ramp of Micron’s 50-nanometer stack product, which will begin in the third quarter. Both total NAND and trade NAND selling prices decreased slightly in the second quarter compared to the first. Total NAND bits shipped in the second quarter was flat compared to Q1 in part from fewer NAND purchases from third-party suppliers in support of our retail channel. NAND production cost per bit in the second quarter decreased 6% compared to the previous quarter. NAND bit cost reductions in the fiscal third quarter are expected to be in the high-single digit range and bit production is forecast to be up mid-to-high teens. SG&A and R&D expenses for the second quarter came in at 5% and 7.5% of revenue respectively. SG&A expense in the second quarter includes costs associated with our pending acquisition of Numonyx. As a result of recently effective account rules, it requires such cost to be expensed in the period incurred as opposed to the old rule where they were capitalized as a part of the purchase price. R&D expense in the second quarter includes a higher level of development costs for our 25-nanometer NAND process. As we have accelerated the introduction of this industry-leading technology, which is nearing its initial production ramp. We anticipate SG&A expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 to be between $95 million to $105 million and R&D expenses to be in the $140 million to $150 million range. Other operating income in the second quarter includes a credit of $11 million in receipts from the US government in connection with anti-dumping tariffs collected from certain of our competitors. Now, the balance sheet. The second quarter generated over $600 million in free cash flow to end the period with $1.9 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Our strong operational performance in the second quarter generated $804 million in cash from operating activities. Expenditure of property, plant and equipment in the second quarter was $180 million. Our IM Flash Singapore fab is moving forward with startup activities, including placing purchase orders and preparing the facility for tool installations, most of which will commence in fiscal 2011. You may recall from prior disclosures that $70 million of the convertible notes mature on April 1, 2010. These notes have a conversion price of $11.28 per share. These are convertible notes we acquired with the Lexar purchase. During our second quarter, Inotera sold equity securities to its partners and the public, in which Micron invested $138 million. Micron’s total ownership interest remained approximately the same at 30%. With this additional capital and their planned debt offerings, we believe Inotera has the capital necessary to fully execute the conversion to Micron’s stack process technology. With respect to our consolidated joint ventures, distributions were made to JV partners of $84 million in the second quarter, which consisted of distributions from IM Flash to Intel, our partner. With that, I’ll close here and turn the commentary over to Mark Adams.
Mark Adams: Thanks, Ron. Demand for Micron’s memory products remained strong across nearly all of our customer segments in our second quarter. DRAM bit shipments were up 17% quarter-over-quarter and our NAND trade bit shipments were up 5% over our first quarter. The latter illustrates the strength in the NAND market where we have historically experienced a seasonally slower demand cycle during this time of the year. Revenue from our personal computing business, which includes desktop computers, notebooks and netbooks, was up 34% quarter-on-quarter due to a strong ASP environment and an increase in bit shipments. Quarter PC demand has gained strength in calendar Q1, which when combined with continued solid growth numbers around our retail, just the PC business looks pretty healthy in 2010. Our core DRAM market, revenue from our server business was up 22% quarter-on-quarter. Bit forecast from our server customers have ranged between 80% to 100% growth year-over-year. Our networking and storage business achieved a 24% revenue increase in our second quarter. This was primarily due to a quarterly increase in ASP for (inaudible) 20% reflecting continued strength in our specialty products as well. Demand from our networking customer base has strengthened, as infrastructure investments continued to drive the need for equipment purchases. All in all, demand for Micron DRAM product remained robust as we remain challenge to support our strategic customers growing demand. We continued to see a shift in demand in bit shipments toward DDR3 memory in Q2. Bit shipments of DDR3 product increased approximately 28% quarter-over-quarter. It is worth noting that this growth has after the previous two quarters posted 40% and 50% quarterly increases respectively. Even when considering the increased DDR2 offer from our Inotera relationship, our DDR3 product mix increased from 40% to 45% of our total core DRAM revenue in Q2. Despite this market transition to DDR3, DDR2 bit shipments also increased up 11%. In terms of the Inotera output with Micron’s 200 million capacity that primarily supports our specialty products, we feel Micron is in a unique position to take advantage of our strong opportunities in both the core and specialty DDR2 markets going forward. From a pricing perspective, the weighted average ASP for all of our DRAM products were up 7% quarter-over-quarter. We are seeing sustained strong demand for our products and price increasing so far quarter-to-date versus the weighted average ASP in Q2. DDR3 price remained solid throughout Q2, and we are encouraged with the continuing strength in our DDR2 ASPs as well. DDR2 spot market pricing went dramatically from late January on 1 gigabit equipment component. In fact, the recent spot market pricing is showing that DDR2 has basically reached ASP parity for light density with DDR3 at this point (inaudible). In total, our aggregate DRAM ASPs are up mid-single digits quarter-to-date from our Q2 average. And occasionally from our OEM contract price negotiation for April, that prices will remain trending higher. Demand for Micron’s Flash memory products remained unchallenged and continued to be strong throughout our second quarter as well. We continue to ship primarily all of our NAND products based on our industry-leading 34-nanometer technology. In addition, we’ve begun the qualification process with major OEMs in our Lexar business on our recently announced 25-nanometer Flash memory technology. We anticipate first customer ship to be later in this current quarter. We feel the 25-nanometer flash technology will further strengthen our cost leadership position in Flash memory. On the SSD front, we began shipping our award winning C300 RealSSD beyond our OEM customer base into our distribution channel during the second quarter. Initial demand for SSD product is very strong, and we are currently on allocation for our channel customers and we sold out on our crucial.com and it is first we are being offered online. Our retail business had an outstanding second quarter. The Lexar brand and Flash memory chart and USB products coupled with our Crucial branded SSD and DRAM module solutions have continued to capture impressive share gain globally. At a time of tight supply in both DRAM and NAND, our retail customers increasingly realized the value that Lexar and Crucial offer as a vertically integrated supplier to their critical demand requirements. Given the price stability in NAND end markets, our retail channel continue to positively contribute to Micron’s operating performance. Trade selling prices for NAND memory was relatively flat quarter-on-quarter. This was compared to the quarter-to-date reference of down 10% we gave on our last call. Due to seasonality, one might have expected potential for total to softening in the NAND market. This clearly did not materialize, and NAND quarter-to-date pricing has remained stable. While there are signs of 3-bit to sell NAND for (inaudible) in the market, we are pleased that pricing for Micron 34-nanometer 2 bits per cell, high performing Flash memory available to maintain the premium in the markets we serve. We feel the market will trend to higher density (inaudible) and the bit consumption will continue to grow throughout 2010. We remain optimistic about market segments such as mobile, consumer electronic devices such as electronic readers and SSDs will continue to drive demand and that the NAND market will remain in the favorable condition in the course of 2010. As we entered the second half of our fiscal year, we are encouraged by the strong demand signals across most of our channel segments. Inventories are high, the distribution channels remained lean, and we have no reason to believe that this will change in the foreseeable future. We remain challenged to meet the upside forecast from our major OEMs in both DRAM and NAND, and that will continue to focus on driving our available capacity to customers that deliver the most business value for Micron. With that, I’ll hand it back over to Kipp.
Kipp Bedard: Thanks, Mark. And now we’d like to take questions from callers. Just a reminder, if you are using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset when asking the questions so we can hear you clearly. With that, please open the question lines.
Operator: Thank you, sir. (Operator instructions) Our first question in queue comes from James Covello with Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.
James Covello – Goldman Sachs: Great. Thanks so much, guys. Appreciate it. Congratulations. Couple things. I guess maybe the first thing relative to the discipline that we’ve seen so far this cycle in the memory space, which has led to this very, very healthy supply/demand dynamic, one of the things I think you guys have been rightly focused on has been the second and third tier DRAM players didn’t have the capital to invest. How do you think about that dynamic changing as the cash flow for the industry improves and there is a little bit more capital availability? No, not everybody is going to have the cash flow that you guys generated. But relatively speaking, better cash flow across the industry.
Ron Foster: Hey, Jim. It’s obviously a little hard to predict what they will do, but when we do our own competitive analysis, we – in answer to that question, we primarily I think focused on the debt structures. And if you look at cash to short-term debt, at least to what’s in the balance sheet right now, I think you will find that (inaudible) in all different categories so they don’t break it out in front of us to measure. But we feel fine that Micron (inaudible) has all other colors out for sale with cash on the book right now where it kind of (inaudible) in the next 12 months. The other guys all have challenges around that. So I think it’s true that – the two things I think, Jim, you ought to consider when you think about how this plays out. One is they have pretty big debt structures to deal with as a result of what’s happened over the last two, three years. And then secondly, when you think about where most of them are under technology migration, in particular the ones that have several more significant debt structures relative to their capital size, have some pretty big challenges in terms of migration in terms of technology node. So I still find it interesting that I made this comment on the last conference call that we had, earnings call that we had that it still remains the fact that there is no new memory fab under construction right now anywhere in the world. And that is the first time that’s ever occurred in my lifetime in this industry, and it’s still that way obviously several months later. So when you think about what can happen moving forward, clearly as you get into probably later 2011, 2012, it’s a little early to tell and it’s hard to predict what will happen with capital deployment. But from everything that we see right now, there are a lot bigger issues facing those companies and simply building new fabs. And it’s both the requirement that the – first and foremost, you will see companies try to advance their technology if they can do it beyond what they have to do in terms of debt repayment. So I don’t think there is anything in the near-term, Jim, that’s going to change that equation.
James Covello – Goldman Sachs: Very helpful. Thank you. And if I could just ask one follow-up, I know there has been some concern from folks with maybe some of the second and third tier OEMs about de-specking DRAM, given the acceleration in pricing. I wouldn’t imagine that’s much of a problem with the larger OEMs. But anything you’ve seen there or any just broader comments on kind of outlook on content box. Thanks again so much. Congratulations.
Mark Adams: Hey, Jim, this is Mark. We haven’t seen though, are we getting forecasted along with that. We kind of hear from the press and analysts that there might be that potential that we have not seen it. And I’ll tell you what; it’s using to take it off a lot of that to swing back into a supply problem.
James Covello – Goldman Sachs: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our next question in queue comes from Glen Yeung with Citi. Your question, please.
Glen Yeung – Citi: Actually just to ask a clarification on that last question, which is – as opposed to de-specking per se, what’s your sense on the rate of bit per box growth in 2010? Any sense that they may be different than your original expectations a quarter ago?
Mark Adams: So as we’re sitting today, if we look back about a year ago that you were asking the same question, everything is going to [ph] go only higher. It’s going to peak out about 2.5 gigabytes per system. It looks like it’s going to be about 30% more or less. Right now, it’s in the mid-threes. So – and you can – if you look at kind of just pick up a Sunday paper and you look at the inserts, there is a lot more fours and eights than they used to be. And so I think constant to our opinion a year ago what might be in front of us is actually the reverse of what is being projected and that’s the only thing that’s changing now today.
Glen Yeung – Citi: Okay. Just a couple other questions. One is, what your sense is on inventory? Few of the OEMs have talked about strategic inventory builds, and I wonder if that’s something that you sensed out there. And my other question is just any update you have on the Numonyx deal.
Ron Foster: Well, I’ll take the first piece, the inventory piece. We are not seeing any of that, and a lot of that has to do with just meeting the current demand in the market today. I stretch my head when I get asked that question given that people would have to believe one thing that pricing is going up to accumulate and enjoy today if they think it’s going to be higher in the future. And we’re – it's so tight right now that it’s hard to believe anyone has got a lot of extra inventory to ship in that dynamic.
Mark Adams: On Numonyx front, it’s doing pretty well. We are clearly working through integration plans and preparing for a close. We’ve received regulatory approval in a number of countries and we are still, we think, on target – the last time we said, I think, somewhere in the next 90 to 180 days, and from when we signed, which was in February, and we are still on that track. So we feel pretty good about it. And I would just add that the more that we interact with a company, I think the more excited we are about their technology and their products.
Glen Yeung – Citi: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question in queue comes from Gary Hsueh with Oppenheimer. Your question, please.
Venkaiah Phulkari – Oppenheimer: Hi, this is Venkaiah Phulkari [ph]. Couple of questions. Regarding – the DRAM price is moving up pretty fast. And do you see this is driven by the current demand in the PC space or is it driven by the PC OEMs worry about future supply constraints so they are building up inventories? As a related question, what’s your current view on the magnitude of inventories that the OEMs have right now?
Ron Foster: To restate what I early said, I don’t think there is an inventory build going on. It’s funny, if you look at some of the recent data about retail PC growth year-over-year, it’s pretty significant. Even if you look at the last three months reported somewhere in the 33% all the way as high as 50% to 57% in December and 27% in January, these are pretty big numbers in the demand side. And then you add in the corporate growth and starting to get invest it back in the PC upgrade model. We don’t think there is a lot of inventory build, to be honest with you. We think it’s pretty healthy demand. And again, I guess one could argue that February and March are typically not great demand seasons. I think we are in exception period around this industry [ph].
Venkaiah Phulkari – Oppenheimer: That’s pretty helpful. Just a follow-up on your Singapore fab, giving US not ramping towards the end of the year, could you provide some color on how do you finance your CapEx for the next year’s ramp? And also for that new fab, are you reconsidering the Intel share for that new fab? Are you thinking about buying back some of the Intel ownership operating effect?
Steve Appleton: This is Steve. With respect to the Intel partnership, we like the partnership. It’s gone well. We’ve continued to co-invest. Whether or not they decide to co-invest in future projects, I get to – you will have to ask Intel. We will make the assumption that our partners will inform. We’re going to keep moving that business forward. You asked a question related to that. What about the financing? What we would do in terms of the mixed signal for fabs and NAND? I will tell you, if you do the math and you look at the result of the company right now, we don’t see any issue with respect to being able to finance that CapEx. I think if your question is trying to get at, do we see a need to go to the markets here any time soon, the answer is no, we don’t. We have great cash flow. And right now, it looks pretty good for our ability to just to deal with it internally.
Venkaiah Phulkari – Oppenheimer: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question in queue comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your question, please.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse: Yes, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Mark, you talked about the server business being up about 25% sequentially, and I guess for the second quarter where it’s been up that strong, but still not as strong as the overall PC business. I guess, we on the investment community been focused on what’s turning up to be a pretty strong server cycle. Given that DRAM bits aren’t really growing all that much in the fiscal third quarter, how should we think about your guys ability to manage mix to maybe higher ASP, higher margin DRAM after the current fiscal quarter?
Mark Adams: I think one of the limiters to that has been the Inotera conversion to our stack technology, which will open up some more capacity to serve the server business. Our growth there is limited on available performing parts for that phase. And it still ramp up what I would say is our annual plan in the segment, halfway through the year. It’s just – the big growth in servers is staggering really. And so as we get to the Inotera conversion of the stack technology, we will have more server to out of the yields to not be able to increase our top-line revenue and growth in bit shipments and with segments.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse: So calendar year third quarter is the quarter we could actually see a positive mix shift on the DRAM business?
Mark Adams: Yes, I believe so.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse: And then just an update on CapEx for this fiscal year and maybe some guidance for next?
Ron Foster: This is Ron. I have previously communicated 850 to 950 for the year on CapEx for fiscal year ’10 and we are still on that plat of half the IMFS plan that’s going to have some amount of facilitization capital invested at the end of the fiscal year. That was contemplated in that guidance number. In terms of next year’s CapEx guidance, we are still working on the plan of the ramp of IMFS and is that timing and rate of that ramp. So don’t have an update for FY ’11. In general, it’s – I expect to be a little bit higher than fiscal year ’10 because of the IMFS ramp. But we will get it, I don’t think once we have a plan tend down.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse: And then guys, my last question, just with the migration to 25-nanometer on the NAND Flash front, does that close the gap on gross margins between NAND and DRAM? Or can you help me quantify how big that gap is and how that might trend to the balance of the year?
Ron Foster: First of all, in terms of gross margins on DRAM –
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse: I guess, take a look at it ex the Intel, which you sell the cost.
Ron Foster: Yes. So if you look at and base the trade NAND and core DRAM, the margins are pretty similar today. So that’s – I guess that’s the point of comparison. We are doing really well on the NAND side of the business with the 35-nanometer and full production and 25-nanometer out in front of us, which will give us the bit growth I commented on in the third quarter in NAND. And the technology has really given us leverage on the financial side already at 35. So in general, we are pretty close to parity between the two.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse: Ron, just as a follow-up and my last question, could you actually see NAND – the trade NAND gross margins higher than DRAM in the fiscal third quarter?
Ron Foster: Well, that’s going to – we will have to know what the pricing is (inaudible) my calculation, and we are not trying to – we moved out of the business and forecasting pricing low long time ago.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse: But Steve, it sounds like you have more cost downs in the fiscal third quarter for NAND and you did DRAM. Is that favor?
Steve Appleton: Yes, I think that’s a fair statement.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse: Great. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.
Steve Appleton: 25-nanometer will be significant although it will be ramping in the third quarter, and so it will be – it will post – it would be mainly post third quarter in terms of the big effect on cost down.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse: Great. Thanks, guys.
Steve Appleton: Yes.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our next question in queue comes from Daniel Berenbaum with Auriga USA. Please go ahead.
Daniel Berenbaum – Auriga USA: Hi there. Thanks for taking my question. But can we just reiterate the guidance on DRAM? I thought I heard no cost reduction and basically flat bit growth. So (inaudible) how to do that correct and then we’ll talk about some of the mechanics there and then expectations for full year.
Steve Appleton: Yes, Daniel, you got it right.
Daniel Berenbaum – Auriga USA: Okay. So flat bit growth, flat cost reduction, and i.e. I guess I’m struggling to understand a little bit the mechanics of flat bit growth. Are you taking capacity offline at Inotera due to the conversion?
Mark Adams: Yes. Well, we have a couple things going on. One is, (inaudible). First of all, on our specialty products, remember that we are not driving on cost reductions for bit on those products because they are higher margin, more customized and they could not migrate on the process technologies fast. So that’s part of our business. You won’t expect to see something more. And we are giving obviously an average figure for the quarter. Secondly, Inotera is in fact in transition, and we are currently utilizing bits out of that facility in two different range. One, as we go to states, primarily change product and it’s our normal technology, and then secondly, they are under-utilizing the facility in order to be able to prepare for the transition to Micron Technology. So even though we will have cost per bit reduction internally in Micron’s core DRAM business where it’s being counter-affected by what’s going on elsewhere. And that’s obviously a temporary effect, but that’s what we are going to experience for the next quarter.
Ron Foster: (inaudible) we are on a margin pricing model, as I mentioned earlier in my comments. And it’s a function of how the pricing is moving in the marketplace. As I commented that effectiveness in Q2 in the margin sharing formula that comes through our cost of sales and the trajectory would indicate some more effects in Q3, and then we get our share of the net income from Inotera on the equity method investment line of our P&L.
Daniel Berenbaum – Auriga USA: So you would expect that number to become more positive next quarter?
Ron Foster: Yes, and actually following as they ramp up their technology.
Daniel Berenbaum – Auriga USA: Okay. And then just last question back just on the bit growth and cost reduction, so flat for next quarter, but then how do you see the rest of the calendar year playing out? I mean, should we expect sort of flat bit growth and flat cost reduction for a couple quarters or do you resume some normal trajectory? And can you give us an idea what that is?
Ron Foster: We wanted to extend it out for the year rather than if you go back to the analyst meeting, we did put a chart up that said if you go from calendar Q4 of ’09 to calendar Q4 of 2011; we’re going to be down about 180%. But I can’t tell you the cost reductions accelerate throughout this calendar year as the shrink comes on play.
Daniel Berenbaum – Auriga USA: So they would – so maybe just help me out with the math if I were to just peanut butter that 180% across all the rest of the calendars through the end of the year, what kind of quarterly run rate would that get me?
Ron Foster: You could certainly try that, but I guarantee, it won’t be linear.
Daniel Berenbaum – Auriga USA: Okay. Understanding it won’t be linear, but in my imaginary world, if it was, what would that number be?
Ron Foster: I think you can do the math quicker than I can on this call.
Daniel Berenbaum – Auriga USA: Okay. All right. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question in queue comes from Tim Luke with Barclays Capital. Your line is open.
Tim Luke – Barclays Capital: Thanks so much. Just to clarify then, could you just give us the bit growth that functions again on the NAND side in the coming quarter? And if we were to get it from here on in the quarter, what would your assumption be for ASP with respect to both DRAM and the NAND as of now?
Steve Appleton: Sure. I’ll take the first part of that and then turn it back over to Mark Adams. We guided that NAND production bit growth should be up mid-to-high teens and cost reductions down high-single digits.
Mark Adams: And on the ASP forecast, we typically don’t go and look out to the future (inaudible) quarter-to-date update. On the DRAM side, I commented earlier that it’s mid-single digits of our weighted average cost from last quarter, and on the NAND side, it’s basically flat quarter-over-quarter to where we are and then quarter-to-date.
Tim Luke – Barclays Capital: Okay. Steve, I was wondering if you might have any commentary on how you are seeing the industry bit growth in the DRAM side to begin to shape up as you move through the year. It would seem that having hot on industry number in the 40% to 50% range, given the strength in pricing that you are seeing some of the players begin to edge that upwards, how do you think that plays out? And you have seen some of the major players begin to analyze [ph] the CapEx. Obviously that’s more of a 2011 impact, how do you see that playing out?
Steve Appleton: Well, I think the way to look at it in general is technology transitions, which is really what everybody is focused on today, primarily technology transitions, that’s been able to generate somewhere in the 40% range of the growth per year. Sometime it’s a little bit lower, sometime it’s a little bit higher. And that’s where we are focused on. Now some may – some occurrences are happening whereby as an example, we’re going from a 70-nanometer trench product to a 50-nanometer DRAM stack technology, and the acceleration might be higher in some instances around certain facilities. So if you look at kind of the industry supplied data, Gartner et cetera, you will notice that they are one of the lines of what you just said. They are all kind of running in this 40% to 50% range. And that’s probably about where it’s going to be. In order to get beyond that, you have to have new silicon. And we just still see new silicon at the normal (inaudible).
Tim Luke – Barclays Capital: How about the CapEx increases accounted by some of the larger players and some of the (inaudible) that’s going out next year?
Steve Appleton: Yes. I’d rather finish rolling up. I’ve seen a lot of CapEx forecast that had either been cutting out or don’t materialize at all. So I wouldn’t – I don’t know how to interpret in aggregate all these CapEx forecast that some of these companies have. I will tell you that there has already been known by others that the equipment industry also has its own challenges in terms of these big fluctuations in CapEx requirements. And so we are somewhat mitigating the fact no matter what anybody wants to do, go through time as a result of the strength.
Tim Luke – Barclays Capital: Right. Perhaps just the run-off of – just for the coming quarter, how should we think about the revenue contribution from Numonyx or when should we start putting in what range of additional revenue from your addition?
Steve Appleton: I don’t think – we are currently in, which is obviously our third fiscal quarter. Automatically, there will be much if any impact there. There might be some. I mean, we hopefully would get it close. But the way to think about is it would have an impact in our fourth quarter if we are able to close it before then, and we’ve already released what their prior quarterly revenue was. That is still the good numbers we have, and I think you should think about that being added to Micron’s revenue number for the fourth quarter. I’m feeling that we are able to close in that timeframe.
Tim Luke – Barclays Capital: Okay. Maybe just going forward for the year, you kept the R&D and SG&A operating expenses pretty in line with where the street models have been. How should we think about that as we go through into the August period and beyond? Are there any other factors we should be aware of, given the higher demand and also higher pricing?
Steve Appleton: Well, we think our model is pretty leveraged. As we said before, we liked where we were given that we add facilities that are capable of being optimized, and essentially we are making the investments that we needed to make in order to move the technology forward. Remember that once we have Numonyx, obviously we have additional R&D dollars that will flow through there because they have R&D budgets they work on as well. The same for SG&A. Clearly, over time we will be able to flow through that and optimize the model. But – so I think the way to think of it is, we may on the margin have some incremental SG&A and R&D. And as an example, as the company continues to perform well, we will continue to have some additional SG&A just from our incentive comp programs and things that we have to do there. So – but there is nothing large on the horizon I think if that’s what you’re trying to get at. We will note any dramatic changes from the models there [ph].
Tim Luke – Barclays Capital: Congratulations. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our next question in queue comes from Vijay Rakesh with ThinkEquity. Please go ahead with your question.
Vijay Rakesh – ThinkEquity: Hi, guys. Just a couple of questions. So you mentioned flat bit growth and flat cost in the next quarter. But if the market is picking up with solar, and obviously you have capacity. I mean, your data seems to be coming off. Won’t you see some DRAM pricing start to serve quite a bit more? Is that – go ahead.
Steve Appleton: I think your thought process is similar to others. We would have expected, as we said in the last quarter, to have our – we basically do the seasonality period. And the US economy, as you know, is kind of doing okay, but not fantastic. And I think we’ve seen strength in some segments that we didn’t expect to see. But the reality is the worldwide economic recovery and strong engine, we just don’t think happened yet. And we come through a reasonably strong seasonal period that then really turned out to be all that slow. And we are in a period now where at least historically there has been a momentum and interrupt through the fiscal season. So I will move out of speculation and price forecasting to others. But if you look at the economic fundamentals at the moment, I can understand why people are thinking like that.
Vijay Rakesh – ThinkEquity: And how as well as DRAM pricing trended so far on a branded basis for the quarter – in the current quarter?
Steve Appleton: Quarter-to-date it’s up in the mid-single digits. And as I mentioned in my comments earlier, the DDR3 remains pretty healthy. And we’ve been pleasantly surprised by a very strong DDR2 market, which I mentioned was at bit parity into the spot market versus DDR3 today.
Vijay Rakesh – ThinkEquity: On the NAND side, obviously you guys brought a 20-nanometer NAND last year, late last year, how much of the output today is on 20% NAND and what’s your mix on 3-bit?
Steve Appleton: So the NAND output today on 3-bit is relatively muted to less than 5%. The 34-nanometer NAND as a percent of total has peaked and is now starting down as we ramp a 25-nanometer NAND, and it really has been essentially 100% other than legacy demands for mobile devices, specialty devices, SOC type products.
Vijay Rakesh – ThinkEquity: And last question, Rambus, any – you want to add any color on that, anything coming up there?
Steve Appleton: Well, that trial has been delayed again, and I just don’t have any sense as to when that will occur.
Vijay Rakesh – ThinkEquity: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Steve Appleton: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question in queue comes from Shawn Webster with Macquarie Capital. Your question, please.
Shawn Webster – Macquarie Capital: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. You guys talked about what the shipments were in your February quarter and what your outlook for production-wise. Can you share with us what your DRAM production and NAND production did sequentially in your February quarter?
Mark Adams: Sure can. We did DRAM bit production in Q2, up low-double digits, and NAND was down slightly.
Shawn Webster – Macquarie Capital: Okay, thank you. And how about total wafer production sequentially for February?
Mark Adams: Fairly flat.
Shawn Webster – Macquarie Capital: Okay. And then what are your OEM customers telling you to expect in terms of seasonality as we go into calendar Q2 and calendar Q3 and versus normal for the industry?
Mark Adams: Relative to overall demand or bit growth, what’s the question?
Shawn Webster – Macquarie Capital: Bit demand expectations going into calendar Q2 and calendar Q3 that you are hearing from your OEM customers right now.
Mark Adams: I think depending on the segment (inaudible) kind of scales differently but overall on a quarterly basis, we are seeing kind of DRAM bit growth in the low-to-mid double-digit percentage, 10% to 15% in that range. On the NAND side, little bit more elasticity towards the holiday season, but still low-double digits up to maybe 5% to 20% depending on again the segments we serve.
Shawn Webster – Macquarie Capital: And that’s for both Q2 and – calendar Q2 and calendar Q3?
Mark Adams: Yes, that’s quarterly bit growth, that’s right.
Shawn Webster – Macquarie Capital: Okay. And then you guys have already commented a bit on the inventories. In the past, you’ve given some color on weeks of channel inventory. Is there any data you can share with us on that now?
Mark Adams: We have not seen any build in our channel inventory. As a matter of fact, we left our last quarter probably lower than the prior quarter. I don’t have the numbers right in front of me, but we’re right around on average three weeks, and I think we’re slightly below that in the channel from that this quarter.
Shawn Webster – Macquarie Capital: Okay. Three weeks. What is the normal level for you guys?
Mark Adams: In that three-week period, it’s well above [ph] that. And coming out of the holidays, we remained pretty lean in the channel. That’s why (inaudible) inventory still being tough to imagine right now.
Shawn Webster – Macquarie Capital: Okay. But just to clarify, you said as three weeks, but normal levels would be what again?
Mark Adams: Still in that three, four-week, that’s a little bit lower than how we are today.
Shawn Webster – Macquarie Capital: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question in queue comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
David Wong – Wells Fargo: Thank you very much. Are you seeing any effect from the news that (inaudible) AMB affecting several memory demand?
Steve Appleton: David, if I understood your question right, you are asking if we’ve seen any impact from the new microprocessors out of AMB. Is that correct?
David Wong – Wells Fargo: Into an AMB, yes. Are these affecting your set of memory demand?
Steve Appleton: Really we can’t discern between the two. And most of our guidance on bit growth incorporates all of those changes that we are seeing in the mix from our customers. So no particular commentary on a given microprocessor set.
David Wong – Wells Fargo: Okay. And internally at Micron and also your estimate for DRAM companies in the industry, what were the weeks of inventory?
Ron Foster: We don’t have an estimate for the other DRAM companies in the industry. What was your question, David?
David Wong – Wells Fargo: Was then on Micron – what were your weeks of inventory end of the quarter at Micron?
Steve Appleton: Mark Adams just said that it was –
Mark Adams: I certainly mean the channel – weeks of inventory of the channel.
David Wong – Wells Fargo: No, I mean, at Micron.
Mark Adams: Turns are running about five. We run about five turns.
David Wong – Wells Fargo: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question in queue comes from Daniel Amir with Lazard Capital. Please go ahead.
Lauren Stoller – Lazard Capital: Hi. This is Lauren Stoller in for Daniel. Thanks for taking my question. So, as bits continue to increase from Inotera, should we expect to see royalties increase as well? Hello?
Ron Foster: This is Ron. Today we collect royalties on the legacy technology 68 and 50-nanometer technologies. We have that continuing to come through pretty much from our partner in Inotera and Nanya. Going forward, the arrangement is that there are payments that will term on the stack technology nodes going forward on a scale that we’ve mentioned in the past. We are evaluating with our partner how to deal with the structure of those royalty payments due to changes in Taiwanese tax law. We expect the economics will be the same, but we are working on the structure that’s more amenable from the tax standpoint. But the way to think about it is there will be a flow coming from stack technology over time.
Lauren Stoller – Lazard Capital: Okay. And that flow could be seen in royalties or in the form of the net income that you were talking about earlier?
Ron Foster: It will come in on the P&L, the landscape could be different depending upon what we do relative to the law changes.
Lauren Stoller – Lazard Capital: All right. And then what’s the timeline for that?
Ron Foster: Timeline, when the production starts, we will have to have that structure resolved. And Nanya is actually starting up on their production of the stack technologies now. So some of that is just beginning to happen.
Lauren Stoller – Lazard Capital: Okay, great. And then if I understand correctly, I understand that your costs are going to be relatively flat on the DRAM side because of all the moving part. But as bits continue to increase from Nanya and Inotera, will cost go up? Might we see a situation like that?
Ron Foster: There is really the couple of facts and the guidance on DRAM. One is that our cost per bit on the Micron bits is continuing to decline as it did in the second quarter, and we expect that to decline in the third quarter. In terms of the Inotera production, there are two factors. One is that the process is converting to our 50-nanometer stack technology. So as Steve mentioned earlier, there is some impact in terms of the startup costs, and that startup thing will affect us in the relatively short-term, third quarter namely. And then they will ramp into production and be driving that cost down exiting third quarter to fourth and onward. The other piece is that, as I commented in my prepared remarks, we have a margin sharing arrangement with Inotera, and so when Micron is making significant profits due to high margin, that is shared through a pricing formula with Inotera that raises our cost per bit of Inotera production. It actually affected us some in Q2, and I expect it will affect us some in Q3. But bear in mind that we have a minority interest share, which shows on our P&L on the – in the net income in a different location. So we get the benefit of Inotera’s profitability on our share. Also in our P&L, it just shows up in the equity method investment line and not coming through our margin line.
Lauren Stoller – Lazard Capital: Okay. And then can we take your inventory comment to cover both DRAM and NAND?
Ron Foster: Micron inventory?
Lauren Stoller – Lazard Capital: No, sorry, inventory in the channel.
Ron Foster: Yes, very much today they are – both NAND and DRAM are currently in the same levels.
Lauren Stoller – Lazard Capital: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question in queue comes from Kevin Cassidy with Thomas Weisel. Please go ahead.
Kevin Cassidy – Thomas Weisel: Thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe along the same lines of NAND, you mentioned your SSDs are on allocation. I wonder if you could tell us little more details of what’s happening there. Is it because of supply being short or is there some other bottleneck?
Mark Adams: I think it’s that coupled with demands of our product line that’s gotten a lot of (inaudible) in the press. We launched a product at CES this year. And as I mentioned, we, last quarter, Q2, began shipping to some OEM customers, and we opened some of our allocation to how to choose the channel and our online website crucial.com. The results were phenomenal. And we are a little bit strategy constraint on available NAND for that product line. So – and (inaudible).
Kevin Cassidy – Thomas Weisel: Can you give us relative – tell us how many units are shipping?
Mark Adams: We particularly don’t do that for competitive [ph] reasons.
Kevin Cassidy – Thomas Weisel: Okay. And I guess are there any other puts and takes, or I guess how much did you under-ship that?
Mark Adams: This is – again, I wanted to qualify when you don’t – you don’t know what (inaudible) on demand. We guess that we were pretty tight. Crucial.com is at one data point sold out within two business days of the allocation we gave.
Kevin Cassidy – Thomas Weisel: Okay. Maybe just one other question, do you have an idea when you might be able to catch up to the demand?
Mark Adams: Not a good picture today. I think we’re certainly increasing production, but don’t have a good sense at least to exclude that quarter yet.
Kevin Cassidy – Thomas Weisel: Okay. Thanks for taking my question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question in queue comes from Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Hans Mosesmann – Raymond James: Thanks. I just have one – real quick one, DDR2. What’s driving you to move up to DDR3 prices? Is it that OEMs can’t get the DDR3 or going back to DDR2 and using older microprocessors?
Mark Adams: Yes. There is really – our guess is kind of the supply and demand questions kind of playing out right in front of us. If you go back and look at DRAM exchange in late January, one gigabit DDR2 component was under $2. And as recently as I guess yesterday, it rises up over $3 in the spot market. So it really is available parts in the industry, and people are trying to get as much as they can of these A-products out of the door.
Hans Mosesmann – Raymond James: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question in queue comes from Bob Gujavarty with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Bob Gujavarty – Deutsche Bank: Thanks for squeezing me in. Last quarter you kind of ranked profitability by – as the specialty DRAM and IDRAM and NAND. Could you do that again for this quarter?
Steve Appleton: Sure. It’s getting easier. The highest gross margin product continues to be specialty DRAM. And as Ron mentioned earlier, basically our core DRAM and trade NAND is right on top of each other in the number two spot.
Bob Gujavarty – Deutsche Bank: Okay, great. And a little clarification on the NAND ASPs, when you commented it was flat, does that include trade as well as what you felt Intel cost or was there a big diversion between the two?
Ron Foster: The comment was that both NAND trade and total NAND ASPs were actually flat in terms of change quarter-to-quarter. Bear in mind that the Intel NAND is at cost, so it’s roughly going to be consistent so that the trade numbers and the total numbers moved in parity with each other.
Bob Gujavarty – Deutsche Bank: Great. And also when you threw out the CapEx numbers for this year, 850 to 950, and also intimated for next year, that doesn’t – that's a gross number. It doesn’t include any potential part or contributions, correct?
Ron Foster: It does not – that is correct. It’s the total CapEx for all of our consolidated operations. So it does not include partner contributions for our Intel-Micron joint venture activities.
Bob Gujavarty – Deutsche Bank: And that isn’t such a high number. I mean, any contribution would reduce the net number.
Ron Foster: Yes, it would reduce – that's exactly right. It would reduce our net cash requirements, but it shows up – but it doesn’t show up in the CapEx number. It would show up as a contribution from partners in our cash flow.
Bob Gujavarty – Deutsche Bank: Great. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.
Kipp Bedard: Thanks, Bob. And with that, we would like to thank everyone for participating on the call today. If you would please bear with me, I need to repeat the Safe Harbor protection language.

We are no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of the presentation to confirm these statements to actual results. I’ll now turn the call over to Mr. Ron Foster. Ron.
Ron Foster: Our press release is available on our website. Let me start after the brief summary of the financial results of the first quarter of fiscal 2010, which ended December 3, 2009. The company reported net income of $204 million or $0.23 per diluted share, our net sales of $1.7 billion. This is our first quarter of profitability in the past 12 quarters and is our highest quarterly revenue since Q1 2001, with the profitability from the first quarter, a couple items are triggered. First some potentially diluted securities become dilutive and are included in a number of shares used to compute EPS. This includes in the money stock options as well as our convertible debt securities. Second, certain accruals for variable pay programs were recognized in Q1, where payouts are tied to financial performance. This expense showed up primarily in SG&A. In addition, with the beginning of this fiscal year, a couple of new accounting rules are effective for Micron; the cost is to recast prior financial statements to confirm to the new presentation format. First, to the FASB staff position on convertible debt instruments caused us to bifurcate the accounting for our 2007 $1.3 billion convertible security into their separate debt and equity components. Accordingly, about $300 million was reclassified from debt into additional capital in the equity section as of the beginning of fiscal 2010. The remaining $1 billion balance classified to debt is accreted to the $1.3 billion face amount of the security to step up non-cash interest expense over the remaining term of the security. This resulted in an additional $13 million of non-cash interest expense in the first quarter and will be about the same amount in each of the remaining quarters in this fiscal year. If you recall, our fourth quarter posted a net loss of $88 million, or $0.10 per diluted shares, our net sales of $1.3 billion. With this increase in non-cash interest expense, the Q4 net loss has been increased to $100 million and $0.12 diluted share. The second item is the reclassification of minority interest, or noncontrolling interest on both the balance sheet and income statement. On the balance sheet, noncontrolling interest is classified as a component of equity, were previously it was classified in the mezzanine between liabilities and equity. On the income statement, noncontrolling interest is classified below net income and before net income attributable to Micron shareholders. Note, that the bottom line of our income statement that used to be net income is now called net income attributable to Micron shareholders. In addition of these changes, we have modified the reportable segments you will in our 10-Q filing to include memory and other. This other segment includes our imaging business and some recently initiated activities primarily surrounding our silicon systems groups, which includes LED display and others. Now these activities are individually significant at this point. Now let’s move onto discuss the results for the quarter. Total sales in the first quarter increased 34% compared to the fourth quarter as a result of higher sales in memory products. Sales in memory products increased 38%, while sales of image sensors decreased 13%. Imaging revenue was $108 million in the first quarter and represented 6% of the Micron consolidated net sales. Recall of the first quarter results reflect our manufacturing services, including wafer fabrication to Aptina, following a spin off of that business in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned previously, we continue to account for our ownership interest in Aptina under the equity method of accounting. Memory sales include royalties and technology fees of $35 million, which is roughly flat compared to previous quarter. DRAM sales increased 50%, compared to the fourth quarter to just over $1 billion, primarily due to a 25% increase in bit shipments and 21% higher average selling prices. Sales of NAND Flash products increased 21%, compared to the fourth quarter to $568 million, primarily due to a 16% increase in sales volume and 5% increase in average selling price. The DRAM quarterly average selling price increased in the first quarter from the second consecutive quarter, after declines in the prior 11 quarters. The 21% increase in DRAM selling prices reflects the effects of a 32% increased in selling prices for core DRAM products, which was partially offset by the continued mix shift toward core products from the relatively higher price specialty DRAM products. The greater mix of core DRAM products comes mainly from increased volumes from Inotera. DRAM production costs excluding the effects of the lower of cost of market write-down and idle facility costs decreased 9% compared to the fourth quarter. The increase in production of core DRAM products from Inotera contributed to the cost decreases as core DRAM products generally had a lower cost per bit compared to the portfolio average. DRAM cost reductions in fiscal Q2 are expected to be in a high single digits and bit production is forecast to increase in the low teens including the supply from Inotera. NAND trade selling prices in the first quarter also improved significantly up 14% sequentially, this improvement in trade prices was partially offset by sales to our NAND partner Intel which are sold negotiated prices approximating cost. NAND production cost per bit increased 8% in the first quarter compared to the previous quarter. As our 34 nanometer process technology achieved mature yields. NAND cost reductions in a fiscal second quarter are expected to be in the high single digits again and bit productions forecast to be relatively flat compared to the first quarter as we have reached full production on our 34 nanometer process and prepared transition to the next process note. R&D and SG&A expenses for the first quarter came in at 8% and less than 6% of revenue respectively, both within our target range for operating expenses. SG&A cost in the first quarter increased compared to the previous quarter due to accruals in the quarter relating to the incentive pay compensation plans that I mentioned earlier. Future quarter should be impacted less by these accruals. We anticipate SG&A expenses in the second quarter at fiscal 2010 to be around $85 million to $95 million and R&D expenses to be in $135 million to $145 million range. Other non-operating income in the first quarter includes a credit of $56 million which is a gain recognize through equity method accounting for interest in Inotera relating to their recent issue of equity securities at a price exceeding our carrying value. Currency exchange rate loss in the quarter exceeded $20 million as the dollar weakened against euro, Sing dollar and yen. The first quarter enter with nearly $1.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet which includes the cash flow from operating activities of $326 million in the first quarter. We continue to generate positive free cash flow yielding $215 million in the quarter. Operating cash flow was adversely affected by an increase in the quarter end balance of accounts receivable, which is partly due to the higher level of sales in the first quarter and partly due to a greater mix of sales to contract OEM customers as increasing demand from OEM customers is taking a greater percentage of our available production. Sales terms to our OEM customers are generally slightly longer then terms for our channel customers. This led to an increase in our day sales outstanding compared to the previous quarter although it is still within our regular operating range. Despite significant production increases, inventory increased only 5% in the first quarter compared to the prior year end mostly in finish goods. The net effective inventory write-downs did not have a significant impact on the margins in the first quarter and remaining affect the previous write-downs on any inventory balances as of the end of the first quarter is not significant. With respect to our consolidated joint ventures, distributions were made to JV partners and approximately $88 million in the first quarter, which consisted distributions from IM Flash to Intel. With that, I’ll close here and turn the commentary over to Mark Adams. Mark.
Mark Adams: Thanks, Ron. I had mentioned that our last call that the demand signaled from our key customers appeared strong gain to the Holiday season and that as indeed, what we experienced in our fiscal Q1. For our third consecutive quarter, we experienced a strong increase in bit shipments in both our DRAM and NAND businesses. The bit shipment increase was driven by continued demand improvement across most of our key markets including computing specialty DRAM in the consumer markets. In addition to the bit shipment growth in DRAM and NAND, we also saw as the improvement in both segments. While the end of the Holiday season, it’s historically a time or demand can ease due to seasonality, demand for Micron product remained strong as we entered calendar 2010. Revenue from our personal computing business, which includes desktop computing, notebooks and netbooks, was up over 80% due to a strong price environment and a substantial increase in bit production coming from Inotera. Rummy of the core, DRAM markets, we saw continued growth in our server business with revenue up over 25% quarter-over-quarter. Our networking and storage business achieved roughly 30% growth increase in bits shipped and remained the strong market for Micron, especially DRAM products. All in all, demand for Micron DRAM products remains robust as we continued to face allegation challenges our numerous designed IDs to support our strategic customers. We continue to see a shift towards DDR3 Memory in Q1. Bit shipments of DDR3 product, increased approximately 60% quarter-over-quarter and this is after a Q4 what we experienced strong growth. DDR3 represented 40% of core DRAM bit shipments in Q1. Micron Technology in completed with the DDR3 possessing a unique competitive position to capitalize in the growth in DDR3 demand coming from both DC and server related customers. In addition to the growth in DDR3, DDR2 also grew in bit shipment in revenue during our first quarter. Our mobile business continued during key impressive growth, revenue was up over 60% in the quarter. We see our Micron’s broad product portfolio products and at the mobile segment including mobile low for DRAM, MCPs, PSRAM products add on NAND based technology mobile memory cards remains a competitive differentiator as we look to expand customer in the segment. For our pricing perspective ASP for our DRAM business were up significantly despite the mix shift driven by the commodity DDR 2 product from Inotera which has the lower ASP versus our portfolio average. Inotera OEM contract price follow the spot market trends from our Q4 which held continue the upper trend in Q1 ASPs. We are seeing strong demand and price support from what we left Q1 with price is up 5% quarter-to-date versus the average of Q1. While there is some precedent from the past for seasonal drop in DRAM prices in our Q2, we are encouraged by the strong demand of stable pricing we have seen so far this quarter. NAND from Micron Flash memory products remains strong as well. In Q1 here we all of our NAND products shipments were based on our industry leading 34 nanometer technology. We feel this technology provide us strong profit managed and that’s a latter of our NAND business continue making strong contribution to our operating results. It is also worthy to note that Micron launched our real SSD C3100 product which represent the highest performance drive in its class on the market. This allowed us to cultivate additional design wind that hands out for a strong year in 2010 for SSD business. We continue to be fleet with out retail business which includes the left our branded flash memory products. The crucial after market DRAM model operates in our world wining crucial.com eCommerce business. The price environment in the DRAM and NAND component markets as let the more stable pricing and consumer end user segment. These combined market conditions have helped the retail business and Micron continue to make positive contribution in our first quarter. Overall we continue to see a relatively strong retail sector to the holiday season. Retailers are prudent in the inventory management coming out of last years challenging conditions. In addition we are seeing improved sale through year-over-year and that’s remains bullish heading into the new calendar year. Great component pricing for NAND memory increased in Q1. Coming off an increasing ASP market for most of 2009 in NAND we managed to drive quarter-over-quarter NAND ASPs up 14% in Q1 by sales of most of our product yield OEM customers. Although quarter they were seeing NAND ASPs down roughly 10% this is well with our expectations given the consumer driven seasonality of the flash memory. We continue to see the market migrate to higher density chips then we fill bit consumption will continue to grow throughout 2010. It’s amazing to thing that in 2010 some smartphones are projected to ship with 64 gigabits of NAND Flash which is roughly the same side of hard drive and a notebook computer within last 24 months. We remain optimistic their market segments such as mobile, notebooks, and SSDs will continue to drive strong big consumption and that NAND market will be in balance during the course of 2010 As we quote the calendar year 2009, we may encouraged by the strong demand from all of our customers. We enjoyed our hubs and distribution channels remain very tight. We’ve mentioned that our recent calls that we felt the reduction in capital expenditures that we saw in 2009 will lead the more stability in our business. As we entered calendar year 2010, we are optimistic that these favorable market that useful conditions will continue. With that, I’ll hand it back over to Kipp.
Kipp Bedard: Thanks Mark. We will now take questions from callers. (Operator Instructions) With that, we’d like to take questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer: It seems like you still got some pretty good headroom and execution on the DRAM spite, specifically with Inotera, but it sounds like your near term constrained in terms of your capacity, particularly, 34 nanometer for NAND. So, could you just help me out explain what the capacity is, or that strategy for capacity growth at NAND? Is that 34 nanometer at this fiscal year and whether not you planned to revisit or where you are in terms of revisiting your CapEx budget plans first 2010? Where you are in terms of revisiting your decision about IM Flash in Singapore? 
Mark Durcan: First of all on the 34 nanometer front, we continue to fine tune our operations as always to optimize any cap, slightly better cap loss or utilization, but new story for us in 2010 at this point is the transition of 2x node, which we have been saying for sometime will occur throughout the year. So that should drive. It’s a pretty significant shrink went up and position to say exactly how big that is yet, but we seen will be sampling and you’ll have the access than information, but its pretty significant shirk force and should drive some pretty significant bit growth. Beyond that obviously, we’re looking at lots of different alternatives has to how we might add additional scoring to the silicon on a go forward basis, but we’re not really in a position to talk about exactly where or when that might occur at this point.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer: Just a quick follow-up here, Ron, a question for you, just if you can help me understand some of the break points are, how you calculate the $0.23 number, obviously if I take 204 in terms of net income divide by 1 billion shares outstanding on, I don’t get $0.23, I guess $0.20. So, is there anything you can help me in terms of modeling on it converted basis on getting to that number? How I should model that going forward?
Ron Foster: First of all, we have to take the most diluted calculation and computing our EPS. So, the effect you see here is, you can get to by adding back the interest expense on the converts into net income and then dividing by the weighted average shares including the convert shares, which shows in your share deviser it with the one billion share count. So, that’s are you get to the EPS number and we compute both with conversion as if diluted and without conversion to see which one has the most diluted affect and that’s the EPS number that we required report by gap accounting. So, if you give a little bit more specific perspective on how at works to be take our $1.3 billion convert, it will converts and NAND convert to accounting basis are about $190 million of net income. So, since we are over $190 million the share count which was $91 million shares goes into our diluted shares and that’s $90 million of interest income they gets added back to the net income line and that’s how get to the EPS number on that particular convert we have to through each one to come up with the math the best way to approach.
Operator: Your next question comes from Daniel Amir - Lazard
Daniel Amir - Lazard: In terms of your DRAM can you provide time to mix between core and non-core mix of the past quarter and kind of where do you see that tracking into next year?
Kipp Bedard: In terms of core DRAM we are in fiscal Q1 that was up 45% revenue, specialty DRAM was around 13% and total NAND was around 33% was that ends up about 98 and the other 2% is captured in the royalty line. I am not stay way I think from given to any guidance on predicting more those goals because as you know there is so much it is related to the ASP changes.
Daniel Amir - Lazard: So, maybe a follow up question for that I mean where do you see the state of DRAM industry right now after a year that’s started in a very challenging talked about consolidation never consolidated really in Taiwan, but where do we go into next year and kind of how do you key the PC markets playing a roll in the DRAM industry.
Steve Appleton:  With respect I think the state of the suppliers, we ended the year obviously in a pretty difficult situation and subsequently I would say probably within the 60 to 90 days or biting 2009 about a third of the world capacity came offline. Some of it, as you know never came back online, i.e. menthol bankruptcy and that is essentially a liquidated and most of those are gone or ready to not in production or never will be now or as you know, if you got the media TI basically, but all the use of 300 millimeter from the U.S. facility is now using until the capacity. So that never came back on and it’s been following in Taiwan. I think all of the capacity at this point in time, the best we can tell, all the capacity that could have come back online is back online and those that have access to financing our funds are essentially just merging down the path of updated technology and those really, I would say Samsung and Micron that positive in the best position both DRAM and NAND and then the others, I’ll trying to figure out how to do that, but as you know, most of them never lot of debt that they’re also facing and trying to apple. The interest analysis, last week taking with one of the CEOs in improvement business and I didn’t know the statistic, but if what I said was true, it’s the first time that never happened at least in try star in this business and that as of this moment, there are no new fabs in the constructions for the memory business and then nobody know well. There are fabs that have been constructed, obviously Micron has the Singapore one and they’re optimizing the Inotera operation and so far so, clearly it was cut based to optimize to the sales that they already have, but down the hill I assume that there are just no new fabs in the construction in the memory business and that’s the first time I can ever remember that being the case, if I entered the business totally seven year ago. So what happens in 2010 is always depending upon what happens in the broader economy and I would tell you that, I think some of the success that we’re experiencing now, which is due to our own competitiveness or due to a lack of supply in the marketplace. It’s one of those two things. It’s not really because of demand so great is on fire and the economy is recovered because I think most people know that simply not the case. To the extent that we actually do get an economy environment that starts to recover that you have those of the variable circumstances for the memory industry. Then with respect to how much the PC is going to play role going forward, I’m going to turn it back over to Mark Adams your comment.
Mark Adams: I think from a PC and even from a server sector, what we’re seeing is continue to upside on the commercial enterprise markets, continued investment on the infrastructure side was been very strong and only one if you could take advantage from proportionally a mix on the desktop notebook side of the house, things look a little bit better coming out December than we might have projected.  I think a lot of that has to do with company’s putting off purchases than the longer cutting off in that application as well, so in computing overall pretty favorable and we are sitting even slightly increased density for bob which is upping on the demand curve as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jay Lu - Auriga USA.
Jay Lu - Auriga USA: I got two questions, the first is, what is the maximum supply bit growth that you think is possible for 2010 for DRAM?
Ron Foster: The ranges we’re saying for DRAM are out there anywhere if it’s a wide range of 30% on the low end to about 50% on the high end.
Jay Lu - Auriga USA: So you think that a 40% life case?
Ron Foster: Probably, as you know, we’ve been chatting about a lot of that just depends on how successful each company is executing the shrink strategy.
Jay Lu - Auriga USA: My follow on question is your use of cash. As you generate in terms of cash, are you think about acquisitions again?
Kipp Bedard: I think that, currently we want to be pretty flexible in terms of how we think about what additional consolidation it can happen in the memory business. I think you can expect us to be fairly conservative as you might have imagine, a lot of accounts will be going in the 2010, we leverage our balance sheet a little bit in the last year or two and we’re still looking at, how much to be deleverage that. In addition, as you already noted, we have some facilities they’re capable of taking additional equipment for capacity and we’re always of course looking at that and then M&A front, we still think there’s some opportunity out there. So, I would say that, we’re going to keep some of our powder dry at this point, as we look at these various alternatives, but currently we think we’ll be moving forward from a position of strength and being able to take advantage in advance in any of the directions we wanted to grow, but we as you know we think, we’re in a pretty good position in terms of what cash generation will report.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tim Luke - Barclays Capital.
Tim Luke - Barclays Capital: I was wondering, if you might be have to give a comment on you see inventory under OEM both in the channel broadly and coming out of the quarter maybe wondering both if you might have been and its provide some color on how you seen NAND did great for the period 2010, thank you?
Mark Adams: I will take the inventory question. Now I believe things are still very tight both in the OEM side and that’s we can see and our channel and as I mentioned in earlier comments in our hubs and it really across the board and all application we’re trying to do our best to meet the customer needs, but its I think a lot of its driven as Steve said demand is the demand as pretty good but not staggering upside in demand what we see is just a lot more prudent management coming in a last years down turn and the inventory levels being appropriate for the time and coming out of the holidays we are pretty tight going in the calendar year 2010.
Kipp Bedard:  On the supply side we are seeing estimates of in the 80% to 90% supply bit growth in 2010 over 2009.
Tim Luke - Barclays Capital: How should we think about how you will approach your big great in direct board come with different element to come into your consideration and then lastly if I could get just squeeze in a last question on you had a very significant improvement in your gross margin what are some of the key variables in that going forward.
Mark Durcan:  Let me cover the NAND capacity first. As our alluded to will see at least slightly more silicon in our existing fabs significant technology migration 2x node which, I think for Micron those two combined with drive less than the overall 80% to 90% if you will lumpy throughout the year depending on how it goes as relative to any new silicon that would be 2011 will released.
Ron Foster:  On your gross margin question it obviously as I comment at the ASPs had significant effect in the quarter and pretty broadly across the board in all segments of our business I comment last quarter that we were in the black on gross margin and both DRAM and NAND and obviously where substantially better on both scores as we report this quarter.  We also had idle charges for example last quarter in our cost of sales in those are effectively zero this quarter as we taking in our full production assignment from Inotera and also working on the technology transition as we go through this fiscal year to get them up on our fab technology but in the mean time we are taking all the trend supply and doing well about the market as well. So, all of those contributed to the margin story.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: I guess first question is a little bit around the content pre box issue you toughed on it that you are seeing some good trends, but maybe particularly around some better than expected adoption of 64 bit Window 7 systems, if you could talk about what you see there currently and then in 2010?
Mark Adams: On the debt side of note booking net book arena, some of that overall PC landscape, we’d seen continued increased megabit persistent there. Obviously net book drags that down or wouldn’t in the lot more impressive, but if you go back into terms of overall ‘09, we didn’t quite break through 2.7 range, 2.8 range. As we go into our first quarter, we’re anticipating that to be well over three megabit persistent for both desktop and notebooks. You’ll see that both of the corporate level and even if you do your retail checks, you can see advertise of four megabit systems at pretty good ASPs on the desktop level. The net book piece will took and drive itself to be a low density operating. So all-in-all pretty favorable and certainly better, I think the projections were about six to 12 months back.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: So, even though we’ve really kind of the theoretical limit of what you could use in attribution of notebook or desktop is kind of net through two to three, four ranges? You’re still seeing people go to four. I guess again, if you could talk a little bit about the 64 bit operation system adoption? How you see that right now? Where you could see that goal and what that could need for DRAM content looking forward?
Mark Durcan: I think this is a first Christmas that we’re seeing as a result. I’m not sure, I have all the day, but the adoption right now is pretty strong. So we feel really good about that. I was talking your original question in terms of the contact of where we got for today. We still work pretty good about that adoption both of the corporate level and even in a consumer level instead on all displaced on OEM side, but then maybe Microsoft in the desktop to drive that increasingly. So we feel pretty good about that, but we’ve already got some headway going into we think overall can be very, very positive for us in 2010.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Then maybe final question from me, if the incentive for the OEMs to adopt 64 bit systems of the customers can be buying 64 bit systems right now, so the future proofing the systems could delays many software written right now to take advantage of 64 bit, but it’s just a situation while people kind of thinking ahead open that we expect software to be available or is that some of that’s currently driving what, from a lot of people on the supply chain better than expected adoption in the 64 bit at this point?
Mark Durcan: I think future group holds a lot of water. I would also suggest that, from a channel perspective when people were upgrading their desktop and notebook purchase in their next generation for full system, when I look at the behavior there, they’re certainly looking to add value in the channel side of that business to up sell customers and the people that consumer making the decision is causing them to make that buy at a pretty significant discount at time of purchase versus they have to go back to that downstream.
Operator: Your next question comes from Uche Orji - UBS.
Uche Orji - UBS: Can I just start by asking you about a comment you made on your server business and your revenue growth of 25%? Can you just put us in context of what’s driving the demand and what else kind of incorporates blushful of Q for Q4, or whether this is setting up for as fairly interesting refresh cycle for service or any comment from the server demand that would be helpful?
Ron Foster: Yes, I mean the best comment I could say is that, we were in constrained a number of our product segments that I think server was the leading products in terms of our allocation position we’re in as a company. We gotten multiple upside forecast from just about everybody. So we don’t think it’s a tug of war in between share gains between customer A and customer B. The upside seems to be across the broaden business and ultimately, we could have used a lot more product to ship in the quarter. Our forecast for foreseeable future out in Q1 and Q2 calendar year remained very strong. Both in terms of density, but also in terms of just a number of raw units and it seems to me that the lot of the infrastructure dollars that the government put in place on a global place, is taking hold and where a lot of the dollars being spent both in the enterprise and networking space is driving tremendous upside versus what we might have forecasted it back in the first half of 2009.
Uche Orji - UBS: Another question please, so on your bit demand, your projection for bit supply for Micron, can you tell me how much you think will be to grow net quarter and also where you think you’ll come out by the end of fiscal 2011 and taking into consideration Inotera as well outside. Just trying to make sure I understand, if you can just help us understand how you expect to say that and obviously if you can talk about CapEx. Decreasing of your CapEx, as you can backend loaded or do you have some its way through the year?
Mark Durcan: Sure, on the production side, next quarter will be up low teens and we’re stand away from a full year-over-year number for now. As we have stated, we have a strong growth profile, I think Mark’s mentioned in several conference calls, not only due to our own shrinks, but also the capacity coming on it in Inotera and their shrinks as well. In terms of CapEx as Ron’s mentioned before, it is backend loaded and I’ll turn it over to him for additional details.
Ron Foster: Yes. As we previously said, our guidance for the year is $750 million, $850 million. We spend about $111 million in first quarter. So it’s heavily backend loaded and of course we’ll be monitoring our technology transitions and timing, which can affect that and pull things in or out slightly in the fiscal year. So that’s the range we’re predicting.
Uche Orji - UBS: Just one last question, can you just tell me in terms of your gross margin for core DRAM versus NAND? Just tell me, where the gross margins rank at the moment?
Steve Appleton: As you know, we don’t break them out, but we do rank them for you. We had a real strong quarter has been alluded to by both Mark and Ron on specialty DRAM. So we are No. 1 gross margin. If you look at just our trade NAND, it would be No. 2, core DRAM after that and Imaging after that, and of course topping a list would be the licensing royalty category.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Wong - Wells Fargo.
David Wong - Wells Fargo: Can you give us some idea of what your PC customers are indicating in terms of their bit requirements for the calendar March quarter?
Mark Adams: Going back to my earlier comments, we’re not seeing what might be traditional seasonal pullback in Q1. We’re seeing continued strong demand coming out of the holiday end of year, both in the PC side and the server side, really across all of our segment. We’re not seeing any pullbacks on the demand forecast going into our calendar Q1 and end of our Q2. It seems very strong and support, the best we can see throughout the remainder of our quarter here.
David Wong - Wells Fargo: What were your weeks of inventory for DRAM and trade NAND exiting the quarter?
Mark Adams: We’re running at real minimum. We’re running less than a couple of weeks in both DRAM and NAND.
Operator: Your next question comes from Vijay Rakesh - Thinkequity.
Vijay Rakesh - Thinkequity: Just going back on your license side, given that almost like growing bit growth 70% for 2010? Just wonder what your license expectations you have on the quarterly run rate for 2010?
Ron Foster: We have about $35 million in license revenues. I mentioned, this quarter similar to last quarter. Those are approximate trajectories as we look through the year ago in terms of the payments for our technologies to this point, but don’t have any further adjustments or change to that trajectory to fall on at this point.
Vijay Rakesh - Thinkequity: Going back to the Windows 7 comment, I mean just a little bit. I mean do you have instead of first Christmas, what personally a box that you think approximately a shipping with a higher density per box? If things start to working at favorable, that percentage could go as to move to 2010?
Ron Foster: I think the first of them, if market likes to jump in, we’ve seen various report. It looks like total systems and you’re looking at about 2.7 gigabits expectations for the year or to average some more involves with three-two or three range. Anecdotally, I can tell you that probably had between that last two or three conferences, chatting with people who have bought new systems and here ranges up 9 gigabits to 16 gigabits per system. Now, you guys are pretty powerful users, there’s just anecdotal information to maybe match we have marks. We haven’t seen that demand at the per unit level, but the bit shipment demand that I suggest is pretty healthy is reflective of a trend down that path. We haven’t seen the per unit plus density being around nine or 16 in that range, yes, but we are seeing the forecast from our customers to be pretty staggering from year-over-year from 2010, when we look back at 2009. I think, a lot of that is reflective on the desktop side of that growth.
Vijay Rakesh - Thinkequity: One last question here on the NAND side, what’s your expedition on bit growth for 2010 for the industry and for you?
Ron Foster: We’re again go stay away from Micron prediction, for next quarter it’s fairly flat for us for the industry. We think supply is going to be up about 80% to 90%.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel.
Kevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel: I wonder, if we could change topics a little bit and talk about the RealSSD. You mentioned design winds can you say who they are?
Ron Foster: Yes, normally we don’t comment on those. I will tell you that, obviously we launch the products we’ve been working with some key OEMs on the development ahead of our launch. There are significant customers and we are very excited about the progress over last quarter.
Kevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel: It’s mainly desktop right are in the book?
Ron Foster: Today, the current design winds that I’ve referred to you were desktop with the announcement of our client product RealSSD 300.
Kevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel: Can you give you an estimate of what percentage of revenue will be significant this year?
Ron Foster: Again, it gets mentioned a few times in the goal. We don’t normally forecast out that far, or I’ll tell you is that, we’re very pleased and I would say the business be ahead of our plan that we had during the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James.
Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James: I’m going back to DRAM. The transition of DDR3 and DDR2, how different is it relative to other DRAM transitions in the past that you went from DDR to DDR2 and then from DDO, I guess the DDR and so there seems to be some differences here. What are the implications through the DRAM industry?
Steve Appleton: It’s been I think, pretty normal overall from what we’ve experienced before. Obviously, the transition, it’s been upon the application and the price points are trying to target and so forth. We in terms of moving forward from here, I think it’s going to finish out so to speak, to be pretty normal process over the next year.
Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James: Then from a supply perspective, there’s no difference. It seems that a lot of supply out there may not be capable of DDR3 and could there be more shortage in that area than history would suggest?
Mark Durcan: I think you’re exactly right. Number of competitors can’t really deliver DDR3 without 50 nanometer that constrained at some of those same competitors and unlikely to be a swage tool. Some of those competitors will have difficulty participating in that market.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank.
Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank: Just a quick recap, do you mentioned demand cost reduction in the quarter was high single digits? Did I hear that right?
Mark Durcan: Yes.
Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank: Just a quick point on NAND, it’s been a couple of quarters. You’ve had pretty good pricing. RealSSD has always been a big powerful meditative for NAND. Is it encouraging you that you’ve been able to see good demand despite the price increases? Can you talk a little bit about the trade off you’re seeing in your customers between price and capacity?
Mark Durcan: The difference we’ve seen really in the applications that traditionally have consumed a lot of NAND. While the densities went up, the street pricing helped pretty much throughout the year. The normal vehicle, when you talk about, I think you really referring to retail versus distribution, the normal mechanism to enforce that as through some type of price rebate or price protection. I can tell you, across the Board and retail, they were unable to do that, use that mechanism to manage price curve. So we actually had significant demand of the higher density, but it didn’t drive pricing down. So it wasn’t very surprising to see that happen, because the applications stayed very strong. In addition to that, when you look at some new applications online, i.e. smartphones numbers of smartphones are shipping with 32 gigabits of Flash Memory, there hasn’t been an application like that in flash ever in existence. So you had a combination of some real applications of MP3 and photography in USB that have been around for while legacy applications with the growth and things like smartphones in the evolution of the introductions of SSDs, it created a pretty robust pricing environment and demand curve.
Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank: Just a real quick one, what’s your PC units working assumption right for 2010, just a would be fine?
Mark Durcan: I’m trying and quite catch that question. PC unit…?
Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank: Yes, what’s PC unit growth that the phase for 2010?
Mark Durcan: We’re hearing from customers probably somewhere in the range of anywhere from 12% to 16%.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bill Dezellem - Titan Capital Management.
Bill Dezellem - Titan Capital Management: We had a couple of questions first of all, the Inotera volumes, where we had in terms of that ramp that here only are in the call that is now fully ramped, because you don’t have vital facility charges or do you have more to go? That’s the first question and then the second question is relative to your royalties. At what point that do we see a step function increase, because if we understand correctly, when Inotera makes the transition to your technology that could be meaningful increase in those royalties?
Mark Durcan: On the piece, relative to capacity online, Inotera is essentially fully ramped at this point. Given effect that we have to have a certain amount of capacity offline to effectuate the transition to start the event, so there’s a small amount of tools that have come out place, so we can install mutual to affect the transition at 50 nanometers and that’s progressing well. Relative to the 50 nanometer transition, I think the lot Inotera comment on exactly how that’s going, other than to say, we have a pilot line up in running and we’re very satisfied with where that transition is going.  On royalties, I’ll let Ron handle the royalties.
Ron Foster: Yes, as I mentioned earlier, right now we’re getting royalties for previous technologies and you are correct as I previously communicated there is a formula for future technology rollouts and payments on a revenue basis relative that technology rollout. So it will be a function of that revenue and timing of the new technology notes in the ramp up as well as in the ramp up as well as the revenue levels, so many specific call out on that.
Bill Dezellem - Titan Capital Management: So to make sure we’re understanding or you think about this that Inotera volumes are essentially at a level they are going to be until the benefit from putting your stack technology in fab is in place, at which point there will be volume growth, they will come from that. Concurrently, that would also then lead to an increase in your royalties, but the timing of either those activities you’re going to step aside from discussing? Are we hearing all that right?
Steve Appleton: Yes. Those are currently assumptions. As we should get substantial growth from next generation technology as that rolls out and there’s a formula related to that.
Bill Dezellem - Titan Capital Management: Then a final question, can you reconcile for us the finished goods being up and yet being on allocation? I think there’s a piece of the puzzle we’re missing?
Steve Appleton: It’s pretty easy, but if you look at the increase and wafer output from Inotera related to win and then also finished goods servicing a higher shipment level to customers. I think overall inventory was only up 5% and there wasn’t substantial growth in overall FGI. So there was some growth related in Inotera, just reinforcing chipset. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley.
Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley: If I look at the DRAM costs of the percentage of PC box somewhere around 7% to 8% versus you think more normal levels of 5% to 6%. Do you think OEMs are in a position to transfer some of the costs from memory, also LCD pricing that’s kind of inflecting to the consumer if the loading keeps on going up and the price remain stable at these levels?
Mark Durcan: Yes, I think we do. I think as we just talked about earlier in the call, the 64 bit phenomenon and we looked at people who have kind of forged on a tough 2009 in terms of PC purchases across the Board in consumer and in enterprise. We think that there’s an opportunity for that. We certainly don’t see any behavior at this point of driving densities downward. In fact, we’ve seen the contrary. So at some point, we understand that dynamic would be there, but we don’t think we’re there yet.
Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley: Then a question on the supply side, there’s a perception out there that the supply is bottleneck by lithography tools? I just want to get your costs that as you guys are kind of contemplating your plans on the NAND side. Do you see any issues with you not getting the slots for the lithography tools, if you don’t make up your mind on NAND expansion right now?
Ron Foster: We I think are in a pretty good position and hence already been dialoging with the suppliers over the last number of months, if you will. So I don’t think it’s a bottleneck for say for us, I think it might be in the event those in the industry that haven’t really looked it upgrading their equipment weren’t with some issue, but I think it is general true that lithography is the longer lead time item of the all the equipment that you would have buy. I guess I could differ to the litho guys to with which to that they think their lead times are, but our experience at the moment is, that if you go in order a piece of litho equipment and the caveat I’ll give is that, we’re talking about most of started to have. If you want to go in order the most advanced step that they have, it’s probably going to be in the neighborhood of 10 months maybe 12 months. If much of that happens at all, then as just going to keep push it out from there.
Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley: For your supply goals for next year, you’re not bottlenecked anywhere?
Ron Foster: We already have our deliver side, fatherless Inotera has been in plan for the converting for sometime and so forth, so that’s all said up already.
Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley: The last one that, can you tell us, DDR3 migration to netbooks where is that, when is that?
Ron Foster: I’ll turn it over to Mark to answer, but I said one other thought real quick as if I were on the last subject. The other thing in terms were on you talk about the bottleneck. I think ordering equipment and getting as you had some lead times that I just described, but assumes if you have the money if go do it and the equipment leasing business if you will, which is how a lot of companies finance there, equipment acquisition is historically that market is completely shutdown.  When I say that, I’m talking about the GE capitals etc. I’m not essentially zero to a very little of any of that available to even companies like Micron and portion of that will go down that route, but if these companies are trying to go and get funds if which to upgrade the technology, that markets close and as you know, the other ones are pretty difficult for number on. So the whole lead time discussion is kind of move, if that will have more to go out next two phases network. Mark.
Mark Durcan: So on the netbooks convergent to DDR3, I think, by virtue of tight supply of DDR3, that will be a lagging platform if you will and these yellow side as that is, you got price point as you to round. You also have the application uses that might not warrant if where you seen the push on DDR3 in notebooks and desktop as well. So it’s bet of constrain as well as just the raw application being used for the netbook today to get a price point.
Operator: Your final question comes from Manish Goyal - CREF Investments.
Manish Goyal - CREF Investments: A couple of questions, first if DRAM price is to stay, where we are today in the second quarter, what will be the sequential increase in average DRAM prices for the quarter?
Ron Foster: We see price is up 5% quarter-to-date Manish.
Manish Goyal - CREF Investments: In the call you said, in Q1 the demand looks better than seasonal and then are you dealing the quarter? If you comment that much of the capacity that was taken off line or you did in 2009, is that a line? Do you feel stock price is slipped lower, what you’ll see from that?
Ron Foster: I’ll answer a part of that and then Mark will answer the other part if he actually heard. First of all, we didn’t say that all the capacity was back online. I said that the capacity, that which capable occurring back online. It was back online and interesting part of that is, a large part of that obviously particularly in Taiwan is on the older technology. It came back online, but it didn’t comeback online in a more advanced technology, which has historically been the cases comeback online in older technology because we’ve already to buy the equipment to upgrade.
Mark Durcan: Your question about the activity in the stock market, would you really have is two classes of product here. You could imagine when that capacity you referred to was off line. You’re a major OEM customer, looking at your supplied based in a little bit concerned about the ability for some one that tier 2 supplier to be able to service demand. So what you now have is that additional capacity come online, but not with OEMs, because OEMs can’t toggle back and forth as quick. So what you have is two tiers of OEM pricing. You’ve got your OEM contract pricing and you’ve got the spot market, low grade tier 2 DDR2 products that’s coming back on the market, which probably can’t warrant the margin and know the volume support. So companies like Micron has been add for our customers to increase our share at major OEMs. The demand is very robust. The fact that there might be some available spot market material is just byproduct of that additional demand coming back on with no real OEMs.

We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of a presentation to conform these statements to actual results.  I will now turn the call over to Mr. Ron Foster. 
Ronald C. Foster: Let me provide a brief summary of the financial results in the third quarter, which ended June 4, 2009. The results for the third quarter reflect an operating loss of $246.0 million and a net loss of $290.0 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, on net sales of $1.1 billion. Cost of goods sold was just under $1.0 billion, resulting in a gross margin of $107.0 million, or 10%. No lower cost of market write-down was recorded in the third quarter and the gross margin reflects an estimated benefit of $240.0 million from sales of products in the third quarter that were subject to previous write-downs. Cost of goods sold in the third quarter also includes approximately $30.0 million of charges from Inotera and IM Flash Singapore for the cost of idle capacity. Total sales in the third quarter increased 11% compared to the second quarter as a result of higher sales of both memory and imaging products. Memory sales also include royalties and technology fees of $32.0 million. DRAM sales increased 14% compared to the second quarter to $553.0 million, primarily due to an 18% increase in bit shipments. NAND sales were flat compared to the second quarter at $426.0 million as a 20% increase in bit sales was offset by a decline in the NAND average selling price compared to the second quarter. Imaging revenue was $127.0 million in the third quarter, a 53% increase compared to the previous quarter. This signals that we may have seen a bottoming out of demand in the mobile markets, combined with some seasonal effects. Looking at NAND in more detail now, the average selling price in the third quarter decreased approximately 17% compared to the second quarter. However, trade ASPs on sales to customers, other than Intel, were up about 13%, while the ASP for products sold to Intel from IM Flash, which are on a cost basis, declined markedly with a successful ramp of our 34 nanometer [nm] technology products. Notably, trade ASPs on component sales increased significantly more than the 13% for all non-Intel trade customers. Mark will elaborate on this is a few minutes. This new 34nm technology node correspondingly drove down our overall NAND bit cost by 35%, well ahead of our prior projections. These cost declines exclude the effects of lower cost or market write-downs and their flow-through benefits, as well as the cost of the idle facilities of IM Flash Singapore. The conversion to the 34nm NAND process is now complete for all wafer starts, which is providing us the lowest bit cost in the industry and has placed the entire NAND business in positive gross margin territory in the third quarter. Q4 NAND cost reductions are expected to be in the high single digits and bit production is forecast to increase in the mid-teens range. On the DRAM side, DRAM average selling price in the third quarter was relatively flat compared to the second quarter. Pricing for core products, as well as specialty DRAM products, each increase in the third quarter. However, the increase in bit shipments of DRAM products came primarily in core products, which continue to shift in mix away from specialty DRAM products that generally command a higher per bit selling price. This shift in mix offset ASP increases in the quarter. DRAM production costs, excluding the effects of the lower cost or market write-downs and idle facility charges, decreased 11% compared to the second quarter. The lower production costs were primarily due to ongoing improvements in manufacturing efficiencies, including cost reductions and technology migrations. You recall that Inotera has significantly reduced its production following Qimonda's default under its wafer purchase commitment. This triggered charges for idle capacity to Micron under the wafer supply agreement. To date, Inotera has not produced any products for Micron, however, we expect to begin taking some volumes in Q4. Micron will evaluate the volume of purchases from Inotera on a monthly basis. We anticipate only ordering products when the purchase and subsequent resale are expected to be cash-flow positive compared to the idle facility charge. Fiscal Q4 DRAM cost reductions are expected to be in the low teens and bit production is forecast to increase in the mid-to-high-teens range. These projections exclude charges associated with idle capacity at Inotera but include any product that Micron receives from Inotera. Turning now to operating expenses, we continue efforts to scale down operating costs as reflected in the aggressive reduction in SG&A costs, which were $80.0 million in the third quarter. Staffing levels and SG&A areas have decreased 11% from their high early in the fiscal year and they are continuing to decrease. R&D costs in the third quarter of $162.0 million were lower than previous guidance as some new products, particularly NAND products, were transferred out of development and into production in advance of the original plan. We anticipate SG&A expense in the fourth quarter to be in the $75.0 million to $80.0 million and R&D expenses to be in the $140.0 million to $150.0 million range. Reductions are primarily driven by the carve out of Aptina, which is expected to occur a third of the way through our fourth quarter. Other operating expense in the third quarter includes an estimated $53.0 million loss on disposal of Aptina and a $28.0 million of losses from changes in currency exchange rates as the U.S. dollar weakened substantially during the third quarter. Relating to the third quarter results from our joint ventures, the loss from equity method investments reflects our share of Inotera's net loss. The non-controlling interest in net loss line primarily reflects the allocation of tax loss to the minority shareholders. Turning now to the balance sheet, the third quarter ended with $1.3 billion of cash, which includes approximately $475.0 million in net proceeds from our convertible debt and equity offering completed in the quarter.  The increase in the reported balance of inventories at the end of the third quarter is principally due to the effect of the inventory write-down at the end of the second quarter. Inventory balances, excluding the estimated effect of write-downs, decreased 8% in the third quarter compared to Q2. Cash flow from operating activities in the third quarter continued to remain positive at $151.0 million, well ahead of competition. The debt to capital ratio, both before and after the issuance during the quarter of the convertible notes and common shares, remained around the 30% range, consistent with our long-term capital structure target and also significantly better than most of our competitors. Capital expenditures during the third quarter were $93.0 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $566.0 million. We estimate capital expenditures in Q4 of roughly $100.0 million. For fiscal 2010 capital expenditures are expected to be in a range similar to 2009. This range can vary based upon market conditions as we go forward. With respect to our joint ventures, in the third quarter we made a capital contribution of approximately $100.0 million to continue the 15nm conversion at TECH Semiconductor, which was financed through loan proceeds. In addition, the third quarter had distributions to JB Partners of approximately $125.0 million, consisting primarily of payments from IM Flash to Intel. As previously announced, we signed an agreement to sell a majority interest in our imaging solutions business, Aptina Imaging Corporation, to Riverwood Capital and TPG Capital. As part of the agreement, Micron will retain a 35% minority stake after the partners contribute significant debt-free capital to the independent privately held company. The transaction is expected to close around the first part of July. Partially due to operating losses in recent periods and changes in the balance sheet occurring in the normal course of business, we now estimate the loss associated with the sale of the majority interest in the imaging business to be approximately $53.0 million. Since we now treat Aptina as held for sale, we are required to recognize this estimated loss in fiscal Q3 in advance of the transaction's closing in Q4. After the close of the sale, the financial position and results of operations of Aptina will no longer be consolidated in Micron's financial statements and we will have equity method accounting for the ongoing investment. Micron will continue to manufacture products and provide services for Aptina through supply and service agreements at its worldwide facilities. And with that, I will close here and turn the commentary over to Mark Adams.
Mark W. Adams: We experienced a strong increase in bit shipments in both our DRAM and NAND businesses during our third quarter. The bit increase was driven by stronger than anticipated demand across many of our key market segments. Given the performance, we continue to grow share with DRAM and NAND markets. The [inaudible] environment was more stable in Q3 when compared to our prior two quarters and thus we are more optimistic about the overall memory sector heading into the back half of calendar 2009.  Our overall DRAM shipments grew 18% in bits shipped quarter-over-quarter. As market forecast suggests bit demand in personal computing to be up in the low-to-mid teens, we continue to grow share from competition in this segment. Service bits shipped in our third quarter increased 31%. Additionally, we have seen some strong upside forecast in our service base which we anticipate will bode well for us in fiscal Q4. In Q3 we saw a shift in demand towards DDR3 memory for both server and PC applications. Bit shipment of DDR3 product increased approximately 70% quarter-over-quarter and represented about 25% of our overall core DRAM sales. Micron's technology and cost leadership in DDR3 puts us in a unique position to capitalize on the growth and demand coming from both PC- and server-related customers. Due primarily to some new customer wins, our networking shipments were up quarter-over-quarter as well. As large corporations and governments continue to invest in infrastructure, we see the enterprise networking segment as a growth opportunity for our specialty business through 2009 and into 2010. The mobile business saw a decline in bit shipments quarter-over-quarter, down 12%. While the overall handset market continues to be challenged, Micron saw strong growth in shipments of our MTPs multi-ship packages where we experienced a 35% increase from previous quarter bit shipments. We continue to feel Micron is in a unique position to grow our bit shipments into smart phone segment, which is projected to grow 15% year-over-year. Micron has a broad portfolio of products in [inaudible] specifically as a segment, including MTPs, CSRAM products, EMN and NAND-based technology, and mobile memory cards. As Ron mentioned, due to a mixed shift in our business, our overall DRAM pricing was relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. That notwithstanding, PC-related DDR2 pricing saw an increase in our fiscal Q3. In addition, we saw a strong increase in DDR3 pricing towards the end of our quarter, driven by a surge in DDR3 demand. It is important to note that as of today, Micron is one of only a few suppliers of DDR3 memory. We are leading in DDR3 technology development with 1GB and 2GB products based on our 15nm process. In the third quarter our NAND shipments were up 21% from the previous quarter due to stronger than expected demand from the mobile, USB, mp3, photo, and FT markets. This quarter we shipped in excess of 90% of our MLC products based on our industry leading 34nm technology. The 34nm conversion is now completed and we believe this technology gives Micron a sizeable cost advantage versus our competition. Our retail business, which includes our industry-leading e-commerce site, Crucial.com, made strong contributions of Micron's overall operating performance. We had a number of significant wins in the retail channel with Lexar and Crucial branded products.  We continue to gain global market share growth leveraging Micron's NAND technology and a strong brand portfolio in the consumer markets we serve. Shrink component compression for NAND was up significantly in the quarter. As the industry continues to migrate to higher density chips, we feel bit consumption will continue to grow and the demand market will be in fairly balanced supply and demand position throughout our fourth quarter. We remain optimistic that the market segments, such as FSDs, notebooks and NANDs for mobile phones will continue to drive strong bit consumption. Overall we were very pleased with our NAND performance in Q3. As we suggested in our last call, the environment in both DRAM and NAND did in fact improve in Q3. We remain hopeful that almost two years of capital expenditure cut-backs and a reduction of supply in the industry will improve the profit potential for Micron. We feel Q3 was a good step in that direction. With that, I will hand it back over to Kipp.
Kipp A. Bedard: We will now take questions from callers. (Instructions)
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Co.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Co.: It seems like the biggest variable in my model for you in fiscal Q3 was NAND pricing. What is the expectation in the August quarter for Q4 in terms of NAND ASP per bit?
Steven R. Appleton: Right now, in the market today, we expect to be kind of flat to mildly up in the quarter until we see what some of our customers and all look like going into the holiday season, which normally we get a good sense of in August.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Co.: I guess my question is, you know, this is just guess work here, but if you're rolling off of Intel heavy Q3 and maybe lightening a little bit up in terms of the mix in terms of Intel in Q4, does that effect have any impact on our assumptions for ASP per bit in Q4?
Steven R. Appleton: I'm not sure the assumption that we're rolling off Intel in Q4 is correct. It's basically a flat stick. That doesn't change quarter-over-quarter.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Co.: So the Intel content in your NAND Flash business is basically roughly flat quarter-over-quarter as a percentage of the mix?
Steven R. Appleton: On a volume base, that's right.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Co.: And I just kind of look at the royalty business, I think with Nanya projected to start kicking in sometime I guess next year in terms of their production, I was just wondering how should we be modeling basically, or thinking about that royalty and licensing revenue stream in 2010? Should we expect R&D kind of sharing part of that revenue stream to start declining or does that start picking up because of the units coming out of Nanya in 2010? What's the directionality and what's the magnitude of that in 2010.
Ronald C. Foster: We have got some technology agreements that are already in place and that's showing in the revenue numbers that I mentioned were at $32.0 million this quarter, roughly the same last quarter. And that continues forward.  Then also, as you point out, when volume picks up with product volumes out of Inotera, there will be licensing royalties associated with that capacity as well. At typical market rates, you might say. We haven't specifically called it out.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Co.: Just in terms of your capex spend in 2010 being flat with 2009, what are some of the assumptions that you have for production for DRAM and NAND?
D. Mark Durcan: For DRAM bit production I think we would expect to see bits up in the mid-to-high teens in the first quarter. And NAND bit growth in the mid-teens.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Co.: How about fiscal 2010 on that?
D. Mark Durcan: Longer term, I think the NAND bit growth will depend a little bit on our QX node migration as we intend to start late in the third quarter or in the calendar fourth quarter of 2009. But overall I think you could look for something in the 10% range quarter-over-quarter, in line with the normal shrink path for the NAND on a go-forward basis. For DRAM, a lot of it is going to depend on the timing of the Inotera ramp, and as you know, we are bringing that capacity online now. If the market grows 40% next year we will be well in excess of that.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tim Luke - Barclays Capital.
Tim Luke - Barclays Capital: If your ASP[?] were to remain stable from here, what should we be assuming with respect to DRAM for the fourth fiscal quarter?
Steven R. Appleton: Quarter-to-date we've got DRAM ASP pretty flat and quarter-to-date we have the trade portion of our NAND business down about 5%.
Tim Luke - Barclays Capital: And could you talk a little bit about how you perceive the licensing opportunity associated with the coming fiscal year, particularly as Nanya may increase production. And could you also just remind us of the framework for what we should be thinking about in terms of minority interest loss levels associated with Aptina or what that might have been in the fiscal third quarter?
Ronald C. Foster: In terms of the licensing, sort of as I mentioned earlier, we've got ongoing technology agreements that will be roughly at the level we've seen and there will be, as I said, typical royalty levels paid on incremental volumes where our technology, our stack technology is being applied in Inotera. We haven't called out those specifics but there will be some expansion of that in the future as the stack technology gets adopted in Inotera, which is, as Mark mentioned, is scheduled out in the coming quarters. In terms of Aptina loss levels, that of course depends on their financial performance on their P&L going forward and so we can't exactly call out what that would look like or our share of it, but we would be taking a 35% share of whatever that financial result would be on a quarter-by-quarter basis, with a slight lag effect on the timing.
Steven R. Appleton: Let me jump in while we're talking about Inotera. You know, I think it's fair to say that we view Inotera as historically one of the most efficient and forward-looking, probably the most efficient, DRAM manufacturers. They do a lot of 50nm technologies. So when I talk about bit growth here just a minute ago, there is bit growth obviously associated with the volume coming back on line, but I think with a lot of our 50nm technology, moving into calendar 2010, we think that they're going to be a very, very focused and very efficient producer, leading the industry from a cost perspective.
Tim Luke - Barclays Capital: If I may also, you talked about your capex being flat for the coming fiscal year. Could you just remind us what level that is off and could you just outline, as you move forward, what you guess to see to be the key variables now in terms of improving the gross margin dynamics from here.
Ronald C. Foster: In terms of the capex, it's the level similar to 2010 which was $650.0 million to $700.0 million kind of range, is what I was taking that at and that's based upon our current assumptions relative to our expansion plans. But I will turn it over to Mark, who can elaborate a little bit on our sort of thinking of our competitive position vis-à-vis our capex investments.
D. Mark Durcan: First of all, let me say on the capex that we plan going forward, it's a relatively small number we believe, primarily because we've been pretty thoughtful about how we deploy the capital as we rolled off what is a pretty efficient new 300mm capacity. And I will give you a couple of examples. As we rolled out 300mm capacity it all came out with Damascene copper processing so we don't have that home in front of us as we move to advance shrink geometries. We also deployed NAND technology at 300mm for large expandable, with double patterning toward we need to apply well below 34nm now. So we are well down the path in terms of having all the tooling in place and that's why you see a relatively low maintenance capital spend for Micron on a go-forward basis. Obviously if there are significant changes in the marketplace we will take a look at whether or not there are additional things we want to do from a capex perspective. But we think we are in great shape to continue advancing our technology and driving down costs with a relatively small capex spend. On a gross margin, relative to the gross margin question you asked, we feel very good about our road map on a go-forward basis. You really haven't seen much of the impact yet from our 50nm DRAM. In fact, that's all in front of us on a go-forward basis on the DRAM side. There is still some follow through as we look to fiscal Q4. In fact, from the 34nm ramp is now complete and as I mentioned earlier, we are well positioned to roll on into our QX nanometer NAND mode. So we think we are in a good position. Keep driving costs down, we've demonstrated some good success here over the last three or four quarters and we don't plan to change anything relative.
Ronald C. Foster: I was just going to add that the NAND gross margins I mentioned in a positive territory, even excluding the effects of inventory write-down carry through, we're still in positive territory in NAND margin and it's on an operating basis for the first time. So a significant accomplishment and as Mark mentioned, I think there will be more to come as we continue out our 34nm ramp and right on the heels of that will be the 2Xnm technology.
Operator: Your next question comes from Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan.
Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: What was your bits production sequentially in NAND and DRAM?
Steven R. Appleton: We saw DRAM up mid-teens, and we saw NAND production bit growth up over 30%, quarter-to-quarter.
Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: And then you said your cost reduction was down 35% sequentially in NAND, is that correct?
Ronald C. Foster: Correct.
Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: And does that track precisely with what you sent to Intel in terms of pricing per bit? So your Intel pricing was down 35 as well?
Ronald C. Foster: It's approximately the same formula. It's on a cost basis, so yes, that's essentially correct, although there are some minor variations based upon timing.
Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: So I think that one of the things I'm struggling with is when we observe the spot pricing and even the spot pricing market, they would suggest that you would have had better DRAM pricing and better external NAND pricing. Can you help us understand why there is a difference there?
D. Mark Durcan: The issue that's really driving that is some of our specialty markets have lagged in terms of demand and that's had a little bit more price pressure in the current quarter. And when the core commodity markets, both in DRAM and NAND, rebound, those prices lag and the demand is starting to pick up. We have seen some favorable uptick, as I said earlier, on the server market, for example. While it wasn't strong throughout the early part of the quarter, the last month of the quarter was very strong. We're seeing good demand going into the back half. So a lot of it has to do with mix, as we look at that. And then our 32GB bit part on the NAND side was out of the market earlier through some customers trials and what have you and we just started to get that established in the marketplace and we started to see a better take on the demand in pricing there.
Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: As far as what your PC OEM customers and maybe even your consumer electronics customers are saying for calendar Q3, what kind of bit shipments are they guiding you for in terms of DRAM consumption on the PC side?
Steven R. Appleton: What we're seeing on the DRAM side is somewhere in the mid-teens and the NAND side, slightly lower than that.
Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: In terms of demand for calendar Q3?
Steven R. Appleton: Yes.
Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: How about the channel inventories? Can you give us an update there on both the DRAM and NAND side?
Steven R. Appleton: Yes, sure. I've read a lot about people suggesting that the first half of the year was a lot of inventory replenishing the channel. We're not seeing that. We're actually seeing fairly robust demand, albeit at pricing in DRAM, which we like to do higher. But we're not seeing an inventory build-up in the channel.  I think people primarily—I said this in the last call and I still believe it—I think people in this current economy are so focused on the cash flow operations of their business that they are not allowing themselves to take these inventory positions that are above and beyond what they can manage.
Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: And then, what did your wafer production do sequentially?
D. Mark Durcan: It was up a couple percent.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Pitzer - Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: If DRAM pricing were to stay flat from these levels, what would be the expected under-utilization charge you might have in the fiscal fourth quarter relative to Inotera?
Steven R. Appleton: I didn't quite hear all that question. Could you repeat that for me, please?
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: If DRAM pricing were to remain flat from current levels, what would be the expected under-utilization charge in the quarter for the Inotera JV?
Ronald C. Foster: The Inotera charge is an idle capacity charge. It doesn't have anything to do with pricing, so if we are not utilizing the capacity, then there is a charge that comes through related to that. But it's not related to pricing in the market per se.  Now if you're asking what happens if we do or don't take wafer volume, as I mentioned, that will be predicated on whether we have incremental profit contribution that we get out of taking the wafer supply, in the near term, out of Inotera vis-à-vis the idle capacity charges.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: I guess that's my question. Are we at a price level in DRAM where we would expect those idle charges to decrease, stay flat, or go up quarter-on-quarter?
Ronald C. Foster: The way I would say it is, right now we view we're in a place where we can take supply of their trench capacity and make incremental contribution out of it at current pricing. That's why we're taking volume, but we will make decisions on a monthly basis whether to start wafers based upon our view of the economics going forward.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: And then getting back to the capex being flat going into fiscal 2010, can you give me a sense of how much of that is going to DRAM versus NAND and is any of that going to Inotera to help transition from trench to start, or are they beholden to support themselves on their own capex needed to do that transition?
D. Mark Durcan: It's slightly more DRAM than NAND and I don't have the numbers in front of me but probably roughly 65 DRAM, 35 NAND, something on that order. And relative to Inotera, there's nothing in that capex number to support Inotera. Our view is that we will be able to have a successful financing figure, their capital independently.
Steven R. Appleton: And to be clear, we have a minority equity interest in Inotera so it would not show as consolidated capex for us anyway, it will be some kind of capital contribution that would be required if that were to happen, which is not at all contemplated at this time. Inotera is planning to take care of their own technology transition through their own financing.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: You commented in the prepared comments that enterprise demand was looking better going into the calendar third quarter. I'm wondering if you could elaborate on that a little bit. Is that just all based upon the demand you're seeing here on DDR3 for servers? Are you seeing a pick-up in corporate PCs as well, or what's giving you confidence that enterprise is upticking here?
Mark W. Adams: The networking sector for us is more on the networking server and [inaudible] equipment that we are seeing some uptick on. We've had some new customer wins. Primarily a lot of this is over in the Asia market. And for us, my comments were really around our business in our growth net segment versus the overall industry's direction.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Relative to your views of the soap opera that is the DRAM industry around consolidation, we've gone through another quarter now with rumors, speculations, and some hard facts around Aptina and TMC and I'm just kind of curious as things sit now how you view the consolidation in the industry relative to more players being shaken out, or if you could give me a sense of from peak production in Q3 of last year to where you think things finally shake out, how much capacity do you think will permanently exit the industry?
Steven R. Appleton: It's difficult to know at any given moment where it stands. My perspective is that it's stalled here for a little bit, that effectively Qimonda is factually being liquidated and there is no return of that. And that the DRAM pricing is such that on the margin, I think, some of the Taiwanese are making a bet that it's going to get better but at the current level it's not helpful for them. Maybe equally important is to look at the debt structure that they're trying to deal with and it probably gives you a little more insight into what are the real alternatives that they have moving forward. I think that the probabilities of them going out and doing anything in terms of new capacity is essentially zero. The probabilities of them actually even really being able to upgrade much of their current capacity is pretty low. And they're all struggling with trying to deal on how to deal with the debt. And by the way, that's also something that we have to encounter in the event that we have any kind of consolidation discussions with any of those players. So when you look at the debt repayment structures, they are pretty heavy in the next twelve months. That's where Micron also is advantaged because as Mark Durcan already described, we have spent a lot of money, we're in a pretty good position, we don't have to spend much more money to advance our cost structure.  But these guys do. And they don't really have it so their cost structure is getting much less competitive. There is lots of speculation as to what will happen. You know, it's really, at the end of the day, there are three major facilities that exist in Taiwan. It's the Inotera facility, which I would say you heard about [inaudible] facility which is state-of-the-art and it will be low cost. And then the facility, there's the benchmark facility. Then you have Promos, which probably again, just anecdotally from what I've heard in the industry, had their output number down in the 80% range, so you have a facility that could produce, you know, call it 100k a month and it was producing something closer to 20 and you know, maybe it's inched its way back up to 30 or thereabouts, I've understood. So it's still way, way under-utilized. But that capacity is aging at actually a pretty rapid rate now because it's just getting less and less cost effective. And then the other big producer, of course, is Power Chip. And you will probably continue about the saga between Power Chip and LPN, Rexchip and so forth, but what Power Chip had also, I think, cut their production down in the 80% range, but then they are probably closer back up to 40% of 50% of the capacity now, trying to figure out where this market is going. And Rexchip, by the way, never did cut its capacity that much and neither did LPN, neither did Micron. So the output numbers are relatively stable.  In aggregate, the total capacity that came off line we think was in the mid-30% or 35% of the lower capacity per diem, came off line. You can do the math yourself, but essentially maybe 5% of that is thinking about making a throw back on the line. You could even argue as high as 10%, with what Inotera, Power Chip, and Promos have all been in combination. But it's not a lot. And even from our perspective on what's going on with the Inotera capacity, the pricing has to get a lot better than it is now to provide much incentive for a whole lot of this capacity to come back online. Until it gets converted or until the pricing gets a lot higher, we're obviously got our own plans on Inotera. But you know, there's just no dollars involved for anything else to do and so we think that there's not a lot capacity to come back on line here. And actually we don't think at the current pricing, there's only a couple of us where the structure looks pretty good. So I don't think it's really been [inaudible] at this level.
Operator: Your next question comes from James Covello - Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: Just to clarify one follow-up from the answer there. You said 5% or 10% of that capacity could come back on line. Is that 5% or 10% of total industry capacity or 5% or 10% of what was taken off line in the first place.
Steven R. Appleton: Well, no, it's 5% to 10% of the total industry capacity.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: What are you seeing in terms of trends in content per box?
Steven R. Appleton: On the PC side it's relatively flat through Q3. The net book impact in the overall PC segment had a modest negative hit on it but it's modest and so it's relatively flat, up until today. And we see better things down the road as Windows 7K gets out in the marketplace.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: And could you just comment on that for a second relative to Windows 7. I know there is some concern from people that there is going to be destacking around Windows 7 because you don't need as much content to run it. But you obviously have different thoughts on that?
Steven R. Appleton: We do think there is an upside from an application perspective as more of these applications come online and get over to the Windows 7 platform. So when you look at some of the third-party analysts who are looking at this, they are thinking the same thing, that content per box will continue to go up, probably through the holidays, assuming how things go in October. Things go well through the holidays and through 2010 and so we're pretty positive on that.
Operator: Your next question comes from Uche Orji – UBS.
Uche Orji - UBS: Let me just go back to the answer you gave about [inaudible] inventory and you said that it's going to be a level inventory. What is the rate mix of how many weeks of inventory held in the channel and held by your customers?
Steven R. Appleton: If we understood the question, it was about memory in the channel, is that correct?
Uche Orji - UBS: That is correct. How can we quantify, if you could tell me how much of the inventory, in terms of weeks, and if you can just compare that with what is it historically. Just for me to be able to quantify the answer that there wasn't much channel inventory.
Steven R. Appleton: We don't normally release that information because a lot of customers prepared the information that we have that we have been using on our own internal data. But as I said earlier, we don't see any abnormal from kind of current state and what we expect in the channel. We haven't seen any inventory build up. We are kind of reluctant to give data that is customer-related to answer that type of question.
Uche Orji - UBS: In terms of NAND, what are you seeing in terms of—can you just give us any update as to what your developments are on that [inaudible] for NAND.
D. Mark Durcan: So obviously as with all participants in the NAND space, we have active programs and [inaudible] on other. We will have 34nm for competitive reasons right now in the marketplace, late this calendar year.
Uche Orji - UBS: Later this calendar year.
D. Mark Durcan: Yes.
Uche Orji - UBS: Would that be volume or would that just be for the [inaudible]?
D. Mark Durcan: Well, it's not going to be a huge piece of the volume because we don't see that it really addresses a large piece of the market. So I don't think you should think of it as [inaudible], in this time frame at least, to see what's the impact on [inaudible].
Steven R. Appleton: And to follow-up on that, when you look at where we're selling our NAND application, there is not a lot of it will take to [inaudible] in the near term, so our application base, our customers [inaudible] as well as our OEM customers, we don't think there is a utilization at a value premium to the current technology we have.
Uche Orji - UBS: And just in terms of the Inotera, what is the migration pattern then for Inotera? When should we expect 50nm production to start to ramp based on the plans you have? And just financially, what kind of funding requirements do you think Inotera would need to be sure that they can meet the other part of the funding as you migrate the stock.
D. Mark Durcan: Let me take the first bit and then maybe Ron can talk to the financing. On the technology deployment, we have equipment on order now to support the introduction of 50nm technology. We will see first silicon out late in the calendar year. But you should expect volume of a significant amount in late calendar Q1, early calendar Q2.
Ronald C. Foster: In terms of the financial funding, as mentioned earlier there, they're a separate public company focused on doing their own financing, so we worked with them to develop the view on what the capital requirements are as they integrate that with their total business view and have communicated numbers, but be aware that they're really numbers owned by Inotera and they view, and we concur, that they can scale the build up of their capacity over time and scale the capex investments relative to the market need, their customer requirements, including Micron, etc. So the way to think about it is that they've communicated that there can be a phase in the $700.0 million to $800.0 million kind of range and then up into a full conversion cost, depending upon the timing they want to do that, it would be around $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion. But that's numbers coming from Inotera.
Uche Orji - UBS: And lastly, on DDR3, what should we model as a percentage of DDR3 exiting calendar 2009? And then also, what kind of premium do you get on DDR3 over DDR2 and when do you think we will achieve a cross over between DDR3 and DDR2 in terms of production.
Steven R. Appleton: We didn’t quite hear the first part of what you were interested in modeling.
Uche Orji - UBS: In terms of how much DDR3 as a percentage of production we should model for exiting calendar 2009.
Mark W. Adams: I think as we exit calendar 2009, I think you would expect that at the core DRAM business DDR3 would represent less than 50% of the outlook.
Uche Orji - UBS: And then in terms of the DDR3 over DDR2 premium, what is it now? Is there any price premium at the moment with DDR3 over DDR2 and what is that.
Steven R. Appleton: That premium, as I said in the earlier comments, towards the end of our quarter, is up in the 15% to 20% range.
Operator: Your next question comes from Hans Mosesmann – Raymond James.
Hans Mosesmann – Raymond James: Going back to the 30% of the global capacity that was taken off line earlier this year and some of it that may be coming back, how much of that capacity is DDR3 capable or viable?
Steven R. Appleton: Of the capacity coming back on line, almost zero probably. 
Hans Mosesmann – Raymond James: I'm sorry, that was zero?
Steven R. Appleton: Yes, essentially zero.  I just have some commentary. I think one thing that has occurred that we're thinking about is in particular, you know most of the time DDR3 design on the current, or now what I would consider to be year-old process technology. I think [inaudible] maybe spending money and going to the next mode. And since that hasn't happened, we don't really have DRAM treatments. First of all, it wouldn't be very cost effective or it might not even be fitting in the form factor for the applications given the current technologies. So I think that's one of the reasons that's the case I stated almost zero coming back.
Hans Mosesmann – Raymond James: And as a follow-up, how much would it cost them to come up with a design, just for kicks?
Steven R. Appleton: I don't think the cost of a design is really all that significant. I think it's the ability to get to the next process node to produce it on that's where you need the money.
Operator: Your next question comes from Analyst for Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA.
Analyst for Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA: I just have a question on your cash usage, other than capital expenditure, how do you plan to use your cash on hand going forward?
Steven R. Appleton: Other than capex, obviously the big cash use we have here is capex over time. But if you've noted from our quarter-over-quarter, some of the commentaries from Ron and Mark were operationally we're in pretty good position on cash. So I think we're first and foremost going to protect the balance sheet and protect the forward financial shape the company is in.  But then I think what it does allow us to do, as we noted earlier when we were raising additional money, is just be prepared for other opportunities to come along, you know in the event we wanted to take advantage of them. And that doesn't necessarily mean, by the way, that we're going to go out and spend a bunch of cash on acquisitions, but in the event that we participate in M&A activity, and we become larger, then obviously we would desire to have a larger cash position with which to operate a larger company. So I think that's how we're looking at it today.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank Securities.
Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank Securities: Just curious if you've kind of adjusted your loadings between DRAM and NAND for the back half. Any big changes there, any preference for one or the other?
D. Mark Durcan: We haven't done anything of significance. There's always a little fine tuning going on.
Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank Securities: Within the NAND market, have you seen anything in particular in terms of the different markets you may sell into, particularly maybe spots versus OEM versus kind of retail. Is there any one area that's particularly strong or are they all pretty coincidental?
Steven R. Appleton: I think the OEM market started to pick up a little bit as people start to position for the holiday, not knowing what the market will be like. You've seen some price fluctuation over the last 90 to 120 days in NAND and I'm not sure that the market quite understands what pricing will be as people start to build in supplies for their Christmas build. So I think the OEM market seems a little bit strong. The spot market right now is sitting, watching that and waiting to see. I think we commented earlier that the market is down about 5% quarter-to-date, and that's primarily driven by the stock market. The retail sector is kind of so-so right now. It's not great and it's also going into a seemingly quiet period, the end of June, early July, before back-to-school starts.  So that's kind of the landscape right now in NAND, heading into the back half of the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley.
Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley: Nice job on the margins, especially for NAND. So I'm kind of surprised that your capex for next year is going to be more skewed toward DRAM. I would expect Inotera to take most of that burden. And so the question is how do you sustain your leadership in NAND cost if [inaudible] is going to be minimum? And what is the next milestone for Micron, beyond 34nm?
D. Mark Durcan: On a per wafer basis, if you think about the technology transition that has to occur, we need essentially to convert all of techs at the end of the year so that's why there's a slightly larger burden there as well as MTV being split 50/50. When you look at NAND, why is that bill so low? Well the bill is so low by design. When we roll out, in fact it's okay to say now, when we rolled out 50nm NAND we even contemplated our strategy through 34nm and 2Xnm, doing a double-pattern strategy, and put those tools in place. So rather than having a lot of re-tooling at this stage, we will have a relatively small amount of re-tooling to do as we transition to the 2Xnm late this year. And that's the short story. Relative to 3 bit per [inaudible], whatever, there's really not much capex associated with that at all.
Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley: Let's follow-up on the Aptina, after you sell the majority stake how should we think about the normalized revenue rate from this business and normalized opex rate?
Steven R. Appleton: First of all, as Ron noted, we're going to continue to make the wafers. So I think the way to think about it is the additional margin that occurred from the wafer making its way into the marketplace will now be picked up by Aptina and we will account for that on an equity method basis. But in terms of the revenue sale of the wafers, that will continue on as it has.
Operator: Your next question comes from Analyst for Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird.
Analyst for Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird: What was the break down between core and special PC RAM?
Steven R. Appleton: Is that a percent of revenue?
Analyst for Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird: Yes.
Steven R. Appleton: Core DRAM was in the area of 30%, more or less. And [inaudible] DRAM was around 17% or 18%.
Analyst for Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird: And you were talking a little bit about how you NAND patterning, you don't need new equipment, a lot of new equipment for that. Is that why the DRAM capex is high, is that you do need new equipment for the 50nm node and how long do you think that that equipment can last. Can that last a couple of transitions or is that going to be need to be replaced in one to two transitions?
D. Mark Durcan: I didn't mean to leave you with the impression there was no capex for NAND. There is a split because of demand. Yes, for DRAM, there is a pharmacy[?] capex required. There is also some pharmacy[?] capex required on the NAND side and at this point, the way we staged our capex, we're buying essentially end-of-the-road-map tools. So as we buy pharmacy[?] tools, they really are 1.35 on the emerging scanners and there's nothing beyond that to purchase at this time.
Analyst for Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird: You talked a little bit about kind of guidance relative to what you're going to be without Aptina. Do you have what the opex number for Aptina was this quarter?
Steven R. Appleton: If you look at the data that Ron had referenced earlier, in fact I let Ron comment on it.
Ronald C. Foster: If you look at our typical imaging segment, which as Steve already mentioned, will be parsed into what's remaining as we go forward, most of the opex will go away in the new construct. We will still have some amount of R&D and SG&A but relatively small percentage of the total that's there. And rough numbers, we will run around $30.0+ million in R&D and $9.0 million or so in SG&A on the total imaging segment. So we dropped to relatively small numbers on both of those scores. And as Steve mentioned, the product will be shipped on a foundry basis, so in general we would expect to have gross margins that will be a little bit lighter and the opex is significantly lighter in the new model.
Analyst for Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird: And so we should expect an additional $10.0 million drop off in the November quarter to the year modeling for one month of opex in the August quarter? Is that how we should think about it?
Ronald C. Foster: No. We're contemplating closing around early July and so we have two months of the effect in our fiscal fourth quarter. And we only have an additional month of the effect in the subsequent fiscal first quarter. We have two-thirds of the effect already in the guidance I gave you for Q4.
Analyst for Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird: Are you currently producing both DDR2 and DDR3 above cash cost right now? And given the strong shift to DDR3 in the market, what are your expectations for DDR2 pricing for the rest of this year?
Steven R. Appleton: The answer to the first part of the question cash flow-wise is yes. And as you probably know, historically we don't try and predict the ASPs on the outward quarters. We'll leave that to you guys.
Analyst for Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird: What do you expect for the industry, then? You're talking about 50% of your core DRAM is going to be DDR3 exiting this year. What do you think the industry will do on that front? And what percent of current capacity out there do you think is capable of producing DDR3?
D. Mark Durcan: Just to clarify one thing. We will be 50% of our core by our fiscal year end. We think the market looks like, if you're looking at third-party data, will probably be in the 25% to 30% range at the end of the calendar year. We have a significant advantage technologically against all of our competitors in the DDR3 market, so we have led that. As a rough guess, you've probably got a couple of competitors and their capacity that can actually make a solid 50nm DDR3 product out there. To Steve's comments earlier, there is a substantial amount of current DRAM capacity that has not been brought forward and will cost a substantial amount of money for them to get into that DDR3 market.
Analyst for Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird: On the 50nm and the 2Xnm for the DRAM and NAND, if I am looking at two equivalent wafers, assuming 100% yield, what's the bit growth that is just from going from a 34nm to the 2Xnm or the 68nm to the 50nm?
Steven R. Appleton: I think I'm just going to keep that one in our pocket for now. The 50nm data is actually publicly available. You can get a die size on a 50nm but I think I'll just save publishing that to anyone else who's listening in on the call. And we're not talking about the die size on our 2Xnm yet.

Ron.
Ronald C. Foster :  Thanks Kipp. I will briefly review the summary financial results for the second quarter, which ended March 5, 2009. Revenue for the second quarter decreased 29% compared to the prior quarter. Memory revenues were down 26%, due to an unusually steep memory ASP decline of 20%, driven by overall market weakness. Memory revenues included $33 million in royalty and technology fees. Imaging revenues were down 53% from quarter-to-quarter, primarily due to weakness in the mobile phone market.  We ended the second quarter with $932 million in cash and short term investments. Operating cash flow was $339 million in the second quarter, including a one time benefit of $208 million related to a billing to Intel for the termination of the Boise supply agreement. Financing cash flows for the quarter included $208 million distribution to Intel for their share of the supply agreement.  Gross margin was minus 27% for the quarter. The declines in memory ASPs during the quarter triggered a $234 million non-cash write-down of memory inventories to estimated market value. Also included in these results is a favorable NRV flow through effect from prior period write-offs of $277 million. Absent the NRV effects in both quarters, memory gross margin was 11% lower quarter-to-quarter. Idle facility charges of approximately $60 million at Inotera and IM Flash Singapore are included in the quarter results. We anticipate that idle facility costs will be somewhat lower in fiscal Q3. NAND average selling prices declined 13% for the quarter, while NAND cost per gigabyte declined by 23%. These cost declines exclude the NRV effects and idle facility costs associated with IM Flash Singapore. The successful ramp of our industry leading 34-nanometer MLC NAND product was a substantial contributor to this cost reduction. We expect to realize additional cost reductions in the second half of 2009, as 34-nanometer becomes the majority of our NAND wafer shipments. Overall NAND gross margins performance substantially improved quarter over quarter, albeit still negative.  NAND bit production in the third quarter is forecast to be in the high teens, as a result of a 200- millimeter phase out, offset by rapidly accelerating process node migrations. Continuing production efficiencies, and the 34-nanometer node transition, will lead to a quarterly cost per gigabyte decline, averaging mid to high teens for the second half of fiscal 2009.  Even though DRAM cost per gigabit declined by 12% quarter over quarter, de-ramped ASPs declined by an unusually high 30% in the same period, due in part to a decrease in the mix of higher ASP specialty DRAM products that service the weak consumer markets. These cost declines exclude NRV effects and idle capacity costs related to Micron’s supply agreement with Inotera. Qimonda has defaulted on its wafer purchase commitment to Inotera. As a result, Inotera has significantly reduced wafer production, triggering the idle capacity charges per our supply agreement. Due to the weak demand for consumer related products, we are phasing out 200-millimeter capacity in Boise and are adjusting all global 200-millimeter capacity to balance with projected future demand.  Fiscal Q3 DRAM cost reductions are expected to be in the mid to high single digits, and bit production is forecast to increase in the high single digit range, primarily due to 50-nanometer process node migrations, and relative stability in wafer production. These projections exclude charges associated with idle capacity at Inotera. Imaging gross margins were down as we experienced a slow down in unit sales and production, driving up per unit costs. Imaging gross margins did, however, remain positive at 2.8%.  Progress in reducing our operating cost structure continued in the second quarter. Restructuring programs and spending controls reduced SG&A expense to $90 million. This was below the guidance range of $100 to $105 million and 25% below the prior year period. R&D expense of $168 million was in line with projections, and resulted from ongoing cost management efforts and progress in transitioning products from development to production. We anticipate SG&A expenses to be in the $85 to $90 million range in fiscal Q3 ’09, and R&D expenses to be in the $175 to $180 million range. The increase in R&D expenses is primarily related to product qualifications. We expect the R&D spend to decrease in future quarters. We will continue to proactively manage our cost structure to enable Micron to remain competitive in this environment. Micron reported a net loss of $751 million or $0.97 per diluted share for the quarter, compared to a loss of $706 million or $0.91 per share in the prior quarter. The net loss includes restructuring charges of $105 million, which incorporates two major items. First, restructuring costs of $17 million related to employee severance. Second, an $87 million non-cash charge for asset write-downs related to the Boise fab phase out. Also, as a result of prevailing market conditions, the company wrote-off all of the $58 million of goodwill previously included in the imaging segment. This eliminates all remaining goodwill on Micron’s balance sheet. Headcount declined by 5% in the quarter to 20,794 employees worldwide. In financing activities, Micron utilized new loan proceeds to contribute $99 million to the TECH Singapore joint venture. Total debt increased by $29 million to $2.895 billion, as the normal amortization of existing loans partially offset the new loan.  Q2 cash expenditures for property, plant and equipment totaled $139 million, down significantly from $334 million in the first quarter of 2009. Anticipated capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 have been refined to approximately $650 to $700 million from last quarter’s guidance of $650 to $750 million. It is important to note that nearly three-quarters of the 2009 capital expenditures were already spent in the first half. With that, I’ll close there and turn the commentary over to Mark Adams.
Mark W. Adams:  Thanks Ron. Goods shipments from Micron’s memory products were down slightly when compared to our fiscal Q1. The dip decline was driven by our strategic desire to optimize our production on more stable market segments, and manage our overall inventory through a relatively unpredictable demand cycle and the depressed pricing in our holiday quarter. Even so, due to our overall supply contraction in the market, our performance enabled us to grow share in both the DRAM and NAND segments. At a time where both NAND and DRAM pricing is trending in a positive direction, we see Micron as well positioned to take advantage of more favorable market conditions. Our core DRAM segment, which includes our PC and server business, grew 5% in big ship quarter over quarter. While market forecasts suggest the PC state to be down 10 to 15% range in Q1 calendar year ’09, we were able to drive market share growth from competition in this segment as well. Server revenue, as a percentage of our overall DRAM business, held steady at the 20% level. We continue to see an increase in memory content per system. Q2 [inaudible] are approximately 2.4 gigabytes and trending to 2.6 gigabytes in calendar Q2.  Although the industry migration from DDR2 to DDR3 has been slower than anticipated, Micron continues to lead in this transition with our 50 [anometer] DDR3 product. The shipment of Micron’s technology leading DDR3 product increased 125% in bit growth quarter over quarter and represented 20% of our overall DRAM sales. Networking shipments were down 10% quarter over quarter as we saw corporate spending negatively impact overall bit growth in Q2. The mobile segment saw a sharp decline in overall demand, which resulted in a build-up in mobile inventory. Net shipments in mobile were down 57%. Despite the challenge around the mobile business, Micron saw continued growth in shipments of MCPs, multi-chip packages, while we experienced a 73% increase from previous quarter shipments. Despite the reduced industry forecast from mobile in calendar year ’09, we continue to feel Micron is in a unique position for growth to drive bits in the mobile handsets with our portfolio products, including MCP, PSRAM, e-MMC NAND [based] technology, and mobile memory cards. During the quarter we saw a number of new OEM opportunities in mobile, largely driven by competitive suppliers unable to meet customer requirements. We expect that this new business will materialize over the remainder of 2009. [Inaudible] continues to be depressed in our fiscal Q2. It’s important to note that our fiscal Q2 included a December month where DRAM pricing was substantially lower than today’s pricing. Given the recent uptick in DRAM pricing during the last week, there appears to be market reaction to an ongoing reduction in DRAM supply. We believe that Micron is well positioned to take advantage of a potentially [inaudible] memory market that has seen almost two years of capital expenditure reductions and significant capacity from older technology coming offline.  In Q2 ’09, our NAND shipments were down 8% from the previous quarter, primarily due to our holiday production slowdown. Micron began shipping our industry leading 34-nanometer 32-gigabyte Flash NAND drive in high volume production this past quarter. In our current third quarter we are forecasting that the vast majority of our NAND shipments will be based on our 34-nanometer based products. We feel this puts us in a very strong position to beat our competition. Due to a decline in production of lower density NAND components, we are projecting a substantial increase in gigabytes per unit in fiscal Q3. As point in fact, we anticipate that Lexar’s average density per card will be approximately 3.5 gigabytes per card in fiscal [O3], an increase from under 3 gigabytes per unit during the holidays. Overall, our NAND units experienced substantial improvement for the quarter. [Inaudible] we caught up with demand pricing which led to component prices increasing in the channel, such that quarter to date NAND fees are up around 10%. In addition, [hydroid] product segments such as FFE, metrics and NAND for mobile phones represent large bit consumer applications which, in combination with reduced supply growth, we anticipate will lead us to improved production in the NAND market. General last few months of pricing in NAND increases, and the weaker increase in DRAM pricing, we are hopeful that the worst is behind us. While our Q2 results reflect a very tough memory market driven by over supply and a softening demand, we are optimistic that improving demand picture when coupled with the imagery supply contraction, can lead us to a more stable business environment. With that, I’ll hand it back over to Kipp.
Kipp A. Bedard :  Thanks Mark. We would now like to take questions from callers. Just a reminder, if you are using a speaker phone, please pick up the handset when asking a question so we can hear you clearly.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from James Covello - Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs:  Good afternoon guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe a couple of things. The content per box comment was interesting because, you know, there’s a lot of concern about the fact that content per box could be flattening out here. What gives us – what is driving the increase in content per box?
Mark W. Adams:  Jim, this is Mark. The content per box, I think, for us a lot of the projections we’re seeing that flatten that out is the percentage of bytes and bits going into netbooks and what have you. In the desktop arena, we’re seeing that it continues to drive toward a fairly good byte standard for configurations coming out of the manufacturing base. So while there is some growth, obviously, in the 2009 period for netbooks kind of having an impact on that, we still see the overall configuration being driven to 4 gigabytes for notebooks and desktop.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs:  You know, one of the other concerns that people have about the supply side argument is that there is a fair amount of latent or idled capacity that could come back online. As we get into a little bit of [alpha] period for DRAM and MRAM, and that that latent capacity coming back online would kind of stymie any price recovery. Do you guys have any thoughts on that?
Steven R. Appleton :  Yes, Jim, this is Steve. I think there’s a couple of things to point out around that. Some of it that you’re mentioning or I guess not that you’re mentioning but that’s going on in the industry, you know, the capacity that existed at – let’s use [Qimonda] as an example. The Richmond facility was running 30 thousand 12-inch per month. I mean that is just down and gone. And we can’t imagine a scenario where that recovers. They also were running about 40 thousand 8-inch per month on DRAM. In the 8-inch facility [say] next to the 12-inch. That’s down and gone. They’ve obviously stopped producing [inaudible]. I don’t think that capacity is coming back at all.  And I would also note our Intels, we shut down our 200-millimeter. I should say we’re in the process of shutting down our 200-millimeter here in Boise. We don’t expect that that would return. So there’s a fair amount of capacity that will not come back on. Now, the other part of the capacity that exists that I think you’re most notably mentioning is some of that capacity in Taiwan, and whether it’s what we just mentioned around 8 or 10, we know [inaudible] has had substantial reductions; [Prior Chip] announced reductions; etc. That capacity could come back on. I think there’s some truth that if it were to be in the short term, in other words in the next few months, that maybe some of it would be brought back on line if you had such a substantial increase in the ASP that it would make sense from a cash cost basis. But keep in mind that that capacity is going on for weeks over time, and it’s getting old. And in fact from my perspective, and one of the challenges that the Taiwan industry has, is that a lot of that capacity is old today by comparison to what Micron’s doing. So, you know, we’re already running production on next generation node and they haven’t made any transition yet for a lot of that capacity. So a few things have to happen. One, it has to be available pretty soon. It has to be upgraded, which would require a fair amount of money to do. So the other thing that probably no connection with that is I’ve seen some estimates where, in order for that capacity to make any sense at all, even on a cash basis, that the DRAM ASPs would need to get out somewhere closer to $2. And, you know, as Mark already mentioned and others, it’s really kind of in the $1.05, $1.10 range as we see today, which by the way, I’ll note that for those who don’t remember, the main pricing per gigabyte that’s down to about $0.70 and the DRAM pricing per gigabit got down to about $0.50.  And that’s one of the reasons that I think people might be a little surprised that our quarter over quarter pricing was down so much. Just as Mark noted, remember that the [inaudible] is an entire class in ASP and that was essentially the first third of our quarter that we had to deal with, as opposed to how other companies report, you know, not being offset like we are. So that’s just something to keep in mind, Jim.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: How much of a lag should we expect between the much better spot pricing we’ve been seeing and hopefully an increase in contract pricing? Thank you so much.
Kipp A. Bedard :  So the question being, Jim, the [inaudible] contract pricing catching up to where the spot is?
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: Yes.
Mark W. Adams:  Well, I don’t think it’s a tremendous lag. We’re starting to see a lot of customer inquiry in terms of supply agreement and negotiations for not just the next quarter for [Bedford] back halves. We’re starting to see some upward movement there. And I would suspect, you know, normally get too [formal] on the possession side of that, but I’d say, you know, it’s probably next quarter we’ll start to see a tightening there in terms of the overall gap being closed.
Ronald C. Foster:  Yes. What’s interesting, Jim, is of course when the price is going up, the customer only wants to negotiate once every three months. When it’s going down, [inaudible] say it every day. And that’s the natural trend that exists.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Tim Luke - Barclays Capital.
Tim Luke - Barclays Capital:  I was wondering if you could maybe clarify, out of today’s pricing, how you would have expected the revenue off the bit growth to look as you move out for the May quarter.
Steven R. Appleton:  Tim, I think maybe what you’re asking for is the quarter to date ASP update, and if that’s the case we’re looking at NAND being up about 10% over last quarter’s average. And in commodities, DRAM we’re looking it up mid-teens.
Tim Luke - Barclays Capital:  Up 15 in commodity?
Steven R. Appleton:  Correct.
Tim Luke - Barclays Capital:  And specialty?
Steven R. Appleton:  Specialty generally doesn’t move its pricing all that much. So to that end it’s really more of a mix, how many specialty bits we ship compared to commodity in the quarter. And of course that’s always a tough one to predict.
Tim Luke - Barclays Capital:  So Steve, could you just update us in forecast three how you perceived opportunities with Inotera and in terms of migrating that from trench to stack, and how that might be funded? And to what extent it appears that you’re still in some discussions with the Taiwanese Memory Corporation, and how you view that landscape.
Steven R. Appleton:  Well, with respect to – let me take Inotera first, and Mark Durcan’s here with us. You could probably chime in or answer something, if you have maybe a more granular question around it. But clearly they’re still running trench. And that – there’s a pilot line being put in place to be able to install our technology and prototype to stack conversion. The timing of that conversion is obviously the dependent upon the capital expenditures to finish out the conversion. And I would just say that we’re primarily focused right now on getting the pilot line running and getting the trench technology proven out in the facility before we lock down the schedule of conversion. But obviously you can expect us to do that moving forward. The financing of that is – we’re still looking at [breaks], considerations. Of course you know Inotera is a public company and they have historically financed their own conversion. And I know they’re looking at that. Of course, Nanya is a partner of their as well as [Permosa], and is part of Nanya. So all of that’s in the mix. In terms of what’s going on in Taiwan, obviously there were announcements the last couple of days that the Taiwan government had decided to choose [Alpeta] for the technology partner. I would just say that we’re still in discussions with the Taiwan government, but you know I do want to note that the deal that I think Alpeta – that’s okay with Alpeta is not okay with us. And, you know, we just haven’t seen any compelling reason yet in terms of benefits for Micron to participate there.  And I want to note that there has been a lot of speculation around the consolidation of the Taiwan assets, and I think others outside of Micron know as much as we do at this point. But, you know, there was some hope that there would probably be consolidation of assets and how that would occur, and obviously we had recommendations on how that – we think that that would be most effective, as well as others. And clearly that’s not going to happen right now. And so, we don’t know what happens now. As you know, the Taiwan company is I would say very unstable in terms of the debt and the cash structures.  And the good news is that when we look at really what exists in Taiwan, the two largest producers of – the two largest companies that deal in capacity are Power Chip and Inotera, and then ProMOS was pretty close to capacity and [Wind Rider] was not that much. And [inaudible] of course had a new power chip in [Alpeta]. You know, mainly [inaudible] small producers, but remember NAND and Inotera are already part of the Micron camp, if you will. And then what you really have is okay, what could happen with ProMOS? And [Lex Chip] and [inaudible] are already part of Alpeta, and I think [Win Barn] over time would probably decide to go with another product. So, you know, short of – there’s nothing really that’s not negative for Micron in the event that we aren’t able to come up with a formula that works for both us, and I think what the Taiwan government wants to do. But having said that, I mean, we’re ready to do something to the extent that it makes sense. We will pursue it and we’re still in discussions with them. But what Alpeta did just didn’t [make] much interest to us, frankly, and so that’s why we’re [not] on that.
Tim Luke - Barclays Capital:  I think you guys have said that you are likely to put your own capital into the Inotera migration, and then just more broadly as you look at your cash balances through the end of the year to what extent do you feel you might look to bolster it through sort of the capital markets or equipment financing?
Steven R. Appleton:  On the Inotera piece, you know, obviously we’re participating there now. And you know Ron had mentioned of course we have idle capacity charges that we’ll take. And we’re looking at that. But as I said, I think we’re hopeful that Inotera deal will [inaudible] finance its needs going forward as it has in the past, and that’s what we’re working towards. Ron, do you want to take the other question?
Ronald C. Foster:  Yes. Tim, this is Ron. In terms of Inotera, Steve already mentioned they’re a public company and have specifically worked on their own financing constructs. But to your question about do we, Micron, have any plans to deal with capital requirements and how to address them in the company, first of all they’re a function of our overall business needs, as you know, and market performance has a big effect on our capital requirements. We had a real good fix in the company on our spending, on our CapEx and on our working capital needs. And as I think you can observe from our results, we’re managing our cost structure very aggressively. We’ll continue to monitor market performance going forward, watch it closely, and our business needs relative to our capital requirements going forward. One thing I can tell you is we are comfortable with our ability to raise funds opportunistically as required going forward.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Co.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Co.:  First, if you could disclose what royalty revenues were in the quarter. And second question, just about the whole Taiwan infrastructure and potentially more of that capacity coming online. You know, you guys mentioned that its pretty lagging as to capacity, but I’m just wondering what kind of bit growth have you guys experienced for the same wafer capacity, and going from the 60 x nanometer node to the 50 x nanometer node? Because I think most of those guys are either at 60 x or even some of the guys are still predominantly at 70 x.
Ronald C. Foster:  Gary, this is Ron. The royalty revenue for the quarter was $33 million. I’ll hand it over to Mark.
Mark W. Adams:  Yes. On the Taiwan capacity, a significant percentage of it today is still what probably be referenced to 70 nanometer capacity. The difference between that and our 50 nanometer node is roughly a factor of 85 to 90%, as you go from that existing 70 nanometer capacity in Taiwan, I can’t even put wafer to bits for what we would experience on our nanometer node.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Co.:  And just let me clarify that sort of discussion about the Taiwanese memory company. You know, it really sounds like there’s no upside here to be gained in saddling up side by side with Alpeta, certainly not in terms of kicking in your IT for free, or in exchange for capacity, because you pretty much already have that agreement with Nanya and Inotera. So you know if you’re not involved in a discussion and don’t expect it to draw any kind of meaningful upside out of that negotiation, I mean, are we supposed to take away that any kind of participation in this memory holding company from Micron’s part is pretty much nil? And that for you guys kind of strategy here in Taiwan and building out your infrastructure is really in conjunction with Nanya and Inotera and Formosa Plastics?
Mark W. Adams:  Yes, Gary, I think that’s a good question. The first response I have is clearly we’re focused on the relationship we have with Nanya and Inotera and we’ll continue to be because we’re in that relationship now. Now we’re still talking to what they call [inaudible] in Taiwan [mini] court. And we’re interested in seeing how that evolves. I think that everyone would admit, probably even those involved from the Taiwan government or those that are consulting Taiwan’s government that this situation has changed a lot as it’s moved through time the last few months. And it’s still pretty fluid. As you already noted, we didn’t see much of an interest or advantage for us to do what Alpeta did, because we’re in I think different positions then and with everything [inaudible] and you’d expect us to say this, but our technology is far better than Alpeta’s.  And so we think we’re in a pretty good position, and it’s not that we’re not interested at all. It’s that we’re interested in finding something that really does make sense for us. And as of yet we haven’t been able to do that, but I wouldn’t rule that out in the future. And we’re still interested to the extent that something could be developed.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Co.:  You talked about DRAM. I think it was bit shipment or bit production in the third quarter, up mid to high single digits. You know, basically I have talked to a lot of DRAM manufacturers and a lot of the PC OEMs, at least two to three weeks ago, were kind of quoting bit shipment sort of forecasts in the calendar Q2 period of up 15 to 20%. Has anything changed at the margin specifically to commodity PC shipment expectations here over the near term?
Mark W. Adams:  The answer to that is no. Just in keep in mind that our reference is to production bits, not to shipment bits.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Uche Orji – UBS.
Uche Orji – UBS:  Let me just start by asking you about your views on inventory. I mean, in your case the inventory has gone up to 61 days from 43 and you talked about having enough inventory to take advantage of the market. What is your sense of the inventory across the China, including the module makers and the OEMs? Are we in a situation where everybody has taken advantage of the lower priced inventory and therefore your expectations to take advantage doesn’t come through?
Mark W. Adams: So on the inventory side, we think the OEMs are probably in a healthier position at current state. On the channel side, we see a lot of activity and we see as I mentioned in our last call, we think that they’re pretty good control on the channel piece of the DRAM state. So the OEMs are in pretty healthy position. I wouldn’t say out of balance. I just think they’re in pretty flush position as far as the current demand. But the channel piece is pretty fluid. We feel pretty good about that. We don’t see too much back up on the channel piece.
Uche Orji – UBS:  Just in terms of Europe, what is your transition rate right now? I mean if you can you give us a sense to what it is within DRAM and NAND? A couple of your competitors are running below full capacity [inaudible]. What is your sense of where you are and where the rest of the company today?
Mark W. Adams:  So on the 300 millimeter capacity, we’re running all the Micron fabs at 100% today. The – I want to mention there is some idle capacity at the Inotera fab, given what happened with Qimonda there. And on the 200 millimeter there’s – you know, we’ve been moving through a rough phase here as we engaged in the holiday shutdown and are rebalancing relative to demand. So on the 200 millimeter side, you know, we’re taking actions in terms of taking capacity off line here in Boise, and we think that 200 millimeter situation will stabilize out in the calendar – late calendar Q3 and into calendar Q4, be stable it, essentially get balance of remaining supply online and being able to run that essentially to full utilization.
Uche Orji – UBS:  And then just lastly, please, on the CapEx. On the new guidance of $650 to $700, how much is going to come from your partners? And while you’re explaining that, can you just give me an idea of how much of the term loan you intend to draw, how do you plan to reduce the remainder of the terms for the rest of the life of that? Thank you.
Ronald C. Foster:  This is Ron. In terms of our CapEx as I mentioned nearly three-quarters of it has already been spent for the fiscal year, so we’ve got a really declining portion. And a chunk of that is related to payments as was mentioned earlier on some of our equipment. It’s already in place for our new technologies. So a piece of it is coming from our partners. I don’t have the guidance in terms of the exact breakdown, but there’s not a whole lot in the pipe in the second half. And can you give me again the question about the term loan?
Uche Orji – UBS:  The term loan, you have a $300 million term loan, you know, you took out with [inaudible] and you drew down $150. What is the plan for the remainder of the term loan?
Ronald C. Foster:  Okay. Yes. We took a term loan out which needs to be drawn down within one year of the first draw. And we took half of the $300 [same] dollar, $150 million [$10] in the first draw down. We have to get the second draw down within 12 months of the first.
Uche Orji – UBS:  You need to draw that down for what?
Ronald C. Foster:  The application of the loan in Singapore specifically related to our TECH joint venture majority owned facility, and our commitment to put capital in there for the new DRAM 16-nanometer technology – 50-millimeter technology. Excuse me.
Operator:  Your next question comes from John Pitzer - Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse:  I know there’s a lot of moving parts, but when you look at the full calendar year can you just review your assumptions now for both Micron DRAM bit growth and industry bit growth for the calendar year? And I’d kind of be curious as to how you feel that might trend half on half as well sequentially.
Steven R. Appleton:  We haven’t given a year on year bit growth number for Micron. As you know we tend to keep you more quarterly focused for that. What we’re seeing out in the market is a range now of anywhere from say a low of 2, 3, 4% up to maybe 15, 16, 17% for DRAM expectations. For NAND looks like the ranges are more in the 40 to 50% range for bit growth year-over-year.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse:  Can we start from DRAM on how industry supply might grow half on half sequentially?
Steven R. Appleton:  Well, we were talking a little bit about that today, and it looks like if you start with say a wafer look, we think it’s down about 20, 25% in calendar Q1. Probably down 30, 35% for DRAM in Q2. So obviously bit’s down both in the first half, with a little bit difficult refers now back to what kind of pricing scenario in the second half of the year and does any of the idle capacity come back on. So it’s a really pretty tough call right now, John, to look that far forward.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse:  And then guys you mentioned sort of [SFC’s], netbooks and mobile as doing the demand driver on the handsets. Can you talk a little bit about how you see the SFC market developing for the balance of this year and next? And do you think, you know, we’ve seen unusually good pricing for NAND and what’s typically a seasonally soft calendar first quarter. What do you think is driving that?
D. Mark Durcan:  I think the – I think you hit on the demand side of this and certainly the supply side of this picture. But the demand thing, I think, is encouraging at the current price levels and the evolution of applications like SFPs which between even combined with netbooks, embedded in netbooks, but also your notebook applications. And a lot of work being done on the enterprise side that, you know, after about two years of development and investment in controller technology and firmware, I think we’re seeing a lot of progress at the major OEM level from the rollout of SFPs and pilots and really that category is maturing.  So from a price equation and the application side of SSDs and the growth of netbooks, and then when you kind of lay that on to the Smartphone market, which is still a pretty healthy market, I realize that the overall mobile market is – has got a revised decline in terms of overall projection, but we’re still talking about 1 billion units. And on Smartphones you’re talking somewhere in the neighborhood of 16 to 20%, somewhere in there you’ve got 150 to 200 million units. They’re going to have high demand of density NAND in there.  So you combine all that, and you look at the last year-and-a-half to two years in NAND CapEx, and certainly over the last six to 12 months in terms of some of our competitors and their reduction in supply, its combined obviously to a favorable situation today. And as I said earlier we’re – a good quarter for us in NAND and our growth in terms of our customer relationships and overall supply. And they’re really certainly endorsed and excited about the 34-nanometer.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse:  Any guidelines as to when SSDs might be 10% of your NAND supply?
D. Mark Durcan:  At this point it’s hard to. A lot of our work in the SSD space has been in the enterprise space as we’ve indicated in the past. I would say that the development of relationships out of our business for our two customers around enterprise SSDs has been pretty favorable and it looks seeming to be accelerated. Hard for me to comment today on when that would take on revenue level of 10%.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse:  One last question for Steve. Steve, just given the attention to wanting to buy assets on the cheap, I’m just wondering if you could talk a little bit about whether or not you see any strategic synergies in the NOR market relative to your business?
Steven R. Appleton:  Well, we look at the memory business holistically. As you know, we were in the NOR business at one time. And obviously we’re in the NAND and the DRAM. And those are all components of the memory business. I would say that, you know, we continue to look at the entire landscape as to what may make sense. And I guess I’ll just leave it at that. If there’s something where we think we can generate synergy, and overall be accretive for the company, then we’ll take a look. And if that’s not going to be the case, then we’ll probably pass on the opportunity. But I would say we’re pretty open in looking at everything that’s in the space.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan.
Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan:  For February, I don’t think I caught it, but what did your DRAM production do sequentially in bits and NAND production?
Mark W. Adams :  It was down mid to high single digits, Shawn.
Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan:  DRAM was down?
Mark W. Adams :  That’s correct.
Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan:  Mid to high single, and NAND did what?
Mark W. Adams :  NAND was down about mid single digits.
Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan:  And what did your wafer production do sequentially?
Mark W. Adams :  It was down about 20%, and we should be up a percent or two this quarter.
Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan:  And then for the NAND landscape, what are your PC OEMs telling you to expect for DRAM bit demand in calendar Q2? And maybe even further out, if they’re giving you any visibility that far.
Mark W. Adams :  The visibility question I’ll answer first. They’re hedging a lot right now, based on coming out of their holiday quarter and then reconciling kind of the new environment, if you will. So I would say that’s a little bit tougher longer term. In the short term, the bit demand is up. But again it’s up reduced from our original plan on some [que] OEMs. As I mentioned during my opening comments, its not been a bad thing for Micron to be able to capture some share at these que OEMs, so I think they’re bit demand is certainly down from where they might have called it going into the calendar year. For Micron we feel pretty bullish that we’ll be able to capture some decent share given the competitive landscape.
Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan:  So your PC OEMs expect calendar Q2 to be up in terms of bit demand sequentially globally?
Mark W. Adams:  Yes.
Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan:  And then can you rank for us, I guess, the strength you think that you’ll have in the May quarter for shipments by your various end markets that you ship to?
Ronald C. Foster: Sure. I guess I’ll take a shot, but I would guess, listening to Mark, probably the commodity memory has pretty good strength. We are starting to see some early signs in the handset markets for a turn there, so specialty memory could possibly take a tick out. I think it’s pretty clear that NAND is on a pretty good trajectory based on his earlier comment about density growth in almost every category; cards, phones, almost cameras, everything that uses it is going through a pretty good density jump. So it looks like we’re entering a period where several of the different segments have either settled down and starting to make a turn or there’s at least early finds that they’re starting to look better. I would also add that we’re seeing the same thing in the imaging area, too, that it’s probably troughed and it looks like its coming back.
Operator:  Your next question comes from David Wong - Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC.
David Wong - Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC:  Can you announce whether you’re expecting any payment from Nanya or Inotera for technology transfers any time in the near future?
Ronald C. Foster:  David, this is Ron. We have a technology agreement, and get regular payments on a quarterly basis. And that’s a significant percentage of the royalty payments I reported on this quarter at $33 million. And we’ll get those payments on a go forward basis.
David Wong - Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC:  So it would be a fairly constant rate. That doesn’t drop as the year progresses at all.
Ronald C. Foster:  Yes, for the technology portion of the agreement. There’s also a portion that can be related with production or shipments, which we also collect a royalty on, but that has not initiated yet.
David Wong - Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC:  Any feeling for when that might begin to ramp?
Ronald C. Foster:  I don’t have a projection at this point.
David Wong - Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC:  Your cash balances were down something like $100 million in this last quarter. Would we expect the number something like this or less going forward? Or was there any special factors that reduced your cash flow in the current quarter that don’t recur?
Ronald C. Foster:  David, there’s a lot of puts and takes in our cash balance. As I mentioned capital requirements are a function of not only our operating requirements, which we have a pretty good fix on and been very carefully managing, but also the overall market movements, price trends, etc. So I don’t have a forecast for you going forward on cash balance, but we’re obviously watching it and managing it carefully.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Kevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel Partners.
Kevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel Partners:  In your licensing discussions with PMC, is Flash IP mentioned at all?
Mark W. Adams :  While we say mentioned, I think there are some parties, Intel, that would probably be desirous of some type of flash technology. And so in respect to those discussions, but it hasn’t been any part of what we’ve been talking about with them. And to our knowledge, it’s primarily all been focused on DRAM at this point.
Kevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel Partners:  And on the DRAM, if you were to come to an agreement with them, when do you think the conversion to your technology would take? Six months after the agreement or sooner than that would you say?
Mark W. Adams :  Yes. We don’t have any idea because I think that thing were probably worth noting if you’ve looked at any of the recent media around what’s happening in Taiwan, even with this month’s recent announcement in Alpeta is that they’re talking about doing technology development in the next year as opposed to any technology deployment. And so I think in that context, no matter who it is, whether it’s Alpeta or Micron or somebody else, I don’t think that we’re talking about something of significance in the short term.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA.
Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA:  Since we’re on the topic of NAND IP, as you move beyond 34-nanometer and you look at charge copying versus fully engaged, is there any IP that you feel you’ll need to go out and license? Or do you feel like you have everything in house to do what’s required?
D. Mark Durcan:  Dan, this is Mark. Yes, I think we’re in pretty good shape on the technology on that and the intellectual property associated with it.
Operator:  Your next question comes from [Unidentified Analyst] – Citigroup.
Unidentified Analyst – Citigroup:  Can you discuss your guidance for depreciation this quarter? I’m sorry, for the May quarter.
Ronald C. Foster:  This is Ron. We had depreciation around $540 million in the current quarter, and roughly speaking it’ll be in that sort of range, maybe up a little bit going forward.
Unidentified Analyst – Citigroup: And PMC has discussed their interest in mobile DRAM. Is that also include commodities DRAM as well or?
D. Mark Durcan:  It probably depends on what part you’re talking about. There – just for clarification, by the way, in the mobile sector there’s both NAND and DRAM in place there. And DRAM is typically what we call low power and it’s usually – there’s a combination of low power DRAM with a NAND that is going into what we call MCP, a multi-chip package. And that is clearly – that part of the business is growing. There’s another part of the business that has to do with pseudo static RAM and neural, and as you might know we’re a producer of pseudo static RAM. I would say that the expectation is that that will decline over time as part of the mobile segment.  So we don’t really characterize it. I think what you’re calling the commodity DRAM, although I’ll just tell you it’s not that much different in terms of how it behaves on pricing. It’s just that it goes in a combined package before it gets to the wireless customer.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank Securities.
Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank Securities:  You mentioned a few kind of one time things that hit gross margin, the Inotera under utilization and then also IM class Singapore. You mentioned that they would go down in 3Q. Can you kind of size how big the impact was and how much improvement you can see in the third quarter?
Ronald C. Foster:  Yes, Bob, this is Ron. If you look at the under utilized capacity activities, the impact on Inotera is a function of resolving their capacity plan going forward. So at current level we’re at capacity with Qimonda is not being utilized. The trench capacity is not being produced. It’ll be roughly the same dollar range for Inotera in the next quarter. And on IMFS it actually will come down in the third quarter compared to the second quarter as a result of winding down activities there, and reducing our overall cost structure going forward. So it’ll be a relatively small number in future quarters.
Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank Securities:  Just on a sizing side of this, tens of millions? Just could you try and get an idea of the magnitude of potential improvement?
Ronald C. Foster:  Well, it’s $60 million range, as I mentioned, in Q2. It’s going to come down marginally in the third quarter, assuming that Inotera is still not running its idle capacity. That’s the majority of the total idle cost.
Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank Securities:  Ron, just the other question I have is just on Lexar, can you give some color on how Lexar’s doing in the retail NAND Flash demand, what you’re seeing there?
Ronald C. Foster:  Well, overall that business through the holidays was down from a market perspective. The other interesting part of that is that behaviorally retail pricing doesn’t ever tend to tick up. Now what normally happens is there’s less of a price protection move coming out of the holiday, and that was true this year. In January and February there’s normally a correction in pricing downward. That didn’t necessarily take place, and so what you saw was rising component prices in the retail, and a flat ASP.  So we were less aggressive on the rebate side, and the price protection side if you review history was you know you can see [Sandus] quarterly results from the holiday period Q4, you saw some substantial gross margin pressure. So we’re being very selective in terms of growth opportunities and how we expand our channels right now because it’s a very tricky time in retail. You’ve got manufacturing supply coming inbound. That’s probably a little bit more than the market leader can deploy. As a matter of fact, I think they’re giving another outlook that they’ve used in the past to other channels. And so as we see that, we’re looking at the Lexar business to continue to grow and grow in places we can control our operations to be profitable, and not necessarily grow in markets that are really challenged in terms of emerging market applications today.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Kevin Vassily - Pacific Crest Securities.
Kevin Vassily - Pacific Crest Securities:  First on 50-nanometer DRAM, can you talk about what percent of your DRAM output right now is running on 50-nanometer?
D. Mark Durcan:  Sure. This is Mark. It’s a relatively small piece of the outfit today, probably on a wafer start basis I’d say we’re in the less than 10% range today. That’ll move to essentially 100% of the wafer starts in Virginia, which is on the order of 25 to 30% over all Micron starts by the end of the calendar year. I take that back. I apologize. By the end of the calendar year, we’ll be running on the order of 50% on the 50-nanometer. Today probably less than 10%.
Kevin Vassily - Pacific Crest Securities:  So from 10 to 50. Okay. So, can you help reconcile that with your CapEx budget right now? Because the general consensus is that, you know, 50-nm requires emerging lithographies. Those aren’t exactly inexpensive tools, although I guess maybe in this environment there’s probably some price leeway. Given the number of emergent tools you might need to do this, it seems like your CapEx budget looks a little low. Is there something else going on there or have you already done kind of the purchases there? Or are you using an alternative process? Can you help there?
D. Mark Durcan:  Yes. There’s a number of different factors going on. First of all, there’s a fiscal and calendar year transition that happens in there. But most importantly we are pretty conscious when we design our process changes in a capital effective way. And so a lot of the capital that other folks have associated with their transitions to 50-nm are things like softer metallurization, for instance. We’ve already taken care of that when we put the [track] in place in the first place.  So for us, you’re right, there’s some amount of emerging stepper capacity required. It’s not that much, and part of that’s on the floor already. And other than that, we’re in equal shape. So the – I think the way to summarize it would be to say that the 50-nanometer low transition relative to Virginia is – you know, the cash flow associated with completing that transition by the end of the calendar year from a cash flow perspective those tools will be in place near the end of the fiscal year and that’s all contemplated in the forecast we’ve given you.
Kevin Vassily - Pacific Crest Securities:  The question about the 200-millimeter plant in Boise that’s ramping down, were you running any specialty DRAM in that fab? Or was it all NAND?
D. Mark Durcan:  Well, it depends what timeframe you’re talking about, but initially it was about 50% and if you go back nine months it’s about 50% NAND and 50% DRAM. More recently we took out a significant piece of the ML CRAM, you’ll remember, and we were running some small amount of SL CRAM and the rest was specialty DRAM and some filler DRAM. And that piece is now gone away in its entirety there as we transition on to the fiscal year.
Kevin Vassily - Pacific Crest Securities:  One last question for Steve. I think you were addressing these relative to Taiwan Memory Corp. You mentioned that you’re not interested in a deal that [Alpeta] seemed to be willing to take. Can you shed any light on what exactly that deal is and why it seems objectionable relative to kind of what you guys hope to get out of some type of relationship?
Steven R. Appleton:  Well, I probably ought to let Alpeta answer. I guess – let me characterize it such that you know – let me just characterize it from Micron’s perspective and not try to speak on Alpeta’s behalf. But simply getting an investment in Micron, you know, in exchange for let’s just call it equity or some other type of instrument, and then having to deploy all of our technology in exchange for that doesn’t really interest us because we’re not in a position to get – I don’t know about Alpeta, but we’re not in a position today where we need to get an equity investment from a foreign entity in order and they have to turn over our technology, you know, with other considerations. We just don’t see the advantages for us to do that. And there may be other [inaudible] that we could achieve that could make sense for us, but that’s not one of them.
Kevin Vassily - Pacific Crest Securities:  So it’s more the equity vested side and what you’re getting in return for that. Okay. That’s helpful. Thank you.

I would like to now turn the call over to Mr. Ron Foster.
Ronald Foster: Thanks Kipp. For those listeners who haven’t seen our press release, which is available on our website and includes a reconciliation of the non-GAAP numbers discussed on this call, I will briefly review the summary financial results for the first quarter, which ended December 4. Revenue for the first quarter decreased 3% compared to the prior quarter and gross margin declined to minus 32% as megabit DRAM and NAND ASP declines outpaced cost reductions. Memory revenues included $36 million in royalty and technology fees. The sharp declines in memory ASPs during the quarter triggered a $369 million non-cash write-down of memory inventories to estimated market value. Including this write-down the company recorded a net loss of $760 million or $0.91 per diluted share for the quarter compared to a loss of $344 million or $0.45 per share in the prior quarter.  In the DRAM space quarterly ASPs declined by an unusually high 34% while our cost per gigabit declined by 12%. These DRAM cost reductions results came in at an aggressive end of our forecast due to successful process node migrations and manufacturing efficiencies.  Fiscal Q2 forecast is for DRAM cost reductions to be flat and bit production will decline as a result of factory production slowdowns over the holiday season.  In NAND average selling prices also declined significantly by 24% while our cost per gigabyte declined by 14%. Successful ramp of our new 34-nanometer MLC NAND product helped us achieve the cost reduction. Now more then half our [inaudible] are produced on the 34-nanometer process node and we will begin to realize increasing benefits as we come down the cost curve after Q2. NAND bit production in the second quarter is forecasted decline as a result of factory slowdowns. However continuing cost reductions and the 34-nanometer node transition will improve cost per gigabyte despite the factory slowdowns. Energy and raw materials were flat quarter to quarter with consistent positive gross margin performance. Progress in reducing our operating cost structure continued in the first quarter. Despite a 14-week quarter we were pleased with our SG&A expense controls. They were $102 million, a decline of 5% in absolute terms versus last quarter due to the company’s cost cutting and restructuring activities. R&D expenses of $178 million also came in below our projections for the quarter due to ongoing cost management efforts and progress moving key development products into production. We anticipate SG&A expenses to be in the $100 million to $105 million range in the second quarter and R&D expenses to be in the $165 million to $170 million range during the same timeframe. We will continue to proactively manage our cost structure to enable Micron to remain competitive in this environment.  Also of note, Micron’s net loss includes a restructuring credit which incorporates two major items. First we recorded restructuring costs of $22 million related to employee severance. Second we recorded an $88 million credit for termination of the Boise supply agreement related to our joint venture with Intel. Given the challenging market environment Micron has undertaken additional cost savings measures to enable us to increase our competitiveness. These actions include reductions in executive and employee salaries, and elimination of bonuses, a continued hiring freeze, and reduction of other discretionary costs such as outside services, travel, and overtime.  These actions are anticipated to save an additional $200 million of manufacturing and operating cash costs in the remainder of 2009. Also in Q1 headcount declined nearly 7% to 21,888 quarter to quarter. We ended the quarter with just over $1 billion in cash and short-term investments. Operating cash flow contributed $359 million in the first quarter and increased to 48% in the prior quarter. This increase was realized primarily through improved working capital management in inventory and trade accounts receivable.  During the first quarter Micron received strategic financing of $285 million with favorable terms as part of the $400 million acquisition of Qimonda’s 35.6% stake in Inotera which was completed on November 26.  Through this acquisition Micron will receive 50% of wafers produced by Inotera once fully transitioned. This will represent capacity of over 60,300 mm wafers per month for Micron. Going forward approximately 36% of Inotera’s net income or loss will be reflected as non-cash item on Micron’s financial statements in other non-operating income or expense. In other financing activity during the quarter Micro paid off debt including that borrowed in Japan of $101 million. Total debt increased by $140 million to $2.87 billion in the first quarter.  Capital expenditures for the first quarter totaled $334 million, down significantly from $759 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Anticipated capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 have been revised downward to approximately $650 million to $750 million from last quarter’s FY09 guidance of $1 billion to $1.3 billion.  Micron and Intel have agreed to delay the IMFS fab build out in Singapore until market conditions improve. In addition the capital contributions previously committed to our Maya joint venture with Nan Ya have been deferred. We anticipate that the Maya joint venture will be folded into Inotera in the near future. Inotera is a publically traded company that manages its capital requirements separately from Micron. Micron has not yet made any capital commitments associated with Inotera.  I’ll close there and turn the commentary over to Mark Adams.
Mark Adams : Thanks Ronald, despite continued industry oversupply and the global economic downturn Micron was able to drive DRAM bit shipment growth of 35% and NAND bit shipment growth of 40%.  In these tough market conditions we have found that our key customers are looking for Micron to increasingly support their memory needs. While PC desktop systems showed signs of weakening demand going into the holidays the notebook segment continued to show positive growth.  Memory content per system was 2 gigabyte in Q1. In addition we are seeing a growing demand for our DDR3 product with shipment growth of 96% quarter over quarter. Clearly Micron is in strong competitive position as a leader in DDR3 technology. Our server and networking shipments were flat quarter over quarter. We remain optimistic that we can increase our leadership position in these segments due to competitive reduction in output for these products.  The mobile segment continues to be a bright spot for Micron. Shipments of MCPs, multi [chip] packages, were 1.9 million units, a dramatic increase quarter over quarter. We anticipate increasing density per unit in this category to drive growth for Micron in 2009.  Our product portfolio in mobile has evolved in the second half of 2008. Micron is in a unique position to drive bits into mobile handsets with MCPs, imbedded NAND technology, and mobile memory cards.  In Q1 2009 Micron began shipping our 34-nanometer 32-gigabit flash memory product in high volume production. As we enter calendar year 2009 Micron is in a cost leadership position which translates into a stronger operating performance from our NAND business.  On the DRAM technology front Micron recently launched our [50] nanometer product which boasts the smallest [inaudible] in the industry. Our customers and partners are excited about the [efficiencies] in this technology that will generate as we move forward into 2009. During the last six months our Lexar business began shipment of two major retailers that are ranked in the top 10 in North America. Lexar is now solidly positioned in the number two position in the North American retail market space.  At a time where our channel competitors face severe challenges we continue to see a renewed confidence in Micron’s commitment to the retail channel at major customers worldwide with the Lexar and Crucial brands.  Lexar announced a number of industry leading performance products in photography, mobile, and gaming for the holiday season. In fact, the Lexar [Shoot and Sink] product was featured today on the CBS early morning show.  While the combination of industry oversupply and the overall global economic crisis continues to put pressure on Micron and our competition we feel confident of our position and strength in the eyes of our customers.  Our recent announcement regarding the acquisition of Inotera Capacity, further highlights that Micron can be a scale technology partner serving a broad array of market segments. As we enter 2009 we will continue to monitor the industry reductions and capital expenditures already in the mid-30s in 2008 and projected to be 18% to 20% in 2009. With that we ready for your questions. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Betsy Van Hees – Caris & Company
Betsy Van Hees – Caris & Company: Could you give us a little bit of color in terms of fiscal Q2 what type of reductions we’re going to see in bit growth, bit supply.
Ronald Foster : Given the market conditions and the slowdown we already have in place throughout the holidays we want to try and stay away from precise bit guidance this quarter. We’re going to be pretty reactive on a go forward basis and see what plays out in the marketplace and I think throwing any guidance out there right now might be as likely to be misleading as helpful.
Betsy Van Hees – Caris & Company: When we’re looking at pricing can you give us from when your quarter started if DRAM ASPs were not to decline any further what type of price reductions we would see.
Mark Adams : It looks like we’re going to see, if nothing changed from here to the end of the quarter we’d be about down mid-teens on the DRAM side of the business and closer to down to high 20% mid 30% in NAND. That doesn’t factor in the last week of activity in pricing which has been quite favorable both in DRAM and NAND. We’re hesitant to make too much of a conclusion on the uptick in DRAM pricing and NAND over the last five business days or so but certainly positive about it and want to stay on top of it going into the post Christmas season. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung – Citigroup 
Glen Yeung – Citigroup : I was wondering if you could talk about your expectations for bit supply growth on DRAM and NAND in fiscal 2009 and how it will compare to the industry. 
Ronald Foster : Its similar to what Mark’s comments were about our production and our view on how we’ll react. You can imagine that the estimates for bit growth in calendar 2009 from the industry are wide as well. What we’ve seen out there so far expectations in DRAM in bit growth is as low as 20% maybe as high as 40%.  And NAND we’ve seen anywhere from about 70% bit growth up to about maybe potentially 100%. 
Glen Yeung – Citigroup : Can you talk about inventories that you’re seeing in the channel currently and you talked a bit about being hesitant to make any comments on the recent movement in DRAM spot pricing but I guess if you can discuss what you see for any potential for increases in first half January. 
Mark Adams : The inventory position in the channel is quite favorable both in DRAM and NAND and actually we think that’s very much connected the activity of last week in the spot market. The dramatic increase in pricing on both DRAM and NAND to us was a pretty good indicator that people have been pretty prudent in planning their inventory going into the holiday season and even managing it through all the way up to where we are today.  The big question mark becomes the demand profile that comes out of Christmas and the inventories at the resellers and the retailers after the Christmas season which will drive which way the price moves but again, I think the indication that we got as of last week is that the inventories are pretty light, very light on NAND and I would say that what we learned last week, equally light in the DRAM segment.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Luke – Barclays Capital 
Tim Luke – Barclays Capital:  I was wondering if you could provide a bit of color on some of the factors that have contributed to the somewhat stronger then expected bit growth in the quarter that you had reported and I was wondering also if you could comment on how you perceive the potential for any actions in terms of further consolidation in the Taiwanese market in terms of DRAM.
Mark Adams : Relative to the cost improvement and I think there’s a number of factors but I wouldn’t want to downplay the efforts we’ve been making on just an operational cost to labor perspective and the controls we have over all of our manufacturing costs. Technology transitions have also done very well in the 34 nanometer, our NAND continues to move ahead smoothly with better then expected yields there and on the legacy 50-nm node and the transition to 68-nm on DRAM going well as well. 
Steven Appleton : On consolidation I’ve said now for several months that the current environment is right for driving some type of activity around consolidations. Clearly there’s been a number of announcements around governments willing to help out the industry and I would say that although I think the initial interpretation of that might be to believe that that would essentially cancel any consolidation efforts, I don’t think that’s true at all.  I think that there’s still quite a desire among both the companies and probably some of these governmental entities that are involved in these discussions around providing funds to the [inaudible] and inject some working capital that there’s still a large interest there to try to help them. It takes time. I don’t think anybody thinks that the next few months are going to be just awesome for the industry and as a result I think that all of the discussion around potential consolidation will continue. Obviously I’ve said before as well that Micron is continuing to look at it and see if there’s any opportunity for us to participate in that and so that’s where we’re at right now. I think clearly we have to get through this week to see, there’s not too much activity but I don’t, I’m not under the belief at all that consolidation goes away now that some of these governments have talked about stepping in and trying to help out the industry. 
Tim Luke – Barclays Capital: With respect to the gross margin, its obviously been under significant pressure, can you give us what you think is the key elements of the roadmap to get that back into more favorable territory?
Steven Appleton : Well if you look at the gross margin, there’s a couple of different ways to look at it. One of them of course is with and without the [ARVs] charge and [ARV] makes the gross margin look pretty bad but that’s obviously based on a forecast going forward but, we’re pretty conservative and we just don’t really know what’s going to happen there but we want to do the formulas and run the model and then you have to put that in there. The other impact on gross margin is really on the ASP cost side which I just mentioned the ASP forecast side that gets put back into the model, the other is on the cost side and I think as Mark Durcan described we’ll continue to make a lot of efforts on that and use the costs.  It’s a little bit of a mixed perception although its very helpful to have ASPs increase. It can improve our margin quarter by quarter if we can just get a little bit of stability in the pricing as opposed to what Ronald described which was, just the decreases in pricing of [inaudible] in terms of cost reductions and if we can just get some stability in the pricing itself or it doesn’t continue to decline at those kind of rates then we’ll start to build margin back in and that’s I think the way its been at least in the near-term and going forward. 
Tim Luke – Barclays Capital: You cash balance went to around just $1 billion why do you feel comfortable maintaining that going forward and how do you expect that to trend?
Steven Appleton : I think in particular in the next quarter it will trend down but we have I think that Ronald mentioned our cash flow from operations was pretty positive in the quarter that we’ve just announced. We think that will decrease although I will say that we believe it will still remain positive for the quarter that we’re in and obviously we’ve been [dialing] the CapEx down. We’ve done lots of other things on the cost side so we’ll continue to be pretty diligent about making sure that we have a pretty good cash balance.  I would also say though that I think Ron’s team have done a great job. We can obviously operate the company on much, much less cash then that but we’re still going to remain pretty conservative in our approach and try to make sure that we maintain a pretty good balance.  
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster - JPMorgan 
Shawn Webster - JPMorgan:  I understand that you don’t want to give specific guidance on production for Q2, can you share with us what the sequential change in production in Q1 was for both NAND and DRAM. 
Ronald Foster : Bit growth on a production basis in DRAM was up at mid-teens range, 14% and we had NAND production bit growth up 8%. You might recall the original guidance was around mid teens but we initiated the shutdown of the MLC in Boise midway through the quarter. 
Shawn Webster - JPMorgan: Are the effects that are happening in Q2 in terms of a sequential decline in bits mostly related to Boise or is there other stuff you’re doing as well. 
Mark Adams : If you’re referencing the slowdown that’s worldwide depending on the product line. Some product lines are impacted less then others. As you know we only build what we think of is the more commoditized stuff. Obviously we have less specialty DRAM and some of those products have pretty good margin and also are either single [inaudible] source and we’ve got to continue to support the customer base so its not 100% worldwide. That’s why we called it a slowdown as opposed to a shutdown but most facilities around the world are being impacted. 
Shawn Webster - JPMorgan: What did your wafers to sequentially in Q1.
Ronald Foster : We were up about 9%. 
Shawn Webster - JPMorgan: And that inventory write-down, what was the mix between NAND and DRAM?
Ronald Foster : We don’t normally break that down between the two because we have a lot of complex computations and cross over inventory etc. but in general it was a little heavier to DRAM this quarter out of the total [inaudible]. 
Shawn Webster - JPMorgan: All the I guess discussions on government funding for memory companies globally, can you talk about Micron’s role, what your plans may be to the extent you can talk about them both in Asia as well as in the USA?
Steven Appleton: Well we’re [inaudible] USA so I can’t say too much about that. I don’t have any idea on how we might participate in something there going forward but I’m not, and I haven’t done any analysis on whether we want to or not. But with respect to some of the other regions, obviously in particular there’s a lot of news coming out of Asia, we have operations in Asia as you know.  We now have not only a partnership but we have a fab operation that’s in Taiwan and we already operate in Singapore and to the extent that those governments are interested in assisting their industries, clearly we’re interested in understanding how that might impact what we’re doing in those areas and how we might be able to participate in that and the benefit of the joint ventures etc. so we are continuing to look at that and have interaction with those people in that region and its undetermined at the moment just how that will play out. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Covello - Goldman Sachs 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs:  On content for box, thoughts on content per box for the industry as you move through 2009 it seems like its holding up okay for now, a lot of concerns in the market that that would slow down considerably as we go through 2009, what are your thoughts. 
Mark Adams : On the PC side, PC server segment we continue to see driving across the 2 gigabyte per system box density and while there has been a lot of discussions and comments on that slowing down we see it along the same trend line.  On the other devices, i.e. mobile phones, we’re pretty optimistic there as well. What we’re seeing especially in terms of the Smart Phone segment growth we’re seeing increasing applications driving the density well up from where it was in the first half of 2008 which was more on the 1 gigabyte per system per phone, we’re seeing that, a lot of it driven by cost reasons and also by new applications driving across the 2 gigabyte so we think pretty heavy increase in density over 2009 from where we are today on the NAND and DRAM side. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: How about specifically on the notebooks including the net book impact.
Mark Adams : I think in the notebook segment we’re seeing that get more inline with the overall density, the overall desktop and notebook categories so we think that will be somewhat positive and the net book obviously given the application usage we think that’s also a fairly good market for us. The challenge for us there is trying to understand how big that market will be. We’ve seen estimates from 10% to 15% of the overall PC marketplace or even and then down as low as 5% of all notebooks. So the effect of that on the overall market size for us is challenging but still very positive for us.  
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Wong - Wachovia Capital Markets 
David Wong - Wachovia Capital Markets:  Do you expect your cash balances may drop to a level of which you will have to raise cash over the next few quarters and if so are there already any plans in the works for you to raise cash? Do you think you may have to raise cash at some time in the near future?
Steven Appleton : I don’t know how you define near future. We think our current cash balance will be in pretty good shape for a while. Whether we choose or not to raise any additional money depends on what happens in some of the markets. I think that one that Ronald pointed out or referenced is that we’re actually decreasing our debt levels. It was up a little bit because of the Inotera purchase and because we borrowed some money that was related to that purchase obviously from some players over there. So that increase took a really net net, if you think about the ongoing debt that we had prior to that purchase, we’ve been actually decreasing debt, not only did we [buy] the Japanese debt down but we’re not initiating any new debt regarding our typical ongoing equipment financing that we might normally do.  So I think that if the finance markets are more available moving into the next quarter or two I think you would expect us to see us continue to try to do more of that as we have in the past. Its not a change in our behavior, its just that we’ll continue to do that.  With respect to anything else which you might consider more strategic whether it be in partnership or whether we do something with any of these other areas where the governments are looking at putting money etc. I just don’t know right now. We’ll just have to wait and see what evolves over there but let me just say that we feel pretty good about where we’re at at the moment in our cash balance and so we’re just going to move forward and evaluate really what we want to do in terms of [inaudible] some of the more strategic things and you should expect us to move forward in the event that equipment financing normalizes that we’ll just probably continue to replace on an ongoing basis a lot of the debt that we’ve had. Its important to point out that that’s actually been decreasing. We’ve not been doing that in recent months. 
David Wong - Wachovia Capital Markets: Can you give us your weeks of finished goods inventory at the end of the quarter.
Ronald Foster : We’re looking at core DRAM in the two to three week range, specialty DRAM a little bit higher then that, NAND actually less then that and [edging] pretty close to the specialty DRAM area.  
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Manish Goyal - Kraft Investments 
Manish Goyal - Kraft Investments:  Your inventories declined quite rapidly in the current quarter and I was wondering how low can you take your inventories.
Ronald Foster : A couple of observations, our inventory went down in the current quarter both from good management of our total inventory and total units but also related to the net realizable value write-down that we had in the quarter. So both those effect our results as you’re looking dollar number on inventory. In terms of how far we can go down, I can tell you we got significant efforts going on to improve our working capital management, both in inventory and in other elements of working capital such as accounts receivable and you saw some of the results of that this last quarter with the improvement in operating cash flow which obviously is extremely important in these market times and tight financing times as Steven already commented on. So in terms of further improvement we do expect to get further improvement in our inventory management over time in FY09 going forward and I think we made good progress this last quarter even independent of the write-down of the NRV value.
Steven Appleton : So obviously we have what you would think of as inventory in the entire chain of operation, a lot of what Ronald is referencing and then we have inventory in terms of finished goods and clearly we’re trying to just get much more I think, much more precision around managing inventory that’s along the entire chain of operation but in addition to that, in terms of finished goods inventory that’s also had some improvement and I think, historically we have run what I would say probably about two weeks of inventory on hand is where we get uncomfortable in our ability to properly service the customer base. 
Mark Adams : For those of you who were on the fourth quarter 2008 earnings call, you recall that I mentioned that we kept some inventory in August to go into September to help support our module build up for finished goods into the holiday shipment schedule and obviously we don’t need that same level of inventory to support post holiday so I think that also contributed pretty favorably.  We did a good think in not trying to sell inventory in the spot market in late August. We carried it over to September and then we sold through to the channel and again helped put our finished good inventory in a much better position coming out of this quarter. 
Manish Goyal - Kraft Investments: What do you think your depreciation will be next quarter?
Ronald Foster : Its in the low $500 million range.
Manish Goyal - Kraft Investments: Why will depreciation, so if I’m looking at this number, so $594 includes amortization as well?
Ronald Foster : Yes, but you’ve got a 14-week quarter in Q1 going to a 13-week quarter in Q2 and we depreciate by week. 
Manish Goyal - Kraft Investments: So the February quarter number will be in low, so $520, is that a reasonable number to think about?
Ronald Foster : Yes, in that kind of range.
Manish Goyal - Kraft Investments: So just lastly if I look at your current quarter’s operating cash flow it was predominantly [inaudible] by working capital production especially inventory, and I just wonder how much more room is there to squeeze the working capital need and where we sort of in a quarter or so we end up running with negative operating cash flows.
Ronald Foster : Actually there were two elements, inventory which I already commented on and also trade accounts receivable which improved significantly, about $100 million. Other receivables related to I think like the Boise supply agreement that also were in that receivable number. So we had substantial improvement in our trade AR. In terms of how far we can go with that, we’ve actually been developing plans and modeling internally to drive our working capital down which is the driver of minimum cash requirements and we believe we’ve substantially improved our position already and will as we go through the year in terms of minimum cash requirements to support the operations of the business. I don’t have a specific construct for you but I think you can anticipate seeing improvements notably in the inventory category as I mentioned and continued focus in AR.  
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets 
Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets:  My question is more focused on the cost structure, how do you see yourselves comparing your cost in DRAM and NAND compared to the rest of the industry right now. It seems like last quarter you were thinking that you’re still one of the lowest cost in DRAM, can you just expand a bit where you think you stand in the roadmap for next year. 
Mark Adams : You have to be careful how you talk about costs. Obviously we have a pretty broad portfolio including some specialty parts and legacy parts and the cost per bit on those is not always going to be the best in the industry. But I think when you look at segment by segment what’s going on in the commodity space in both NAND and DRAM, we’re very comfortable with the process capability we have deployed and our ability to be at the leading edge relative to cost competitiveness.  So specifically when you look at NAND in 2009 Micron on a primarily 2 bit per [sell] 34-nanometer node versus the competitors something roughly 35% bigger, we think that’s going to drive a substantial gross margin advantage for Micron on a go forward basis.  On the DRAM side, moving to 50 nanometer as we already alluded to that’s the industry leading size there and we’ll additionally be layering in in the second half of the year additional low cost capacity from Inotera so we’re pretty happy with what we’ve got going on on the cost side and we think we’ll actually continue to make improvements on a relative basis. 
Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets: Where do you stand on 3 bit per sell in NAND and do you feel that your current 34 is basically cost competitive to the 3 bit that’s out there by some of your competitors. 
Mark Adams : Taking the second question first, yes we do. We think what we have out there is the most cost competitive offering. We haven’t seen anything in 34 nanometer 3 bit per sell from anyone. We have seen 56 and some samples of 43 but we think actually today those are really hitting just a very small piece of the marketplace and are really only capable of being a solution in a relatively small piece.  Now relative to Micron of course we have our own end bit per sell offering and those will be coming out on the leading edge 34 nanometer later in 2009 and at that point we believe that will be something that’s cost beneficial to Micron.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy – Thomas Weisel Partners
Kevin Cassidy – Thomas Weisel Partners: I was wondering if you can give a timeline on the Inotera ramp.
Mark Adams : By ramp by you mean Micron technology deployment in Inotera?
Kevin Cassidy – Thomas Weisel Partners: Right and when you start receiving the wafers.
Mark Adams : There’s two pieces really, there’s when does Micron transition so the wafers are [inaudible] to Micron and the other is the technology transition and in terms of the wafers transitioning to Micron that will happen on a graduated basis really over the next nine months so that by the time we get nine months out Micron will be taking its full share, 50% of the Inotera output. On the technology conversion which will of course drive some manufacturing efficiencies, that will be a second half of 2009 story really and we’ll continue to fine-tune that business plan per market conditions. 
Kevin Cassidy – Thomas Weisel Partners: Is that when you recognize the licensing fees, as the technology converts?
Mark Adams : Well we have a somewhat complicated relationship with our partners there and there are a couple of components to fee the transfers, as we’ve talked about in previous calls, some are more associated with the development cycle and those are ongoing and some are more associated with volume ramp and you would expect to see that portion of it increase more substantially as the volume begins to increase. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of [Daniel Barrenbaum – Unspecified Company]
[Daniel Barrenbaum – Unspecified Company]: Can you tell us what royalty revenue was in the quarter and can you maybe give us a bit of guidance for how that ramps recognizing that its complicated and there’s really some [change] in some licensing and some royalty and then on the CapEx can you breakout that full year CapEx by which project its going to and then can you also help us understand how much your partners are contributing to CapEx for 2009.
Ronald Foster : In terms of the royalty construct it was about $36 million in total royalties in Q1. Going forward that will be roughly the construct in terms of technology, license fees, etc. Then in addition, as Mark mentioned there will be the ramping of volume and that will be a percentage royalty base off of that flow of volume activity as we move out quarter by quarter so we don’t have a specific estimate of that piece. But the number this quarter is representative of the technology fees going forward, in that kind of ballpark. 
Mark Adams : As to the CapEx piece, think of it as roughly 40% high end flash, 20-25% the joint venture of [Tech] Semiconductor, and the remainder Micron. So of the high-end flash piece that’s really, there’s really two pieces to that. One is the completion of the manufacturing fab in Singapore, just the build out and set up of that fab.  And there’s a small amount of residual capital in 2009 there associated with the 34 and a couple of tools early into the next, the 2x node for NAND. Sorry on the flash piece that’s shared 50-50 or 51-49 with our partner.  On the tech piece that’s essentially 70% Micron, 30% partners and that’s really associated with the completion of the 68-nm transition and a small increment [for] 60-nm node. And then the Micron piece is pretty distributed dribs and drabs around some completion of 34-nm NAND and 50-nm DRAM at NTD as well as some [back end] facilities around the globe.
[Daniel Barrenbaum – Unspecified Company]: What do you expect depreciation and amortization to be for the full year.
Ronald Foster : Its roughly in the range I gave for Q2, $500 million quarter kind of range, low 500s. 
[Daniel Barrenbaum – Unspecified Company]: So running sort of $1.5 billion for the rest of the year on top of the nearly $600 million for Q1, is that the way to think about it.
Ronald Foster : Yes, just a little bit above that, closer to $2, including Q1. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann – Raymond James
Hans Mosesmann – Raymond James: Regarding the bit growth it was pretty strong and it seems that even if you assume the 14-week quarter you either gained market share or bit growth was a lot stronger from an industry perspective, can you give more clarity on what actually happened there.
Mark Adams : I think we absolutely feel positive about the share growth. I think there’s a couple of things that have gone on. As I mentioned earlier, one of which is we optimized where we were putting those bits coming into the quarter. Secondly I think we were able to drive more of that volume through our retail channel then we had initially planned which [throws] some of the bit growth. And finally as you look at both DRAM and NAND for us, we had some larger customers who came back and asked us for some additional share primarily due to our strength and position in the industry and where we were from a product availability perspective. So when you couple those three things with the focus from the operations perspective on the inventory management and driving some cash flow through that, for those efforts, I think its resulted in a pretty strong bit quarter for Micron. 
Hans Mosesmann – Raymond James: On the sensor business it was flat and that’s unusually strong too in this environment, are you gaining share or is it that you’re not exposed to some of the markets where perhaps they’re seeing a lot more weakness then you saw.
Steven Appleton : I think we did gain some share in the quarter but if you looked at some of the other forecasts and the competition, I think that’s indicative of what we’ll probably experience too. In other words I don’t think we’re going to escape the general economic decline and we would expect, and by the way its also the season of course is weaker, so we would expect for the what we call our Q2 or the calendar Q1 to be inline with what others are forecasting and it’ll be down for the quarter. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank Securities
Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank Securities: Can you remind us about the Inotera ramp also, what you’re planning in terms of the max capacity and how much you’re going to get. I think you mentioned its going to happen in about nine months, you’ll start to receive wafers in a significant way. 
Mark Adams : So first of all let me clarify we will start receiving wafers sooner then nine months, but by the end of nine months we will be taking our full 50% of the output. Now relative to capacity it’s a big fab and we think there’s a lot of room to optimize it on a go forward basis so current production is in the roughly 100,000 wafer per month range. We think that when optimized and transitioned to our technology that the fab is capable of supporting as much as 50% more then that.  And then if you layer in the Maya space on top it could, that site could clearly exceed 200,000 wafers per month. We don’t have plans to do that today. Our plan is in the second half of the year to transition or begin the transition to Micron’s technology without necessarily increasing output as we wait and see how the market conditions play out. 
Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank Securities: Its safe to say then even if your bits decline next quarter and maybe even lagged industry can catch up quite a bit once the Inotera capacity slides over to you. 
Mark Adams : Oh yes. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Unspecified Analyst 
Unspecified Analyst : Around CapEx, following up with Inotera given the weak pricing environment do you have any flexibility or do you want to have any flexibility in your plans with that Inotera transition to get that equipment moved over to the Micron process.
Ronald Foster : You mean in terms of either deferring or accelerating?
Unspecified Analyst : That is correct.
Steven Appleton : I think we have total flexibility, its just a matter of discussing what we’re going to do with our partners. I think the best way to think about the current state of the industry, its not just Micron, is that the entire situation is pretty fluid at the moment and you’ve obviously seen some of the announcements from a variety of other producers in the industry that they’re either slowing down for Christmas like we are or they’re actually doing capacity cuts. Most of the companies have already announced in the neighborhood of 20%, some 30%. Saw the recent [Heinex] announcement that we noticed in their press release that they were going to cut 30% of their capacity from January forward. All that of course is pretty fluid and will have an impact and I think that the rate at which things transition, or the rate at which capacity comes back online will all be determined on what the demand profile is when we do the first half of 2009.
Unspecified Analyst : And so having Qimonda taking part of the production from that Inotera fab that does not decrease your flexibility as far as you’re concerned. 
Steven Appleton : No, I don’t think so. 
Unspecified Analyst : Relative to Micron’s CapEx do you still see additional room to cut CapEx further in fiscal 2009 if you need to and then what is your perspective relative to the rest of the industry where they are at relative to rock bottom CapEx levels.
Steven Appleton : As has been the case historically there are only two companies that don’t react as dramatic as most of us do in the memory business, [inaudible] has been one of them although I think the [inaudible] guys will say that they’ve been substantially in the background in reducing their CapEx plans and then Intel is the other one and Intel, they tend to run on of course their own course in terms of what they do for little different reasons. And then other then that and particularly in the memory industry we don’t have, we really don’t want a lot of room for additional CapEx cuts is because essentially we’ve cut everything that costs could be cut and we’ve already spend half just in the first quarter.  I think that is the current state for most of the others at least in the memory industry and if you, really the guys to talk to are the equipment guys and if you talk to the equipment guys, they will tell you that they may not have any business in 2009 at least in certain categories and there’s certainly no expansion going on and will be, CapEx that gets spent in 2009 will be for cost reasons and I think short-term pay backs on improving their cost structure. I don’t think there’s going to be much else and at least that’s what I’ve been hearing from them. So I think that almost all companies at least in the memory industry are now approaching their minimum CapEx levels and I’ll tell you that I think that some of the forecasts that I’ve seen for CapEx at least attributed to memory for fiscal 2009 are still too high. I haven’t seen an estimate yet that’s probably going to be what it really ends up occurring in 2009.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Hsueh – Oppenheimer & Co.
Gary Hsueh – Oppenheimer & Co.: Bigger picture, bottom line could you help us explain the net effect of (a) the financial bailouts of [Comonda, Heinex] and potentially the Taiwanese DRAM companies and the (b) in near-term production cuts that most of these companies have mentioned. How does this shake out.
Steven Appleton : Its pretty tough to know with precision what happens and that’s predominantly because even though its probably relatively easy to calculate what comes out of the market from the capacity cuts based on the decisions that the companies have announced, its almost impossible to understand what the demand profile will look like and what the economic environment is going to be like in the next three to six months.  Now with that in mind, let me make two comments around what we see happening on the bailouts. Most of, in fact all, of the discussion around the bailouts coming from the various governments are around trying to provide what I would characterize as either one of two things, debt release so that they can defer debt retainment or immediate working capital needs because they frankly can’t even meet payroll if they don’t get something.  None of it is around expansion. None of it. None of it is around capacity additions, etc. its all around debt release or short-term working capital to stay out of bankruptcy and as a result, the bailouts of course to the extent that they occur will, may have a longer term effect in terms of those that otherwise would have exited the business but I don’t think they’re going to have much if any effect in terms of capacity being put into the marketplace any time in the next year, maybe probably next two years. This is a pretty big hole that the industry is in and in fact I’ve seen a couple of statistics now, if you were to just take the Taiwanese industry and talk about the difficulties they’re facing, essentially the total market cap of the companies is around $2.5 billion. The total debt of those same companies is around $12 billion and the cost just to convert to the [next] node is around $5 billion.  So that’s a [inaudible], that’s just a [darkened] characteristic of how things exist right now. So I think that you’ve got to keep that in mind when you think about what happens on the supply side. The capacity cuts that are taking place are absolutely going to have an effect and the bailouts aren’t going to do anything for new capacity coming into the market in the next year or two.  But what we can’t predict is the demand profile and how much that [inaudible] on the supply even though its the last [inaudible] that supply. 
Gary Hsueh – Oppenheimer & Co.: When you don’t get consolidation clearly you can’t really shed excess supply immediately so I think for DDR2 DRAM I think its going to be a pretty complex picture even in 2009, but if you look at DDR3 it’s a real opportunity here to kind of wipe the slate clean. There’s not too many companies out there as you said that can afford the R&D to move to DDR3, are economics given the pricing today of DDR3 today, are the economics in DDR3 attractive for Micron at this point or is the premium on DDR3 really not enough to offset higher manufacturing costs or larger die sizes.
Steven Appleton : Well clearly its attractive for us but I don’t think we can subscribe too much of a premium to it in the current environment but just to follow-up I absolutely believe there’s going to be consolidation. I made an earlier comment on the conference call that just because some of the bailouts are occurring that I think it would be a mistake to assume there’s not going to be consolidation.  I think in fact some of the bailouts are occurring just so that we can get to a consolidation otherwise the companies would be filing bankruptcy right now and I’m not really going to talk about the politics of that, negative or positive, its just a reality that we have to deal with.  But I don’t think that’s going to eliminate consolidation. I think that’s still going to happen. When you say wipe the slate clean on DDR3, there really only are a few of us that are capable of right now the technology in the marketplace. We have an advantage, we’re really an early ramper of DDR3 and becoming more and more a percent of our product line, but I don’t think its sufficiently over, add premium to that device, over what we’re having to deal with on the DDR2 or the DDR.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Unspecified Analyst 
Unspecified Analyst : You mentioned you have made no commitments to Inotera as far as CapEx I just wanted to understand for the transition that they are going to have to Micron’s memory is that conditional on them being able to get the financing to do that or do you expect that to be discussed later as you get closer to that.
Steven Appleton : Obviously the buyer at the moment was to have been able to finance their own transition to the technology. As Ronald noted we have remained [inaudible] in our commitments, CapEx commitments to Inotera at this point. No, I’ll just tell you it’s a little bit fluid. Clearly that industry and the government is talking about how they get those companies to the next generation of technology and Inotera is included in that group of companies. There are a couple of other models that are similar and we just don’t know. I think that the most important thing to note is that it, over time it will transition and the better capable it is to fund itself the better it is for us but, the partner, if we think it’s the best use of our dollars then we’ll look at doing that. But as of right now there hasn’t been any terms.

I would like to now turn the call over to Mr. Ron Foster.
Ronald C. Foster: To those listeners who haven’t seen our press release, which is available on our website and includes a reconciliation of the non-GAAP numbers discussed on this call, I will review the summary financial results for the fourth quarter, which ended August 28, 2008. Revenue decreased 3% and gross margin declined from 3% to (4%) in the fourth quarter, compared to the prior quarter, as megabit DRAM sales decreased and NAND ASP declines outpaced cost reductions. Both DRAM and NAND revenue declined sequentially while image sensor revenue increased.  The shut decline in ASPs during the last half of the fourth quarter triggered a $205.0 million lower of cost to market write-down in memory inventory to estimated market value. Excluding the inventory write-down DRAM margin improved again in the quarter as ASPs stayed relatively flat and cost reductions exceeded 5% in the quarter. NAND margins continued to be negative despite megabit cost reductions of approximately 15% in the quarter and ASPs declined about 20% in the same period. NAND gross margin benefited in the quarter from $70.0 million of contractual pricing adjustments from suppliers for products purchased in prior periods. Excluding the inventory write-downs and favorable NAND supplier adjustments, the company’s total gross margin for the quarter improved to 5%. The company recorded a net loss of $344.0 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, for the quarter compared to a loss of $236.0 million, or $0.30, in the prior quarter. For fiscal year 2008 revenue totaled $5.8 billion and the company reported a net loss of $1.6 billion, or $2.10 per diluted share. Gross margin was a negative $55.0 million in 2008 compared to $1.1 billion positive in 2007, as the memory product mix shifted significantly to NAND at a negative gross margin and memory cost reductions of about 65% did not keep pace with ASP declines of greater than 70% year-over-year. Results for 2008 reflect a non-cash charge of $463.0 million in the second quarter to write off good will associated with the memory segments. Progress in reducing our operating cost structure continued in the fourth quarter. SG&A declined 8%, mainly due to adjustments for performance-based compensation costs and legal fees. R&D expenses reflected ongoing cost management efforts and progress moving key development products into production. While controlling operating expenses will continue to be a high priority in fiscal 2009, the run rate will increase in the first quarter, due primarily to the anomaly of a 14-week first quarter. R&D expense of approximately $190.0 million to $200.0 million is expected for Q1 2009 with a run rate per quarter of $165.0 million to $175.0 million expected for the remainder of the year. SG&A of between $125.0 million to $130.0 million is expected for Q1 2009 followed by a run rate of approximately $110.0 million to $120.0 million per quarter for the remainder of 2009. Total head count was 23,509 for the quarter. Year-to-year, head count declined 3% with SG&A head count dropping 15%. Operating cash flow was $243.0 million for the fourth quarter, an increase from $144.0 million in the prior year’s quarter. Notably it was $1.0 billion for fiscal year 2008 compared to $937.0 million operating cash flow in fiscal year 2007. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash and short-term investments. Inventories declined $162.0 million in Q4 compared to the prior quarter, primarily as a result of the write-down of carrying value to estimated fair market value. During the fourth quarter TECH Semiconductor accessed $330.0 million of their credit line, increasing the company’s long-term debt to $2.5 billion from $2.2 billion in the previous quarter. Capital expenditures totaled $759.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 with approximately half of that amount attributable to 300 mm expansion at TECH. In addition, the company invested $84.0 million in its Maya partnership in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2008 were $2.9 billion compared to $4.1 billion in 2007. Partners’ contributions toward capital expenditures were approximately 20% of the 2008 total. TECH accounted for about 34% of capital expenditures in 2008 as it completed its 300 mm conversion. IMFT was 25%, IMFS 17% for their fab construction, and 24% for all the other Micron operations. Anticipated capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 have been revised downward to approximately $1.0 billion to $1.3 billion for the year. Partners are expected to contribute about 15% of this amount. We have officially delayed the IMFS fab build-out and removed tool installs from our fiscal 2009 capital plan. We will continue to evaluate market conditions to determine the exact timing and the amount of capital commitments for IMFS. Micron’s projected cap-ex in 2009 includes research and development costs and node transitions for the Manassas ramp to 54 nanometer DRAM technology. TECH’s expenditures include continued 300 mm conversion costs and the transition to 68 nanometer DRAM technology. IM flash expenditures reflect the transition to 34 nanometer NAND technology at Lehi. $466.0 million remains in capital contributions committed to our Maya JV through calendar year 2009. The specific timing of this investment, as well as the amounts and timing of projected capital expenditures for fiscal 2009, will be driven in part by market conditions, in consultation with our partner. Depreciation and amortization expense was $2.1 billion in fiscal 2008 and is expected to be about $2.25 billion for 2009. With that I will close there and turn the commentary over to Mark Adams.
Mark W. Adams: During Q4 we continued to see signs of industry over-supply in both the DRAM and NAND flash memory markets. As a result, we have been experiencing increasing ASP pressure in both our DRAM and NAND businesses. Computing continues to be Micron’s largest overall market segment. While PC desktop systems have shown some signs of weakening demand going into the holidays, the notebook segment continues to be strong. Although we do not have direct insight into the specific demand drivers, we continue to see an increase in memory content for systems. In addition, we are seeing a growing demand for our DDR3 memory products and expect wide adoption across computing platforms through the end of the year and throughout 2009. Despite tough market conditions, we see additional opportunity at keeping customers, given our technology leadership and strong relative financial position. Our specialty DRAM product offering remained strong in Q4. We are leveraging our existing 200 mm fabs to provide a majority of specialty DRAM products. Going forward, we are selectively moving higher volumes of specialty DRAM products to 300 mm facilities to achieve further cost reductions and allow for supply growth. Beyond the demand from our computing customers, the mobile market experienced tremendous growth for us in Q4. We saw increasing unit shipments in our lower-powered DRAM products, we grew our sales in multi-chip packages to key handset partners, and additionally, with the launch of our 50 nanometer 8 gigabit MLC part, we began shipment of Micron’s first [migressing] memory chart. Clearly Micron is very well positioned with a broad array of products that address the needs of our mobile customer base. Overall the NAND market continues to be in an oversupply condition. Given the flash memory market is driven largely by consumer applications such as MP3, digital cameras, GPS systems, and mobile phones, the business is highly seasonal. The forecast signals from our major OEMs and retailers suggest a softening demand heading into the holiday shopping season. We are hopeful that price elasticity will help the current industry inventory situation as we exit the holidays and approach 2009 where we expect industry supply growth to slow substantially. Our technology and skill advances in flash memory, highlighted by industry-leading 34 nanometer technology, will have a positive effect on cost reductions, however the oversupply and market conditions have driven today’s prices below fully-loaded costs. As we have successfully accomplished the development of our premium DRAM segments, we are focused on striking our NAND product portfolios to improve our ASPs and overall competitive position.  We are growing a shipment of Micron NAND output through the Lexar channel in an effort to achieve higher ASPs and margins by leveraging the Lexar brand and growing detailed channel presence. In fact, while many of our retail competitors are experiencing sharp declines in tacked on revenue, our Lexar channel grew their sales in the face of these dramatic NAND price shuts. On the product front, we continue our development of enterprise cross solid state drives and have begun testing at key OEM customers. Initial customer feedback has been positive. Despite the over-supply conditions in DRAM and NAND, we remain optimistic about our continued success in specialty DRAM product segments and about our ability to improve our cost position in the commodity DRAM, as well as continued development into a diversified flash memory product portfolio. In the meantime, however, we are hopeful recently announced cap-ex cuts in the industry will begin to improve the supply situation as we move forward. We continue to lead the industry from the technology perspective and [inaudible] our position in growth position and profitability as the industry reaches stability in terms of supply [inaudible]. With that, I will hand it back over to Kipp.
Kipp A. Bedard: We would now like to take questions from callers. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first questions comes from Tim Luke - Barclays Capital.
Tim Luke – Barclays Capital: We would be grateful if you could just give us some sense, as you look forward, of what sort of bit growth you might be envisioning going into the November period, and DRAM and the NAND. And just off the current quarter-to-date level, if prices remain flat how should we think about your assumptions on pricing.
Kipp A. Bedard: I will take the first part of that and then turn the pricing question over to Mark.  For DRAM we’re looking at the next couple of quarters being in the mid-to-high teens for production bit growth. And NAND, although it will be somewhat lumpy from time to time, we are going to be averaging around 15% quarter-to-quarter growth over the next couple of quarters.
D. Mark Durcan: On the pricing front, our DRAM ASPs are down about 15% to 20% quarter-over-quarter and on the NAND front, quarter-over-quarter is down about 30% to 35%. I would like to clarify that coming out of Q4 where we saw dramatic price pressure on the NAND front, it has been relatively stable in most of September. And ironically, the DRAM piece, while down 15% to 20% quarter-over-quarter, we’ve seen [inaudible] pressure on that in that time frame.
Tim Luke – Barclays Capital: And could you give us some kind of framework for different inputs as to how we should think about your gross margin development going forward?
Ronald C. Foster: While we won’t try to predict pricing for you, on the cost guidance we are looking at DRAM probably in the high single digits to low double digits, cost reductions Q-to-Q and we will probably have a little stronger NAND bit cost reduction, so look more for the mid-to-high teens for this quarter.
Tim Luke – Barclays Capital: And just as you begin this full year, could you give us some sense of how you’re looking now, assumptions for the bit growth for the industry in DRAM and in NAND, given different puts and takes in terms of basic consolidation as well as production sort of cut backs by some of your peers.
Steven R. Appleton: I obviously have to make commentary with the caveat that I don’t know if we have yet seen the end of operations coming off line. But from the sense with what’s been known so far, I think that most people think that the DRAM supply base growth is only going to be somewhere in the 35% to 40% neighborhood. But that’s with things that haven’t been announced yet. And I still think there will be more to be announced in the next probably two to three months. So, I would say that I haven’t seen capacity come off line in this short a period of time at the rate that we’re seeing these announcement right now and I think that we are likely to see in the next month or two, maybe in my history of being in this business. So there are some pretty dramatic changes going on.  So I think if what we know is in the market today is what it ends up being, I think that the bit growth will drop all the way, most people are forecasting it will drop all the way to a kind of 35% to 40% range and it could be less than that. As I said, making the caveat that I still think there is more capacity coming off line.
Tim Luke – Barclays Capital: Do you have the sense for NAND as well?
Steven R. Appleton: If you think about NAND, obviously there has been less impact there. Of course, there are less producers. The NAND market cap-ex, as you already know, at least in 2008, is going to be down sequentially, which is essentially, I think, the first time that’s happened since the inception of the market. And the NAND supply, at least that we see from a lot of the forecasts, is only going to grow somewhere around 100%. And that’s the lowest on record, I think, for the NAND market since its inception.
Tim Luke – Barclays Capital: You have that $1.0 billion to $1.3 billion of cap-ex, where is that going to be focused and what are the implications for your JV with Intel with the lower cap-ex number?
Steven R. Appleton: I think it is worth noting that, first of all, primarily that cap-ex will be in the DRAM arena. But remember, as Ron just noted, the IMF fabs, we are finishing out the construction of the building but essentially we now don’t plan on having that equipped during our fiscal 2009.  But the operations that are currently running on NAND, if you think about, both the Virginia operation and the Utah operation, are pretty new and so I don’t think that they are going to require a lot of cap-ex in the next year, going forward. And that’s why most of it is skewed to the DRAM business.
Operator: Your next question comes from Uche Orji - UBS.
Uche Orji - UBS: Can you just give us an update on a couple of issues with the litigation situation. One is where do you stand and what the upcoming dates for trials? And then regarding the equipment lead time, what are you seeing on the markets in terms of how much cap-ex you plan to spend and how flexible will you be with that cap-ex plan?
Steven R. Appleton: On RAM [inaudible] we don’t have any comment on ongoing litigation. And most of the schedules and what judges have already decided or what the trial schedule is that are public, we can get that information. So we don’t really have anything to add on that. With respect to the equipment lead time, obviously they started contracting as cap-ex is being cut around the industry. I think that is expected. And in most cases most of us thought that they were somewhere in the 6-9 month, even as long as 12 months, depending on what you were going to order. And most of that is contracted in probably the 3-4 month time frame, depending on what it is. But having said that, I think it’s also worth noting that the equipment industry has for the most part changed to a model of outsourcing. And when we get in periods of time like we are right now, they just simply cut back on the outsourcing and a lot of that capacity goes away and is not replaceable for the short period of time. So that would obviously be one of the concerns for the industry. If they were to try to bring it back up quickly, I think that a lot of these equipment guys now that the downturn has been sustaining are making permanent adjustments in their supply base. And most of them, as I said, converted over to a model of outsourcing. So it could very well be that even a slight uptick in cap-ex will extend those lead times.
Uche Orji - UBS: With regards to what you see in regards of content, as we see more and more of the PC market move toward [inaudible] and the effects of things like notebooks taking off, what does that mean for you in terms of the content growth in the medium term and the long term?
Steven R. Appleton: If you look at the data today, actually, it’s continued to go the opposite trend. As a matter of fact, this is the first quarter that both our desk top and the notebook content in the industry is over 2 gigabyte per unit. And beyond that, we are kind of in a wait-and-see until the notebook [inaudible] overall impact on the industry. Unit volume, they are kind of just barely starting out today. Secondly, in addition to when you talk about [inaudible] notebook it might look like a probably down-size in the DRAM turns into an opportunity for solid state technology on the NAND side. So we’re pretty excited about that category in general and we don’t think it’s [inaudible] right now in the next 12-24 months in the unit perspective in the overall units.
Uche Orji - UBS: So you don’t think it’s maxed out just year. The last part, did you say it was [inaudible] for the next 12-18 months?
Steven R. Appleton: I think that’s probably about right. And clearly right now it’s not material. We don’t see that going through the, as far as out as 12-24 months in terms of a overall capacity in the industry. As I said, there’s an upside opportunity on the forward side of that because they’re going out in many cases without hard drives, which storage will be an internal drive.
Uche Orji - UBS: We are seeing a lot of your competitors struggle and things are getting more difficult. Can you just talk as to how you view your role in this market place and from your perspective what will it take to play a much more active role?
Steven R. Appleton: As you just noted, you can look at the numbers like we’re looking at them. Most of the companies, particularly in DRAM space, have migrated to balance sheet preservation. The margins, the numbers, the cash flows, etc. for a couple of those in the industry are just absolutely very, very challenging, I think, for them.  And I don’t want to comment consolidation of the industry other than to say that the market environment like it is right now is just putting huge pressure on some of the competitors in this state and I think they are trying to figure out what kind of course they really have in the future.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Pitzer - Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: A couple of qualifications first. Relative to the $70.0 million recovery for NAND products purchased from other suppliers, is that all Lexar-related? Or can you help me understand that a little bit?
Steven R. Appleton: Yes, that’s Lexar-related.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: And then secondly, you talked a little bit about SSDs. Have you guys actually recognized any revenues relative to the SSDs? And help me understand how we should think about this market developing over the next several quarters. At what point do you think it might actually be 5% to 10% of your NAND sales?
Mark W. Adams: Today the revenue is fairly small in the category, for us, on the Micron side. Mind you, our strategy has been to kind of develop a world-class enterprise offering as we went in and tested, as I mentioned earlier, with some of our key customers. As it relates to kind of a forward-looking market projection, it’s pretty tough, although I will tell you that given the trends in the ASP demand, it’s starting to make that curve [inaudible] come in a little bit. The cost per gigabyte today, what we thought 12 months ago, seems to be a little bit more aggressive in terms of price adoption.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: And just relative to your cap-ex budget for the current fiscal year, can you help me understand, you drew down some lines of credit in the fiscal fourth quarter. Can you walk through the different lines of credit you have? Do you expect that your cash flow generation, over the next several quarters, is going to be sufficient to support cap-ex? Do you think we will continue to see cash balances come down? Can you help us understand the strength of the balance sheet here?
Ronald C. Foster: If you look at our current operating cash flow generation, it’s around $240.0 million a quarter, we generated $1.0 billion in 2008, of operating cash flow. That’s probably one of the top in the industry. And if you look at our cap-ex budget going forward, just at our current operating cash flow rates, we can pretty well cover our cap-ex budget. The only thing I would comment on is that our cap-ex requirements are somewhat flexible, in terms of time, and we will be monitoring the market as we go forward. So you can see our positioning in terms of investments, and specifically cap-ex moves, being developed over time based upon the requirements that we see in the marketplace.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Just relative to being opportunistic around consolidation,, given the current state of the industry, your balance sheet, your capital requirements that you’re putting up, cap-ex requirements that you are putting up for the fiscal year, how much flexibility do you have to be opportunistic? And I guess the question mark in the market place is what happens to Tera. I guess you guys can’t comment given that you have a joint venture with Nanya at the same time that Nanya is trying to figure out what to do with their joint venture with Komando, that might be helpful, especially as far as trying to figure out when Maya might go ahead as far as equipment loading.
Ronald C. Foster: I wanted to just back up real quick. You asked a questions about the lines of credit. I just wanted to make sure that I clarify. TECH Semi, which is obviously majority-owned by us, we have other partners in Singapore, that is where the line of credit was drawn. It wasn’t at Micron at the parent-level, so to speak. And that was a line of credit that they had put in place in order to do the 300 mm conversion. We haven’t done anything other than that in terms of drawing that line of credit. With respect to your question around what’s our flexibility, clearly we have some flexibility. We’re probably one of the best positioned now in the industry with respect to our financials and I have said in the past that we will continue to look at these opportunities as they surface. We don’t have any [inaudible] today but we’re continuing to keep a pretty close eye on what’s going on in the market place.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: If you look at the quarter just reported, DRAM bits were down sequentially. If you look at the guidance for bit production growth, you are looking for mid-to-high teens. Given that all the data points relative to the PC [inaudible] it has probably gotten weaker since Labor Day. Help me understand why you’re not more concerned about that DRAM portion.
Steven R. Appleton: I’m not sure, quite, what your question was.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: In a quarter where the PC data points were actually relatively okay, your August-ending quarter, you had DRAM bit growth that was actually negative Q-on-Q and now you’re talking about the bit production. I know it’s two different things going up, sort of mid-teens, in an environment where the data points around PCs seem to be getting weaker, not stronger. So I’m just trying to understand that dynamic a little bit.
Steven R. Appleton: First of all, when you think bit growth, in terms of our production, obviously the bit growth, we are advancing our technology and converting, if you will, TECH to 300 mm and that is resulting in the big growth, and frankly, that’s going to be whatever it is because we are optimizing the operation [inaudible] cost per bit. Now with respect to what we’re seeing in the market place, as Mark already noted, clearly the PC business was plugging along pretty well and then also was noted really in the last month the demand profile has really dropped off. And we don’t know if that is going to be sustained but clearly I think that the PC OEMs felt like they had enough inventory, that they didn’t want to carry more inventory as they moved into the holiday season, thinking this holiday will likely be weak. But I think that what we’re talking about in terms of bit growth, that’s based on an internal operation that we control and we’re trying to optimize the cost per bit. When we’re talking about the bit demand growth that is occurring in the market place, I think most of it is more like the demand that will occur, primarily will occur beyond the quarter one calendar of 2009.
Operator: Your next question comes from James Covello - Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: A couple of things, sort of derivations of questions that have already been asked. We’ve spent a lot time asking about DRAM consolidation. Obviously there is a pretty important piece of NAND consolidation that is out there in terms of Samsum having announced an offer for SanDisk. Can you help us understand, to the extent that it was, and the consolidation of Nanya, that specific piece of consolidation, how do you think that would affect the industry dynamics, other than from market share, supply to world containments amongst the various parties in the industry.
Steven R. Appleton: Well, I don’t want to speak for other companies, but first of all I think the consolidation that is occurring in NAND, you have to look at it at two different levels. SanDisk is not a producer of NAND components, they are a minority partner in a company that actually is a producer of NAND components, and we all know that that is Toshiba. So in terms of Samsum potentially acquiring SanDisk, obviously I don’t have any insight as to whether that will or will not happen. I can only say that that is a consolidation, if you will, of the channels, it’s not a consolidation of NAND component production.  Having said that, there has clearly been conferrals. We’ve been part of those announcements as well as some contractions around 8-inch NAND and I think you will see additional contraction as we move forward, in particular on the 8-inch front. So I think more likely in the NAND space, I mean there’s really only four of us that produce it at the component level, more likely the NAND space at the component level, it’s really us and others either deferring expansion or taking off line a sufficient production capacity.  But in terms of the channel, I think that’s where you will probably see consolidation as these companies try to position themselves or create better links to solve whatever their own particular issues are.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: One other follow-up questions around the solid state drive adoption, where is the industry at this point in multi-level cell controllers and has that really been the gating factor in your mind since the one thing, you know, further penetration in solid state drives, obviously prices need to come down and prices are coming down but that’s been a little bit of a gating factor. Where do you think Micron and the industry is on that?
Mark W. Adams: I think if you divide the market segments up into enterprise and PC/notebook, you get a different set of requirements to compete for the existing applications. On the notebook side, which will probably drive most of the MLC-based solid state drives, there actually has been some fairly good progress around controllers in that environment. So I think, as I said, given the price trending and the declines over the recent quarter, we’re starting to get to a point where the solid state drive application notebooks is increasingly becoming more attractive from an end user’s perspective. On the enterprise side, I don’t think we’re in a place where we are mostly in control of development if you’re even in a position to compete for that space. You’ve got a whole set of different requirements around reliability, performance, and so on and so forth, where it’s still a chameleon SLC market and that’s where our control will kind of evolve in the short term.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: I think Steve talked about potentially 35% to 40% DRAM bit supply growth in 2009 but it could be lower if we see additional stuff come off line and maybe 100% NAND supply bit growth in 2009. Did I get those figures right?
Steven R. Appleton: That’s right.
Operator: Your next question comes from Shawn Webster - JP Morgan.
Shawn Webster - JP Morgan: What was your DRAM production in Q4, sequentially, as well as your NAND?
Ronald C. Foster: It was up mid-teens on DRAM and NAND was up low-double digits.
Shawn Webster - JP Morgan: So somewhere between 10% to 20%?
Ronald C. Foster: Correct.
Shawn Webster - JP Morgan: And as far as production for next year, you couched it in terms of what you believe the industry will do. Does Micron plan to outgrow the industry in either or both of DRAM and the NAND segments next year, in terms of production?
Ronald C. Foster: Well, we stayed away from a year-over-year guidance for you because there is flexible and flexibility within our production plan. So we have given you a taste of what we think we will do the next couple of quarters, but there is too much flexibility for us to give you a year-over-year number for Micron.
Shawn Webster - JP Morgan: What are the available lines of credit that your company has, both directly for Micron, as well as all of your subsidiaries, in terms of how much credit you have available to tap?
Ronald C. Foster: We historically, as I already mentioned first of all, that TECH is the entity that has used lines of credit historically and they used those prior to us being the majority owner back when we were a minority partner. And also after we acquired the majority of the shares. So they continue to do that. They use lines of credit, they draw and they pay back. They’ve been doing that for the decade that we’ve been involved with them. Other than that, Micron doesn’t actually draw on lines of credit. And we have philosophically came to the conclusion that a lot of people are experience right now, that if you need the money and you can’t get it, and then you don’t need it and you can get all you want, so we have relied on our own cash balances. And that’s why you continue to see us have a strong cash balance is because we don’t have lines of credit that we’ve drawn on. So we haven’t drawn on any because we don’t use that form of financing.
Shawn Webster - JP Morgan: But do you have any that are available to you?
Ronald C. Foster: No. We don’t have any lines of credit that are in place. In terms of what we’ve always looked at for available financing is either to do strategic partnerships, which we’ve done a fair amount over the last ten to fifteen years, or by going to the market.
Shawn Webster - JP Morgan: In terms of the write down, can you break it out for us between the NAND and DRAM segments? The $205.0 million.
Ronald C. Foster: We don’t break down between those two segments. It’s actually a product-by-product analysis that’s done and we relate that to our pricing forecast on a line item basis. So I don’t have the break down that way. In view of us just going through our line items and comparing it to our forecast of near-term future prices, and obviously that’s a judgment call based upon what we’re seeing, or anticipating, in front of us, on a line item basis.
Shawn Webster - JP Morgan: I think someone mentioned earlier an expectation for pricing. Can I just check those number? I think for November if pricing stays flat for DRAM you said down 15% to 20%, is that correct?
Ronald C. Foster: If flat from here, that’s correct.
Shawn Webster - JP Morgan: And then 30% to 35%?
Ronald C. Foster: Yes. Again, if flat from here.
Shawn Webster - JP Morgan: How much were your Nanya licensing royalties in the quarter?
Ronald C. Foster: I believe that was $34.0 million for the quarter.
Shawn Webster - JP Morgan: And is that the kind of run rate you expect for the next several quarters?
Ronald C. Foster: As we have explained in the past, there are two line items for that. There’s the licensing, which is more straight-line amortized through calendar 2010. And then there is a royalty-as-production-ramps. So as the Nanya production ramps and/or Maya ramps, then you will see an increase in the royalty line, based on the output that they receive.
Shawn Webster - JP Morgan: And the $34.0 million hits the revenue line right?
Ronald C. Foster: Correct.
Shawn Webster - JP Morgan: What was your wafer growth, sequentially, in the August quarter?
Ronald C. Foster: It was about 1%.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Co.
Gary Hsueh – Oppenheimer & Co.: Just circling back to another question, you say that you grew bit production for DRAM in the fiscal fourth quarter by the mid-to-high teens. You basically kind of print a sales kind of bit number quarter-over-quarter of down 5%. So at what point does it make sense, even in fiscal Q1, to continue to produce bits in the mid-to-high teens? At what kind of DRAM contract or spot pricing level does it make sense to actually start cutting production, given the discrepancies between bit production and bit sales?
Steven R. Appleton: Well, the way that we do our analysis, first of all, Gary, cash is king in this environment. So if we are able to generate cash from an operation, clearly that plays a primary role in how we look at it as opposed to the way that you’re describing it. So as long as we are generating positive cash flow with an operation, we are going to considering continuing to keep it on line. Now, having said that, the reverse is true as well. As soon as an operation looks like it’s no longer generating cash, is actually consuming cash, then we’re going to look at should we remove that or take that off line. But remember, that is all these numbers, as Ron just described, deals with forecast and historical-looking data so we want to make sure that we’re not making a short-term decision that is going to hurt us in the long term. And I will tell you, it’s an ongoing evaluation right now, given the market conditions.
Ronald C. Foster: And one of the points on that is that going into the end of August, we had some key customer requirements that forced us to take some of the inventory from our August quarter and early September for holiday deliveries and that put us in a position where the shipments were not in line with the output.
Gary Hsueh – Oppenheimer & Co.: So there is a bit of a timing issue in terms of your bit production and actual bits shipped in the quarter?
Ronald C. Foster: That’s right, when you think about it and you look at the volatility in the pricing in the last two weeks of August, when we did our calculation from a financial model, it would have made a lot more sense to carry the inventory over for some opportunities that we needed from a linearity perspective into the Q1 of our fiscal year.
Gary Hsueh – Oppenheimer & Co.: And just so I’m clear here in terms of bit sales growth in the fiscal first quarter, I should be expecting something above a down 5% quarter last quarter, right? I mean, given the lower pricing, down 15% to 20%, presumably with elasticity, you can start shipping, or pushing through more bits, is that the thinking here?
Ronald C. Foster: Given where we are today, that’s our plan. Again, not knowing what the future holds on pricing and so on and so forth.
Gary Hsueh – Oppenheimer & Co.: The second question is just on bit cost reduction. I think you’ve been putting up some pretty disciplines numbers in terms of stepping down, the cost of goods sold per bit. Is there a kind of an end of the line here, or kind of plateau, where you can’t continue [inaudible] bit cost reduction? Where are we relative to that point?
Mark W. Adams: I don’t think that’s the case, as Kipp alluded earlier. Our bit growth and our cost per bit will be a little bit lumpy, on a go-forward basis. But we continue to say high single digits, low teens, on DRAM and mid-teens on NAND, on a go-forward basis, and we think that’s good for a number of quarters going forward.
Gary Hsueh – Oppenheimer & Co.: The mark on average, you still see the ability to kind of consistently push down along those kind of bit cost reduction numbers, over the next four quarters?
Mark W. Adams: Absolutely. We think we have got a great technology road map and we’ve got good capacity in place and we’re pretty comfortable with the technology and capital decisions we made as we put that capacity in place.
Gary Hsueh – Oppenheimer & Co.: Just to kind of help me frame 2009, a lot of discussion on consolidation, production cuts, but top-level, which line of business, DRAM, NAND, or specialty or image sensor, which line of business do you think you could see a recovery first, and which business has the highest kind of leverage to the upside in the event of any kind of recovery here in the back half of 2009?
Steven R. Appleton: If I were to try to rate that for you, and I will give it a shot, first of all, we’ve already seen the imaging business have a pretty decent gross margin and they’ve actually been up quarter-over-quarter, so I don’t know if we want to characterize that as a recovery, but so far so good on that as they move forward. The specialty DRAM, I don’t think we expect much of a recovery because it’s already pretty good business, but I do think that we expect that the volume will decline as we move through time over the next couple of years. Now, having said that about those two categories, my perspective, given what I’m seeing in the DRAM market versus the NAND market, I think that a lot of people feel like the DRAM business is going to recover sooner than the NAND business may recover, and I think that would be reflective, by the way, of what you see in the cap-ex. So, when you look at the DRAM business today, it just doesn’t feel like for many companies it’s sustainable. Many of them are below their cash cost, they have moved into balance sheet preservation. It’s a very, very difficult environment. And also it’s worth noting that there are weaker players that exist in the DRAM business compared to the NAND business because if you look at those that are really producing NANDs it is essentially Samsum, Micron, Toshiba and obviously we are major players in both spaces. So, that’s just how I see it playing out.  On the NAND front it’s just hard for me to respond because I don’t know how long it takes for a lot of the capital pushes or whatever capacity has come off line to be a factor. In particular, when you look at the demand growth rates, obviously NAND far exceeds DRAM so this is one of those periods of time where NAND has a lot of price elasticity. I mean more price elasticity than DRAM and it’s behaving a lot more like the DRAM business did in pre-1995 around that elasticity, so it’s much harder to predict when that market might turn as opposed to what we’re seeing in the DRAM business.
Operator: Your next question comes from Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets.
Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets: Just a question on the image sensor business. Can you comment a bit on the visibility there, what you’re seeing there in terms of growth for the next couple of quarter, if at all? And kind of what the strategy is now for the segment?
Steven R. Appleton: I wouldn’t say there’s a lot of growth. I think it looks pretty stable. I would say not a lot of growth, not a lot of decline. There are some incremental improvements that we’re making. If you would have noticed, for image sensor companies, they’ve made somewhat of a comeback and I think have gained some market share in the last quarter or two.  But, hey, look, I think that business, a lot of it is in the mobile stage and the technology stage, if you will, around PDAs and digital cameras and PC cams, etc. so I think we have some similar challenges to what other segments do, but it still looks like they’re on a pretty good path. In terms of what we’re intending to do in that space, there hasn’t been any change of plans with respect to what’s happening with that Aptina. In fact, on this Friday they will start operating as a separate company from Micron, although it will be a wholly-owned subsidiary they will have their own systems and so forth, and we’re still moving down the path as journey with a partner to likely take that company and try to work, but yet have Micron continued to manufacture the product, at least in the foreseeable future.
Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets: And on the Nanya partnership, can you just expand a bit, what the plan is in terms of cap-ex rollout there for the next year, with the partnership. I mean what quarters should we see it, what’s the road map right now?
Ronald C. Foster: If you look at our Maya partnership, what we’ve decided at this point is that in light of current business conditions, we’re deferring any near-term capital purchases as we re-assess our near-term business plans with our partner. It is important to note that that is affecting near-term timing and we remain very committed to our partnership. The only issue we are dealing with is the actual timing of our planned expansion. These are the market demand and our judgment about timing. We still have a $466.0 million commitment out there for the calendar year but we will judge the timing of that based upon market needs.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Wong - Wachovia.
David Wong - Wachovia Capital Markets: First a quick clarification. You said that demand had dropped off in the last month. Do you mean the last month of the quarter that is August or did you mean in September? And are you expecting continued weakness in demand through the rest of this year to only pick up in the first quarter? You made some comments about potentially a pick up in the first quarter.
Steven R. Appleton: What we saw primarily was ASP price pressure due to the demand in the August time frame and continued, again, more on the DRAM front, through September. On a going-forward basis it’s hard to tell but it looks like it’s going to be a softer holiday than initially hoped.
David Wong - Wachovia Capital Markets: And you’re 5% drop in DRAM bit shipment, is that indicative of what PC makers as a whole bought from the DRAM industry or is there something special associated with Micron that you had a different characteristic from the market as a whole?
Steven R. Appleton: As I commented earlier, the volatility in pricing the last couple of weeks of August had us kind of reflect on what was the best thing to do financially for the inventory to be sold and we looked at some key customer requirements in the early part of September that we decided to hold over in support.
Operator: Your next question comes from Doug Freedman - Amtech Research.
Doug Freedman - American Technology Research: Can you comment on what you’re expecting PC unit growth to look like in the last quarter of the year?
Steven R. Appleton: For us it’s a little bit harder than the demand side given what I just commented on and the softening of demand. But certainly from a unit standpoint, the growth is going to be, our current assumptions going into the quarter were somewhere modest, sub-10%. And at this point, given the economic and macro economic situation and the holiday projection that we now see, somewhere about flat to up or down a few percent.
Doug Freedman - American Technology Research: Can you also comment as far as the bits that you shipped in the Lexar retail, the percentage of bit? You’ve given that number in past.
Steven R. Appleton: In terms of flash components, Lexar ended up consuming about 50% to 55% of their overall needs. As it relates to Micron overall supply on NAND, it continues to approach about 20% of the overall supply of Micron parts.
Doug Freedman - American Technology Research: One of the previous callers touched on going back to market dynamics out there. What was the demand in DRAM, we saw some pretty heavy promotions in the past 2-3 months regarding to box loading and trying to use DRAM to load up some boxes and make some unit moves and entice customers, working towards price elasticity. Can you comment on what you’re presently seeing and what maybe the promotion plans are around the holidays and whether we still really have price elasticity, both in the NAND market and in the DRAM market, for general purpose PC marketing.
Steven R. Appleton: That’s a pretty tough question given the situation from what we see today. Historically we go into the Black Friday season in retail and we’re trying to drive traffic and so on and so forth and use the price to get people in the store and have them buy upsale margin opportunity while they’re in the store. I think to your point, the pricing situation is so dramatic up until today, that we see that the retail actually has a choice of keeping that margin and not driving the top line and we have seen that in years past, in general in the market, where retailers take the, where the economic climate is not so favorable, and they take the margin as opposed to taking the top line revenue growth. So I think I kind of concur with where you were heading with that, I’m not sure the price will be a useful tool, an effective tool, to drive additional unit sales. And they may choose to play a margin gain coming into the holidays.
Operator: Your next question comes from Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities.
Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities: What do you see in terms of consumer versus corporate PC demand?
Steven R. Appleton: On the desk top side we have seen a bit more of a decline. The notebook side is relatively strong, even through the consumer channel. But if I segment out, as you’ve asked about consumer and commercial, the commercial, the commercial business is still pretty good for us and we’re just starting to see the consumer side of the desk top and some small decline overall in the PC space in the consumer side. But again, the enterprise commercial side is fairly stable for us so far.
Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities: Can you give us an update on inventory of flash memory cards in the channel, what is the situation in terms the inventory excesses that we saw in flash cards during [inaudible]?
Steven R. Appleton: I think our public competitors have already stated their position and it’s pretty significant. Vis-à-vis Micron and through the Lexar channel, I think we’ve got a pretty good handle on that, as well as we’ve won some additional share going into the holiday to offset any problems I think we have in the channel inventory of our business. My sense is, to the earlier reflection on what the retailer tools will be to drive unit and overall volume in the stores for the holiday, the question will be better answered coming out of the holiday in mid-January.
Operator: Your next question comes from Manish Goyal - Kraft Investments.
Manish Goyal - Kraft Investments: Based on your new cap-ex guidance, what is your depreciation for fiscal 2009? And can you give us some sense as to what percent of your production today is at 200 mm for DRAM and NAND separately, and over what period of time do you see that will be decommissioned?
Ronald C. Foster: The depreciation for 2009, we’re estimating to be about $2.25 billion. On a $200.0 million a year output it’s less than 10% on core DRAM and 5% to 10% on NAND.
Manish Goyal - Kraft Investments: And over what period do you see decommissioning that capacity?
Steven R. Appleton: I think the specialty and imager wafers are still very productive for us. And we have some flexibility in terms of how we move wafers around. Clearly NAND and core DRAM production is challenged on 200 mm today, it’s not as efficient as the 300 mm. but it is a fully depreciated tool set and we can flex, so we will just continue to look at market conditions and maybe adjust them as we go forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bob Gujavarty - Duetsche Bank.
Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank Securities: What was your DDR3 mix? Was it appreciable in this quarter?
Ronald C. Foster: We did a couple of percent of DDR3 in this quarter.
Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank Securities: 1% to 3%, something like that?
Ronald C. Foster: Correct.
Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank Securities: And are you still on track for your 34 nanometer transition for NAND? I think the ideal was 50% exiting this calendar year.
Steven R. Appleton: Yes, that’s still progressing well. We are very happy with the yield at the Utah fab. Those are approaching maturity on some of the wafers and we have begun the transition now in Virginia and have a good yield in that fab as well.
Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank Securities: Do you think once your 34 nanometers ramp that you will have kind of industry-leading costs and [Hinam]?
Steven R. Appleton: Yes, we believe so.
Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank Securities: Within your memory mix, how is your server memory business? Was that as expected? Any kinds of trends in that business that were strange?
Steven R. Appleton: Clearly that remains a very strong part of our business today. A lot of the down turn in demand and pricing pressure, we’ve seen it more on the consumer side, but the server business remains pretty strong.

Operator:  Welcome everyone to Micron Technology’s third quarter 2008 financial release conference call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host Kipp Bedard. 
Kipp A. Bedard: I’d like to welcome everyone to Micron Technology’s third quarter 2008 financial release conference call. On the call today is Steve Appleton, Chairman and CEO, Mark Durcan, President and Chief Operating Officer and Ron Foster, Chief Financial Officer and Vice President of Finance and Mike Sadler, Vice President of Worldwide Sales. Today’s conference call including audio and slides is also available on Micron’s website at www.Micron.com. If you have not had an opportunity to review the third quarter 2008 financial press release, it is also available on our website again at www.Micron.com.  Our call will be approximately 60 minutes in length. There will be an audio replay of this call, you may reach that by dialing 706-645-9291, with the confirmation code is 50696269. This replay will run through Thursday July 3, 2008 at 5:30 pm Mountain time. A webcast replay will be available on the company’s website until June 26, 20098. We encourage you to monitor our website at www.Micron.com throughout the quarter for the most current information including information on the various conferences that we will be attending.

We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of the presentation to conform these statements to actual results. I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Ron Foster.
Ronald C. Foster: For those listeners who haven't seen our press release which is available on our web site and includes a reconciliation of the non-GAAP numbers discussed on this call, I will review the summary of financial results for the third quarter which ended May 29. For the third quarter, revenue increased 10% and gross margins moved into positive territory as megabit sales and cost reductions outpaced the ASP declines. DRAM and NAND ASPs declined approximately 5% and 20% on a sequential quarter basis.  Megabit sales volume increased approximately 10% and 40% per DRAM and NAND flash memory products respectively from second to third quarter. The company continued to make progress in driving down production costs as costs of goods sold per megabit declined about 15% and 25% for DRAM and NAND respectively over the same period. Weight per output yield increases and node transitions all contributed to the margin improvement. The company recorded a net loss of $236 million or $0.36 per diluted share for the quarter compared to a non-GAAP loss of $314 million or $0.41 in the prior quarter. The GAAP reported loss for the second quarter included a goodwill impairment charge of $463 million.  We are pleased with our progress in reducing the operating cost structure as we continue to focus on driving down SG&A and R&D expenses. R&D expenses improved in the third quarter due to cost management efforts and progress moving key development products into production. We expect to maintain the lower run rate of operating expenses with SG&A and R&D expenses estimated to be flat to slightly down from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow was $217 million for the third quarter and $775 million for fiscal year to date. We ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. During the third quarter TECH semiconductor entered into a $600 million credit facility to refinance $240 million of outstanding debt and to finance future capital expenditures. Capital expenditures totaled $577 million in the third quarter. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2008 will be at the upper end of our previously projected range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion as we continue our investments in NAND and IMF and DRAM at MTV and TECH. Partners will provide net capital contributions of about $230 million to fund our 2008 expenditures. In fiscal 2009 capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion to $2 billion are anticipated. We expect about $300 million of this amount in net capital contributions from partners. These capital expenditures do not reflect the previously communicated $550 million capital contribution for Maya which has committed over the 2009 calendar year. Depreciation and amortization expense was $513 million in fiscal Q3 and will total approximately $2 billion for the year. In fiscal 2009 depreciation and amortization expense of about $2.25 billion is expected. I'll close there and turn the commentary over to Mike.
Michael W. Sadler: In 2007 and early 2008 we experienced a supply driven semiconductor memory pricing downturn in the face of a relatively strong demand environment. From our perspective, exiting fiscal Q3 of this year we are seeing an improved supply-demand balance. This has generally resulted in relative memory price stabilization with an encouraging upward pricing trend across the commodity DRAM product portfolio in particular. The computing industry continues to be the largest revenue driver for Micron's memory products and we are seeing demand in line with normal seasonal expectations. Although we don't have perfect visibility on the specific demand drivers within the computing space, I would characterize memory content for system growth as being particularly strong relative to absolute PC unit growth. We are starting to see some traction for DDR3 memory in select platforms and would expect penetration as we move through 2008 and into next year. We're well positioned in this face with our industry leading DDR2 and DDR3 chip sizes on 78 nanometer 300 millimeter wafers. We've begun a transition to 68 nanometer in our Singapore facility with initial production shipments and revenue generation occurring in the current quarter ultimately contributing to aggressive cost of goods sold productions. All in all we are pleased with our position in the computing space and given the recent trends encouraged about prospects for the second half of the calendar year. Our specialty DRAM product portfolio continues to enable solid performance for the company in a variety of non-computing segments such as networking, mobile handsets, and automotive. We're utilizing installed 200 millimeter capacity to manufacture both image sensors and the vast majority of our specialty DRAM products. We are selective moving high volume and high growth specialty DRAM products into 3 millimeter facilities to achieve further cost reductions and create headroom for supply growth. From a market segment viewpoint we did see particularly strong unit shipment and revenue growth in both our image sensors and low-power DRAM products for the mobile handset market in the third quarter. This speaks both to the health of the market as well as to the strength of Micron's product portfolio for this particular market segment. The NAND market still dominated by consumer applications with a strong seasonal component of demand continues to be challenged by excess supply. Our technology and scale advancements now moving to an industry leading 34 nanometer process are having a positive effect on cost of goods sold reductions but the oversupplied market environment has continued to drive prices down further. We are working diligently on strengthening the NAND product portfolio much as we have already demonstrated in the DRAM space to improve our selling prices and relative profitability independent of the market environment. To this end we are ramping up our NAND based multi-chip package efforts for the mobile [MOAL] phone arena. We have a micro-SD compatible 1 gigabyte chip in the market today and have recently begun shipments of the micro-SD cards with Micron manufactured silica. We have initial single-level cell solid state drives in the evaluation stage with various customers in the enterprise space and will introduce lower cost MLC based solid state drives for the client markets later this year. We are achieving higher average selling prices in margins via leveraging the Lexar brand and retail channel presence and are continuing down the path of moving more of our NAND output through the Lexar operations. We're proud of our operational performance and the recent trends on key metrics such as cost of goods sold reduction and bit market share growth particularly relative to other players in our competitive states. Looking to the second half of the calendar year we are enthusiastic about an improving market environment. I'll turn it over to Mark.
D. Mark Durcan: Micron had a strong quarter operationally. Our bit cost reductions ran substantially ahead of projections led by solid yields and cost cutting in the operations. The ongoing transition of Micron's NAND and core DRAM products to leading edge capacity continue to pace with 90% of that silica now being built on 300 millimeter wafers. Technology transitions also progressed as well. Tech Semiconductor continued its ramp of the industry's leading die size 1 gigabit product on our 68 nanometer technology while making substantial progress on its conversion to 300 millimeter. During the quarter they completed the fabrication of their last 200 millimeter wafers and expect to complete the transition during the second half of the year. We're well positioned with optimized products for the DDR3 transition coming. Recently Micron and Intel announced sample availability of our industry leading 34 nanometer 32 gigabit product. That product and process node is now being deployed in our IMFT joint venture and will ramp throughout the second half of the calendar year. We believe this positions us well for continued NAND cost reductions moving into the calendar 2009. Recently we closed on the creation of our DRAM joint venture Maya. The relationship with Nanya brings many advantages to Micron including joint technology development and licensing of technology as well as the capital efficient capacity associated with the joint venture. Maya will start up its initial manufacturing facility beginning early in the calendar 2009 and ramp throughout the year to an initial target of 10,000 wafers per week. We anticipate this to be a cost-effective way for Micron to add wafers and support a growing customer demand. Licensing revenue and cost benefits will grow throughout time as Maya grows capacity, Nanya adds or transitions wholly-owned capacity, and as the scope of our R&D cooperation grows. Looking to the current quarter we expect bit production growth as mid to high single digits for DRAMS and mid-teens for NANDs. Cost for bit production should mimic that and be in the mid-single digits for DRAM and mid-teens for NAND. I'll turn it back over to Kipp.
Kipp A. Bedard: We'd like to begin the questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Tim Luke of Lehman Brothers.
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers: Kipp, could you just clarify how you would perceive bit growth in both DRAM and NAND and if you were to see stable pricing from here how you would expect the [AFP] direction to turn through the coming quarter?
Michael W. Sadler: I'll speak to the AFP topic and I'll let Kipp address the bit growth question. Rather than answer the question directly I'll just tell you that quarter to date we're three and a half weeks into the current quarter, our DRAM AFPs on shipments are tracking right about flat with respect to what we achieved in fiscal Q3 and our NAND flash average selling price to date in the quarter is about 20% below what we saw in fiscal Q3.
Kipp A. Bedard: And on the production side, Tim, we're looking at NAND being in the mid-teens sequentially Q4 fiscal over Q3 fiscal and DRAM to be up mid to high single digits.
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers: Could you also comment, Kipp, just on your expectations with respect to cost reduction with respect to the two core businesses?
Kipp A. Bedard: Yes, sure. As Mark mentioned they'll be similar respectively in each one of those as the bit growth is so mid-teens on NAND and mid to high single digits on DRAM.
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers: Could you perhaps, also a more strategic question, just update us on your perception of the Intel JV and how you might view that degree of commitment around that and what other options there might be for you should Intel decide to pursue other options with respect to that venture?
Steven R. Appleton: There's a lot you had in that question. First of all, our perspective is the joint venture's running well. I haven't had any dialogue with Intel executives that they feel any differently. So a lot of I think what is out there in the market, whether it's speculation or somebody else is making comments other than what we're involved with, I can't really comment on because we continue to move forward with the joint venture as we always have. I will just point out that as we announced originally to the joint venture with Intel, it's a 10-year agreement and so we're still in the first couple of years of that.
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers: If I may, Steve, just as a follow up, could you give a comment on industry consolidation and opportunities for Micron therein?
Steven R. Appleton: With respect to which -
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers: With respect to obviously [inaudible] in Tessera and other possible opportunities?
Steven R. Appleton: Yes, I see. Well you know I've been commenting on this for I don't know 20 years now or so and always what I thought would happen doesn't happen and what I don't think will happen sometimes happens. So we have said many times that as opportunities present themselves we'll consider them and today is no different than it was a year ago or five years ago or 10 years ago. But it obviously requires more than just Micron and to the extent that there are opportunities when there are other willing partners, whether it be joint ventures like we just did with Nanya or something else in a different form, we're certainly willing to consider it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan.
Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: Can you talk about how you expect your operating expenses to evolve for the rest of this year?
Ronald C. Foster: As I commented, the SG&A and R&D costs have come down in Q3. We're on a good trend line on the absolute basis and we expect as we go into the fourth quarter that they will be flat to slightly down both in SG&A and R&D in the fourth quarter as well.
Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: And then on your wafer production, what did it grow sequentially in Q3 and what do you expect it to grow in Q4?
D. Mark Durcan: Shawn, we were up a couple percent in Q3 and we're expecting another couple percent in Q4.
Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: Okay. And then finally, in terms of channel inventories can you talk to us a little bit about what you're seeing out there in any quantitative way you can for both your, well, all of your DRAM and NAND and sensor markets?
D. Mark Durcan: Sure, I'd be happy to. On the DRAM side my view of things is very little inventory on our shelves. As a matter of fact we're bumping up against the minimum that we think we can carry and still do an accurate job of servicing our customers, so the demand [miron] is quite strong on the DRAM side. In the, With respect to the inventory levels that our customers have, as I've said many times there's very little incentive for our customers to carry inventory unless they want to do some price hedging and those questions would probably be better addressed to our customers. But just based on my view of things, I wouldn't imagine there's much inventory in the hands of our customers. In terms of the channel, the minimal value adders and the traders and so forth, my view is that the market's being fairly thinly traded right now and there's probably little inventory in place at least in the DRAM arena with respect to the speculators. The NAND side is a little bit different. I do believe that the spot market traders, if you will, will have probably accumulated a fair amount of inventory. My view of things is there's probably a fair amount of inventory in the spot market with respect to NAND flash. We're pretty flush with respect to our own inventories. We've got one to two weeks worth of finished goods in the NAND area and I don't believe our customers are carrying much inventory either.  In terms of image sensors, we're a little heavier on finished goods inventory. We've got about, if I remember correctly, somewhere between six and seven weeks of finished goods inventory on image sensors. That's relatively flat with where we exited the prior quarter. We are expecting a pretty strong seasonal demand uptake as we move through the second half of the calendar year. I don't believe our customers are sitting on any inventory with respect to image sensors.  So that's kind of my color on the inventory situation.
Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: Okay. And then finally, and I'm sorry if you said this already, I had to leave for a fire alarm, what do you expect pricing to do if it stays flat for NAND and DRAM in your fiscal Q4?
Ronald C. Foster: I answered the question already. Just real briefly -
Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: Yes, sorry.
Ronald C. Foster: You can probably pick it up on the transcript.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Berenbaum - Cowen and Company.
Daniel Berenbaum - Cowen and Company: Can you talk about what percentage of your mix was DRAM and NAND in the quarter? And also it seems from the numbers that DRAM was profitable. Can you comment on that? And then also can you talk a little bit about your NAND bit growth guidance. It sounds like you guided for kind of mid-teen percent bit growth. I thought the comment on your Q1 call was to think about 30% to 40% sequential bit growth over the next few quarters, so I'm wondering if something has changed there other than the Singapore push-out?
Ronald C. Foster: Sure. Let me start with a revenue breakdown for you, Daniel. We had core DRAM in the high 20% range, specialty DRAM in the low 20% range, imaging as we noted on the press release was around 11%, and we had NAND in the mid- to high 30% range. And on the profitability we did note last quarter that we felt we were probably one of two if not the only DRAM manufacturer to keep positive gross margins and of course with the data we provided about our cost reductions relative to our AFPs we certainly improved on that. And I might let Mark talk more to maybe the NAND bit growth.
D. Mark Durcan: Dan, on the NAND bit growth, it's going to be in the mid- to high teens on a quarter-over-quarter basis going forward but it will be a little lumpy. We may exceed that in certain quarters. As you'll recall a couple of, a quarter ago I think we outran our estimates substantially pulling some bits forward. That actually happened a little bit this quarter as well, so I think the sort of running mid- to high teens numbers is a good one to think about but think about it exceeding that on a quarter-over-quarter basis depending on exactly where we're at related to the technology transitions.
Daniel Berenbaum - Cowen and Company: So, mid- to high teens, not 30%? Did I just misunderstand that from previous quarters as a good run rate going forward?
Ronald C. Foster: Well, you've got both references correct. In the past we've used the term averaging around 30% over the next several quarters and as Mark's pointing out, sometimes we'll get that pulled in as the manufacturing folks execute better and that makes the next quarters comp a little bit more difficult. But we'll still have a pretty tall year-over-year bit growth as we go into 09.
Daniel Berenbaum - Cowen and Company: And then can you just help me understand how much of your NAND production goes to Lexar Products now?
Richard C. Foster: Yes, about 20% for the quarter.
Daniel Berenbaum - Cowen and Company: That's 20% of, in that 50% goes to Intel and then another 20% to Lexar and 30% elsewhere?
Richard C. Foster: That's correct.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Pitzer - Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: A couple of questions here first, when you look at your FY09 cap ex budget of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, what kind of market assumptions are you making around that number and what kind of growth can you see in both the DRAM and NAND output relative to that cap ex number?
D. Mark Durcan: Well first of all, the cap ex number, I mean the reason we have these ranges is because we constantly look at this quarterly and it could go up or it could go down. I think what we look at in the long-term basis on our cap ex number frankly isn't so much based on what we think the market's going to do next year because obviously we'll adjust to that if we need to, it's really around either planned expansion or planned technology conversions that we have that are obviously in need to be executed upon in terms of planning much before we ever get there. So that's why we have the ranges that we do.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Is there a larger portion going to DRAM or to NAND, or how does that break out?
D. Mark Durcan: Well it, again it's a little hard right off the top of my head to break that out, because remember we essentially have two projects in 09 in addition to what we would be doing on a normal basis among the wafer fabs, there's the IMFT and there's Maya and those will both be in 09, at least calendar 09, and so the timing of those are obviously independent of each other and it's just a little hard for us to know exactly when one hits versus the other.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: And then, guys, on the NAND side can you talk a little bit about the solid state drive market especially going into enterprise and I guess help me understand at what point will solid state drives be a big enough percentage of your NAND business and start kind of breaking it out and at least telling us 10% to 15% or 15% to 20% range?
D. Mark Durcan: Well it's critical to us from a strategic standpoint certainly and we've got product both in the enterprise space as you noted as well as from the client space primarily the notebook computer market. There's no, as a matter of fact there's no revenue generation whatsoever today for us from either of those markets. In terms of it being meaningful, that's a little bit subjective but we're probably looking at well into next year before we feel like it's meaningful in terms of a revenue standpoint. I don't know that we're ever at a point where we're going to break it out publicly but we're looking at it being meaningful for us sometime in the 2009 timeframe.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: And then, guys, just my last question. DDR3, what percent of the calendar second half capacity on DRAM do you think will be dedicated to DDR3 and if you could help me understand the die-size penalty that might exist as you migrate to DDR3, that'd be helpful?
D. Mark Durcan: Sure. In terms of our output in the second half of the calendar year, we've got, by the way, plenty of flexibility to dial it up or down because it utilizes essentially the same tool set in the fab, but we're currently targeting high single digits of our DRAM output as being DDR3 in the second half of the year. And the penalty that we pay on the same density DDR3 chip versus DDR2 at 78 nanometers is about 3% or 4%, something like that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Derrick Tarzars - Citigroup.
Derrick Tarzars - Citigroup: Earlier you were asked about potential consolidation specifically around Qimonda and Tessera. I realize that you get this question quite often and you've looked at it before. I guess if you could lay out for us some of the pros and cons as far as taking on Qimonda and then maybe separately just taking on Qimonda taking on Tessera instead?
D. Mark Durcan: You know, it's almost impossible for us to do that because we frankly don't have any kind of inside knowledge on what exists at Qimonda, in Tessera, etc., so we'll just have to look at that opportunity if it were to surface. But I couldn't lay anything out for you because I don't know what it would look like at the moment.
Derrick Tarzars - Citigroup: And then you talked about specialty memory. It sounded like demand for image sensors and demand for lower power DRAM was pretty healthy. Could you give us any sense of what kind of participation you have in embedded NAND? I guess there've been some, I mean obviously there've been some new smart phones launching fairly high density, with a fairly large amount of NAND in them. If you could just talk about how those are impacting overall market demand?
D. Mark Durcan: Yes. They're very important to us strategically particularly because we are one of just a couple of semiconductor makers that has the ability to package its own silicon in a NAND and lower-powered DRAM multi-chip package. We've got quite a bit of activity with virtually every handset maker underway today in terms of designing and qualifying our products. In terms of revenue contribution today, the NAND based [MTD] which I believe you had referred to as embedded NAND are insignificant in terms of revenue generation.
Derrick Tarzars - Citigroup: And then lastly, can you give me a sense of, as you look at second half capacity for DRAM, what kind of assumptions are you taking for the market as far as what Samsung's capacity build would be going into calendar 3Q and 4Q?
D. Mark Durcan: Probably the best we can do is quote those industry experts that are out there, and largely what we've read is that Q2 marks the high-water mark for sequential bit growth in the DRAM industry for calendar 08. You would be looking at calendar Q3 and Q4 to be lower than what we just saw in calendar Q2. And in general, most of those "experts" are ranging somewhere between 55% and 60% total bit growth production year-over-year for the industry.
Derrick Tarzars - Citigroup: And you don't have any thoughts one way or another on what Samsung or any of your discussions with equipment manufacturers, what you think Samsung might be doing in the back half?
D. Mark Durcan: No. And the obvious answer is it's probably best to just ask them.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets.
Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets: First of all, in the 34 nanometer production of NAND, what percentage of your production in the second half of the year will be 34 nanometer and kind of what's the outlook there for the first half of next year?
D. Mark Durcan: We'll have to dial that as the ramp progresses and see how we're doing, but on a wafer basis we expect to be 50% transitioned end of the year, something like that.
Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets: 50%? And then the second question, related to the Nanya opportunity and what you've discussed so far, when should we start being kind of kicking on the royalty or payment front that would really start impacting your model? I mean, is it second half of calendar year 09? Is it before that?
D. Mark Durcan: I think that in two different terms you would see some of the up front payments upon close I believe it is and then royalties obviously would be associated with the ramp of either the Nanya converted capacity and/or the joint venture.
Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets: And in terms of time line?
D. Mark Durcan: I believe Nanya had quoted first half 09 for their conversion, their captive capacity, and second half 09 calendar for the joint venture.
Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets: And then third question related to the image sensor, can you give us kind of an update where we potentially stand in I guess the separation of the business and also follow up of the question to that is, your margins obviously increased nicely there this quarter, can you comment I guess a bit about the mix there and what were the factors?
D. Mark Durcan: Yes. First of all, we, you know for that business as you noted it did improve and that is I think largely reflective of the image business migrating more toward the higher-end pixel density and obviously was through May and I think as we move throughout this fall, the second half will probably be dominated by 3 meg. And we were well positioned in that space and currently that business bottomed really a couple of quarters ago and if you notice our results compared to some others, we've continued on a pretty good path of recovering you know where I think we had lost for a couple of other reasons out of the marketplace historically. So that's actually going pretty well. And we know what our targets are for that business and as we've noted before we're exploring with potential partners how we can achieve those targets. And I would just say that we hope to accomplish or I suppose another way of saying it is complete something sometime in this quarter in terms of separation.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh - Thinkpanmure LLC.
Vijay Rakesh - Thinkpanmure LLC: Back to the licensing question with Nanya, apart from the JV RAM when would you seeing the upfront licensing from Nanya?
D. Mark Durcan: I think we answered that before. The first licensing piece comes in conjunction with the closing or technology transfer and then the royalty stream begins as they ramp production.
Vijay Rakesh - Thinkpanmure LLC: And so when do you expect that closing?
D. Mark Durcan: We haven't put any estimated date.
Vijay Rakesh - Thinkpanmure LLC: And on the DRAM side, this last question, you said pricing so far looks flat. Any stab on where you think for the quarter it runs sort of looking at demand and the channels?
D. Mark Durcan: Well a comment on the quarter to date pricing being flat, you know there are several components of that of course and the commodity DDR2 pricing for the PC industry is actually up quite nicely. It's actually been rising every two week negotiation periods since February. As a matter of fact the commodity DDR2 contract pricing today is up about 35% relative to where it bottomed out in February. So that's moving up quite nicely. The other part of our DRAM product portfolio is our specialty DRAM product and actually that's quite significant for us, so the logical conclusion is that that pricing has come down somewhat to effect an overall basically flat pricing quarter to date.
Vijay Rakesh - Thinkpanmure LLC: And just one last question on R&D and SG&A you said are coming down slightly, any quantification that it will be down 5% as we look here toward Q4 kind of quarter-to-quarter?
D. Mark Durcan: We couldn't quite hear your question.
Vijay Rakesh - Thinkpanmure LLC: You said R&D and SG&A should be coming down slightly as you look at Q4 quarter-to-quarter, any more quantifications kind of? Will it be down 5% quarter-to-quarter on the R&D and SG&A line?
Ronald C. Foster: Any more color on that? Was that your question?
Vijay Rakesh - Thinkpanmure LLC: Yes.
Ronald C. Foster: We are continuing to do cross-management efforts across all of our SG&A and R&D areas and also have got the benefits of some of our prior actions that are continuing to flow through, so in general we see that it will be as I mentioned flat to slightly down in the fourth quarter. And we'll keep managing that in a downward trajectory as a percent of revenue also as we do our planning process going forward.
D. Mark Durcan: Vijay, probably some other color around that is we think that we've probably run out, not all but a lot of what happened on the SG&A side and obviously we continue to go through these technology transitions and make them more efficient and we think that that's probably where we have some left to continue to wring out and I think it's probably worth noting that it is in that probably at least this quarter-over-quarter somewhere in that 5% range that we would expect to see.
Vijay Rakesh - Thinkpanmure LLC: And this mid-quarter separation on the imagining business side should also have, correct?
D. Mark Durcan: I think that's a good point that you made. Right now as you might imagine because it's a slightly different business that the imaging business actually had slightly higher R&D and SG&A as a part of that business than the memory business does. So that also happens to be lifting the index if you will for our current operating expenses and as we expect to get that separate this quarter then that obviously would come out of the calculation as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from James Covello - Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: Just a couple quick questions, first on content per box, I heard what you said has been sort of going on up until now with good increase in content per box. Question kind of short term is are you concerned at all because of some of the price increases that the OEMs are feeling from other components or some of the commodity costs that are getting passed through to them that the content per box could slow a little bit? And then longer term, any concerns around the issues with 32 bit operating systems and you know only recognizing 3 gigs or so of DRAM and what work-arounds we might see for that?
D. Mark Durcan: Sure. On the pricing issue with respect to its impact on content, absolutely there's, whenever we see increasing PC component prices and in this case an increasing price on the component that we provide, certainly we get concerned about that applying margin pressure to the PC makers and potentially resulting in them slowing down content. I can only say to date, Jim, that we haven't seen that be the case and right up through the last couple of weeks as I mentioned we've seen roughly 35% price increases in the DDR2 area. We haven't seen a slowdown in content yet but it's something we need to watch very carefully because there's no question that rising prices may have some impact in terms of content per system. The second question on the memory limitation of a 32 bit operating system, is it a longer term concern? Certainly it would be a longer term concern if we weren't going to see the industry move to 64 bit operating systems. That obviously lifts the headroom or the cap tremendously above the 4 gigabyte limitation of 32 bit operating systems. But it's probably worth noting that today the average content per box is 2 gigabytes roughly and we've still got plenty of room to get to that 4 gigabyte per system limitation on 32 bit systems.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: And it seems like there's a little bit of confusion amongst the industry folks whether it's a little over 3 gigs or 4 gigs is the limitation. You're clear view is that 4 gigs is sort of the max, you know, you can go up to 4 gigs.
D. Mark Durcan: Well I think it's a mathematical calculation as opposed to speculation, so 4 gigabytes would be the limitation and we've got pretty clear sailing with 4 gigabytes I believe. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: Maybe if I could ask a final question of Ron. Ron, how are you feeling about the balance sheet and what potentially might be out there, what would be the pressure points that cause you to go out and raise some additional capital to kind of get you through the current period?
Ronald C. Foster: Yes, Jim. As I mentioned I gave the perspective on 09 cap ex and our plans and commitments going forward. We're continuing to monitor a couple of things. One is the memory market trends and pricing, and secondly obviously taking a look at business growth opportunities that we might foresee in the future and evaluation our cash position and cash requirements. We're going through our planning process now and we're obviously mapping out our cash requirements and plans as I mentioned them in terms of the cap ex structure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James.
Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James: Question on CMOS sensors, what is the market environment? Is it something you would characterize as seasonal going into this quarter?
D. Mark Durcan: Sure. I think we're starting to head into what should be a strong seasonal period. Actually the results that we delivered in fiscal Q3 were in what would typically be regarded as a slack seasonal period in terms of the demand and I think the growth in Q3 can be attributed to our strong position in high pixel density area. That would be in the 3 and 5 megapixel density area. We're probably about a month away from seeing what should be a good seasonal up pick in terms of mobile phone and PC demand and so forth. So the real strong tailwind that we expect to get from the market seasonally is still just a little bit in front of us.
Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James: And then one follow up on that subject but on DRAMs, have you seen any indication of back-to-school or are we just a little too early for that?
D. Mark Durcan: I believe that we're a little bit too early for it. My hopes are that the pricing trends that we've carried forward since February in the commodity area will get us through what I would call the slack seasonal period which extends now about another month. And if that is the case I feel really good about the strong seasonal demand kind of carrying through the rest of the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities.
Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities: Yes, the 55% to 65% bit number that you mentioned for DRAM, is that industry DRAM production this year and is that despite the cap ex cuts of 40% to 50% in memory?
Ronald C. Foster: Yes, that's correct.
Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities: And what's your best assessment of NAND flash production this year, bit production this year and demand given factors such as SSD drives and things like the new iPhone and 3D phones?
Ronald C. Foster: I'll state more, my comment's more to the supply side. Again those same industry groups that track that are looking at about 130% to about 145% bit growth and I don't know if Mike would like to put any additional color around the demand side.
Michael W. Sadler: You know, demand in the NAND flash area the car demand is really a function of market price as well particularly the density of cars. So the demand is going to be sufficient to absorb that 130% to 150% supply growth that Kipp talked about. The only question is at what price is it going to sell. So I hope that provides some clarity. Just a note by the way, I'll answer a question before it's asked with respect to DRAM demand. Our best view is in the computing space because we've got some pretty tight connections with the various computer manufacturers. And what we're looking at in terms of DRAM bit demand growth in calendar 2008 is about 65% to 70%, at least from a sampling of our customers, and in calendar Q3 relative to calendar Q2 on a sequential basis about a 25% growth.
Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities: And in NAND flash, I know that you've pushed out your Singapore fab but are you seeing other evidence of NAND flash capacity cuts? What do you see out there in terms of capacity additions or cutbacks in NAND flash?
D. Mark Durcan: Well we've seen a couple of competitor announcements but those are all public and I think you can pull those off the public web sites probably better than we can report them to you here.
Operator: Our next question comes from Analyst for John Lau - Jefferies & Co.
Analyst John Lau - Jefferies & Co.: A little bit of clarification on your 2009 cap ex budget. That $1.5 billion to $2 billion range you gave, does that include your joint venture in IMFT and Nanya, your contribution to those ventures?
Ronald C. Foster: The $1.5 billion and $2 billion is our gross cap ex expenditures we anticipate for our facilities in 2009. It does not include capital contribution that we've committed of $550 million for the Maya joint venture. That is, for the 2009 calendar year.
Analyst John Lau - Jefferies & Co.: And what about IMFD in flash?
Ronald C. Foster: Yes, that is included.
Analyst John Lau - Jefferies & Co.: And my second question was regarding your image sensors business, could you give us a percentage of your sales coming from higher end or higher mexapixel image sensors with 3 megapixel and above?
Ronald C. Foster: Could you please repeat that question?
Analyst John Lau - Jefferies & Co.: How much of your image sensor business is 3 megapixel and above?
Ronald C. Foster: We just reviewed that data before the call. It's more than 50%.
Analyst John Lau - Jefferies & Co.: And to which end markets are you selling handsets versus digital cameras?
Ronald C. Foster: The majority of the revenue's going to handsets. That's correct.
Analyst John Lau - Jefferies & Co.: So are you seeing any trend there in digital cameras, your image sensors are replacing CCDs or is that domain pretty much left to CCDs?
Ronald C. Foster: No, we have selectively won a couple of camera designs away from the CCD makers. That's the 8/9 megapixel area so I certainly would not suggest that today CMOS sensors are taking over CCDs in the DSC space, Digital Still Camera space, but we have I don't know between five and 10 active projects underway in the digital still camera area with our CMOS sensors.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank Securities.
Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank Securities: One question, do you see any impact, I know it's hard to figure out the judged decisions, but Rambus ITC action are asking for an injunction against Hynix. Would that impact your business at all? Just kind of curious, if they happen to get that injunction?
D. Mark Durcan: We haven't even considered that. We don't really have any comment on it because that's a legal proceeding between somebody else, but that hasn't gone into our thinking.
Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank Securities: And also if you look at some of the data from DRAM exchange on the NAND contract prices, it seems like the 8 gigabit MLC is taking a particular pounding. Could you talk about maybe why that may be? Is that the mainstream density now? Is that where everybody's production volumes are? Just kind of curious if you have some insight there?
Ronald C. Foster: Well it's not our, Our mainstream volume of 2 gigabyte are 16 gigabit shifts. I have not seen a significant difference in the market prices for a 1 gigabyte versus a 2 gigabyte chip. Certainly the sweet spot in the market today in terms of volume is MLC either 1 gigabyte or 2 gigabyte chip and yes, as I mentioned in my comments at the beginning of the call, the market today is clearly oversupplied and there is price pressure certainly across the sweet spot products and that would include the 8 gigabit chip you referenced.
Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank Securities: And the final question, can you give us an update on Lehi and where you are in that ramp, whether it's the wafer starts, as a percentage of the peak capacity, whatever way you'd like to put it?
D. Mark Durcan: Sure. We hit our initial peak capacity about six months ago when we were in the process of adding roughly 15% additional and that will play out through the second calendar half of the year.
Michael W. Sadler: From a technology perspective the vast majority is on 50 nanometer today but we're into the 34 nanometer transition now.
Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank Securities: And with the 15% additional capacity, what's the capacity of Lehi on wafer starts basically?
D. Mark Durcan: It'll be roughly 60,000 a month.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel Partners.
Kevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel Partners: It looks like on the specialty DRAM you had pricing coming down tremendously. Can you talk more about that?
Ronald C. Foster: I wouldn't say pricing came down tremendously by any means. We had virtually all of our bit growth in the quarter came from the commodity DRAM area. So think of our specialty DRAM product portfolio as being, I don't have the specifics at my fingertips, but relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. Virtually all of the bit growth came from the commodity DRAM area and just as a reference point, the average selling price per bit in the commodity DRAM area, think of it as being in the $3.00 to $4.00 range and the average selling price per bit in the specialty DRAM area, think of it being in the $10.00 to $12.00 range. So the net effect of the growth in the commodity DRAM area, even though we're in a very strengthening pricing environment, was that 5% quarter-over-quarter DRAM AFP decline. I hope I explained that clearly.
Kevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel Partners: How about going forward? Do you see the pricing still flat going into the next quarter?
D. Mark Durcan: Well as I mentioned, if you weren't on at the beginning of the call, I mentioned that our average DRAM pricing through the first three and a half weeks of fiscal Q4 is relatively flat, is flat relative to what we actually achieved in fiscal Q3. So as mix may change going through the balance of the quarter, who knows what impact that will have. But with no speculation whatsoever, just actual results, the first three and a half weeks of the quarter, DRAM pricing is flat. I think you did ask where we may be seeing pricing pressure in the specialty DRAM area and in particular the low density synchronous DRAM area for a variety of consumer applications, hard disk drives, and so forth, we are seeing I'll say more severe price pressure in that area than we are in any other portion of the specialty DRAM product portfolio.
Operator: Our next question comes from [Edis Mellick].
[Edis Mellick]: On NAND, if you look at the last two years, June is a typical month that you start seeing some seasonal strength and here June has been quite weak. Is there a scenario where NAND could be in oversupply for the rest of the year? Is that a scenario that you guys have or are modeling or drafting your business conditions?
D. Mark Durcan: Of course we're modeling all different kinds of scenarios in our business conditions but we can't speculate on what the relative balance is going to be through the rest of the year. I think it’s -we're confident that demand is going to be stronger in the second half of the calendar year than it was in the first half of the year due to the consumer nature of the products that consume NAND flash. Whether it's going to be strong enough to absorb the supply, that's your job as well as our job to try and sense that. But we're not going to make a prediction.
[Edis Mellick]: And in your fiscal year 09 cap ex, any comments on the loading of that cap ex or this still too early?
Ronald C. Foster: We haven't specifically broken it out by quarter. I've just given a view and we'll work through it during the year.
[Edis Mellick]: And one last question, some of your peers are struggling with their yields. We keep on hearing what defect they’re having on both the NAND and DRAM side. Is your sense, I mean, what is the probability of you know some of your peers hitting defect challenges and migration issues in the second half 08? Is the probability higher as you move to 5x nanometer and DRAM and 4x below nanometer NAND?
D. Mark Durcan: It's hard to say exactly what our competitors are experiencing. I would say generally that yes, the technology's not getting any easier. For Micron, however, I've got to tell you we're pretty comfortable with our technology from a defect and yield ability standpoint. We're particularly pleased with where our 34 nanometer's coming out and we think that we've done some things in a different way there that are going to give us potentially significant advantages in the DRAM.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Wade.
Bill Wade: A quick macro question for you, any commentary in general would be appreciated. You talk about the geographic breakout of revenue and whether you see the trends from the last couple of quarters and the last year or two continuing through the end of this year and then everything on out.
D. Mark Durcan: We had a tough time hearing your question, but I think I got it. Basically we split our geographic revenues out a couple different ways. 75% is outside of the US and 50% is in the outside of the US in Europe. Is that about right, Mike?
Michael W. Sadler: Yes.
Bill Wade: Can you talk about going forward where you see the trend sort of continuing and how that's, in talking to your customers, what they're seeing as well and the degree to which they communicated that to you?
D. Mark Durcan: Well revenue generation, wherever you recognize revenue can be somewhat misleading. Certainly the trend is that more and more of our shipments are going into what we call Greater China, which is Taiwan, Hong Kong and China itself, that has been the trend in not only at Micron but it's been the trend in the industry for at least the last 10 years, and I would certainly expect that trend is going to continue.
Bill Wade: Can you put any, quantify that? Put any numbers on it with regard to you all specifically?
D. Mark Duncan: No, I cannot.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Vassily - Pacific Crest Securities.
Kevin Vassily - Pacific Crest Securities: I want to go back to the demand dynamics in specialty versus commodity DRAM. Would flat bit growth or no bit growth in what's essentially calendar Q2 and your fiscal Q3 be a normal trend for you guys? And as you look out into your fiscal Q4, do you see a resumption of growth in what's obviously a more profitable part of your business?
D. Mark Durcan: A flat quarter for us in the specialty DRAM area would not be normal, although it wouldn't be what, we're not particularly concerned. It's not alarming, let's put it that way. We expect our specialty DRAM business to continue to grow. We do expect the components of that are going to be slightly different. We believe that our business in the mobile handset area, our DRAM business in the mobile handset area, is going to grow rapidly. We believe our market share in that area is relatively low so there's plenty of room for us to take additional market share and exhibit some pretty strong growth in that area. And that business in particular does have a seasonal component, the demand in that business does have a seasonal component to it.
Kevin Vassily - Pacific Crest Securities: Were you at all constrained in terms of some of your trailing edge lines in terms of being able to kind of grow that business? I think I heard you mention that you were transitioning some of that product over to 300 millimeter.
D. Mark Durcan: Yes, we were. I'm glad you asked the question. We, as I mentioned in the comments I made earlier, most of the specialty DRAM portfolio is manufactured on 200 millimeter wafers and as you know we're not growing 200 millimeter capacity. In quarter three I can't quantify it but certainly that 200 millimeter capacity envelope limited our unit and revenue shipments in the specialty DRAM area in Q3. We have selectively identified a few of what we believe are going to be high growth specialty DRAM products and we're porting them over to an advanced process technology as well as from 200 millimeter to 200 millimeter diameter wafers so we can grow the business faster.
Kevin Vassily - Pacific Crest Securities: Just one last question on this, you don't think that part of what might have happened here in Q3 had anything to do with a slowdown in the end markets for your specialty DRAM, particularly in the handset business which sounds like you're targeting as a growth opportunity?
D. Mark Durcan: No. In the handset piece in particular we achieved growth. We'll leave it at that.
Ronald C. Foster: Before we take our last question, I'd like to just clarify one small point earlier. We had a question come in about when we expected to close the Nanya deal and as I recall now Mark actually mentioned it in his opening statements. We actually closed it during the last fiscal quarter and recognized a small licensing fee already. So I just wanted to clarify that. And with that, we'd like to take the last question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Morris - Oppenheimer & Co.
Daniel Morris - Oppenheimer & Co.: Just looking at your cost declines, you did another good quarter there, you mentioned three factors: wafer output, low transition and yield improvements. Is there any way you could quantify how much of the cost declines are coming from those segments?
Ronald C. Foster: We don't normally break that out, so if you'd like to try a second last question, we'd be happy to entertain that.
Daniel Morris - Oppenheimer & Co.: When you look at the 68 nanometer, you mentioned that you're ramping there on DRAM. Could you talk about how much that might be as a percentage by the end of the year?
D. Mark Duncan: On 68 nanometer?
Daniel Morris - Oppenheimer & Co.: Yes.
D. Mark Duncan: Well it's really running in the Tech facility only today so by the end of the year on a wafer start basis, we would certainly expect that to be north of 50%, probably closer to 75% of the total output there. With that we'd like to thank everyone for participating on the call today. If you will please bear with me, I need to repeat the Safe Harbor protection language.

Operator:  Good afternoon. My name is Mary and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Micron Technology’s second quarter 2008 financial release conference call. (Operator instructions). Thank you it is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Kipp Bedard, sir you may begin your conference.
Kipp Bedard: Thank you very much, I would like to also add my welcome to Micron Technology’s second quarter 2008 financial release conference call. On the call today is Steve Appleton, Chairman and CEO, Mark Durcan, President and Chief Operating Officer and Mike Sadler, Vice President of Worldwide Sales. This conference call, including audio and slides, is also available on Micron's website at micron.com.

We are under no duty to update any of the forward looking statements after the date of the presentation to conform these statements to actual results. I’ll now turn the call over to Mr. Mike Sadler.
Mike Sadler: Thanks Kipp. We continue to feel the effects of an oversupplied market in fiscal Q2 and saw average selling price declines for both our DRAM and NAN flash memory product lines. While we had another quarter of strong operational execution and associated costs of goods sold reductions, the unfavorable pricing environment overwhelmed operational efficiencies, resulting in the operating loss we are reporting today. As I mentioned in last quarter’s call and in the mid quarter analyst conference, we have seen strong demand throughout this supply driven cyclical downturn, which has now spanned about one year. This continues to be the case as the computing and mobile phone markets in particular are exhibiting both solid unit and content growth. We have an industry leading technology position with our six step squared 78 nanometer DRAM process and circuit designs which are fully ramped on 300 millimeter wafers in our Virginia facility. We are in the early stages of ramping the 68 nanometer process at the 300 millimeter facility in Singapore. This puts more distance between Micron and the competition in terms of manufacturing efficiency with an effective 20% chip size reduction verses the 78 nanometer process. We now have our 1 gigabit DDR 3 product in volume production and are firming up second half 08 supply programs with some key early adopting OEMs who value the performance and power savings associated with the DDR 3 technology. Motivated by a combination of operating system and application enhancements as well as price elasticity, our computing customers are packing more and more memory into their systems. This marries up well to our strategy and capability of running high density 1 gigabit and 2 gigabit chips as our primary volume drivers on the advanced process technology nodes. On the other end of the spectrum, from a cash flow, operating income, market opportunity and customer satisfaction perspective, we are making good use of our remaining 200 millimeter DRAM capacity. Moving forward, we do not see this changing for the foreseeable future with our diverse family of specialty DRAM products showing sustainably strong demand from a variety of market segments, including networking, telecom and a variety of consumer electronics product markets. On the NAND flash front we are in the middle of a seasonal lull for consumer electronics products, one of the primary demand drivers for flash memory. This in conjunction with unprecedented industry supply growth has resulted in the challenging pricing environment I referenced earlier. We should see seasonally stronger demand in the second half of the year and over the long haul we believe with conviction that this is a high growth market leveraging Micron’s core technological capabilities. We are continuing with the rapid cadence of NAND process technology development and implementation. Just two quarters after the introduction of our 50 nanometer technology node, we have started our sub 40 nanometer production ramp and this will proceed throughout the balance of this year. At this technology node, we have accomplished our objective of being on par or better than the competition with respect to both die size and operational efficiency.  Economies of scale and rounding out the product portfolio are the remaining hurdles and we are well on the way to closing the gap on both of those. We will make initial production shipments of our first micro SD card compatible product, an 8 gigabit chip on a 50 nanometer technology in the current quarter. This product is being made available to our traditional OEM customers for bundling in products such as mobile phones and digital cameras as well as to retail channel customers through our Lexar brand. We are rolling out a broad family of NAND plus DRAM multi-chip packaged products for the mobile handset market and have stacked up a number of design wins that will result in revenue contribution this fiscal year. Finally, we have introduced our initial line of solid state drives, 32 and 64 gigabit drives with SLC NAND as a market entry and will roll out a low cost MLC drive and very high performance SLC follow on products later this year. We are demonstrating success with our CMOS image sensors in the high pixel density segment of the market at 2 megapixels plus as a result of the superior image quality associated with our pixel and image processing technology. Customers have embraced and continue to embrace our sensors for use in high end products such as 3G mobile phones and digital cameras. In fiscal Q2, we bolstered the product portfolio with the introduction of a 9 megapixel sensor for the digital camera market and demonstration of our initial wafer level module, essentially a stand along camera for the value end of the mobile phone camera market. To sum it we are both proud and pleased with our existing technology and product portfolio today and with the trajectory for advancing both as we move forward. With just a little cooperation from the markets on supply demand balancing, we are well positioned to deliver positive results. We appreciate your continued interest and I’ll turn it over to Steve.
Steve Appleton:  Thanks Mike. I said at the last earnings call that I intended not to be the interim CFO at this earnings call and I’m happy to announce that that’s true. I didn’t beat it by much but I just want to introduce Ron Foster who is with us here today. And we had already put out a press release announcing his joining Micron. We’re excited to have him. I didn’t really put him in a position to answer questions today since he really only joined the last couple days but we’re very excited to have him join the team. I just want to make a couple of comments around the financials and then we’ll move on to the Q&A. I don’t intend to go through the finances in any detail, you can obviously look at the release and ask questions about it as we move through the conference call. First I do want to highlight that you know we had some significant cost reductions, we had indicated that we thought we would be able to achieve those at the last call. In fact we did, we had about a 15% reduction quarter over quarter on the DRAM. And we also had about a 25% reduction quarter over quarter on the NAND. So we feel like the execution on the operation was pretty good and in fact our operating cash flow actually increased slightly over the last quarter to about $282 million. Now on the R&D I think it’s also worth pointing out it was up from the guidance that we had given a little bit. And that was entirely due to really just the timing of the product qualifications, it wasn’t due to anything else and that affects when a device moves from R&D into cost of goods sold and the difference was entirely due to that. I also want to note that our overall DRAM gross margin actually remained positive as well for the quarter. So I think those are some good data points to have and with that we’ll open it up for questions.
Kipp Bedard:  Thanks Steve, with that we’d like to now take questions from callers. (Instructions).
Operator:  Certainly sir. (Operator instructions). And our first question comes from Daniel Amir from Lazard Capital, please go ahead sir.
Daniel Amir – Lazard Capital Markets: Thanks a lot and thank you for taking my call. A couple questions here. I guess on the NAND and DRAM markets, obviously it’s been a struggle here in terms of memory pricing this past quarter. What’s kind of, what do you see now in the market in terms of both DRAM and NAND, in terms of demand supply balance and how do you kind of manage your business here going forward in terms of the cost reductions to accommodate that potential change here?
Mike Sadler:  Yeah, this is Mike, I’ll address the market piece and then Steve will address the cost reduction piece. On the DRAM side, you know my assessment is that the market is relatively balanced right now and that is kind of evidenced by the flat pricing environment essentially for the last couple of months. I think we were successful in passing on a price increase to our OEM customers either late January or early February and price have essentially been flat since then. And that continues to be kind of steady state.  So generally speaking a balance supply demand environment on the commodity DRAM. Certain pockets of the specialty DRAM product portfolio are in tight supply and we’re struggling to meet demand in certain pockets. But generally speaking on the commodity side, balanced supply and demand. My view of things on the NAND flash side is not quite as positive from our perspective. We’re still seeing a continual oversupply in the NAND flash market. I think much of that can be attributed to the seasonal lull that I mentioned earlier. But certainly my view of things is that supply exceeds demand today and there continues to be price pressure.
Steve Appleton:  Thanks Mike, on really the reaction that we have of course of the pricing pressure in the marketplace and let me just point out that we had as we noted in the press release we had a 15% decrease in the average selling price of DRAM and we were able to reduce our costs in DRAM about that amount. So you know clearly we would like the pricing environment to be better but I think we have been executing pretty well and those matched up.  Now on the NAND of course we had a 30% decrease and that’s a pretty touch number to outrun in a given quarter. But let me just say that we do think that the advances we’re making in the technology will help. Obviously we continue to gain scale as we ramp our facilities both in advanced process node and in more wafers and we’re doing a lot of work around the op ex and materials. So we think we have runway in front of us. But let me just also say that you know we’ve had some pretty big decreases sustained now for this downturn hat Mike talked about really over the last year.  And you know it just doesn’t appear that at least on average for these products it would be sustainable and I think that you’re starting to see a number of companies struggle with the environment we’re in which really and you can see the announcements just like we do. I think a lot of these companies have gone into balance sheet preservation and they’re trying to figure out how to continue one where we think actually we’re pretty good. I mean you look at our cash balances, we’re still about $1.9 billion and you look at the execution we’ve been able to make on our cost reductions, we feel pretty good about where we’re at.
Daniel Amir – Lazard Capital Markets: Okay and just one follow up question, can you expand a bit about one of your announcements this quarter I guess with Nanya and kind of what the strategy is there in terms of you know going forward, is this going to be more than just a technology sharing agreement or what’s kind of your thought process there?
Mark Durcan:  Daniel, this is Mark. A couple of things on that and then I can’t say too much because we’re still working through definitive agreements but we have said there’s really two major components to it, there’s a technology development component which really involves joint development of products as well as process technology on a go forward basis. And we think that’s a significant value to Micron as it drives down our operating expenses and drives a more efficient model for us. The other major component is a joint venture and the timing of that and the exact business plan we’re still working through but you can think of this in terms of a what we believe will be a capital efficient model and a capital efficient way for us to put leading edge and efficient production in place for the benefit of our business. And there’ll be more of that as we complete, more on that as we complete definitive agreements.
Daniel Amir – Lazard Capital Markets: Okay thanks a lot.
Operator:  And our next question comes from Tim Luke from Lehman Brothers, please go ahead sir.
Tim Luke – Lehman Brothers: Thanks so much. I was just wondering if you could give any color on your sense as how you think bit growth may proceed in the coming quarter in DRAM and in NAND. And then separately Mike if you have a sense of how if pricing was to stabilize from here, what will you be thinking about in terms of quarter over quarter price declines for the May period?
Mark Durcan:  This is Mark, let me take the bit growth and I’ll hand it over to Mike for the other. On the DRAM side we’re looking at mid to high single digits and we think that’s a good number for this quarter and moving forward over the next few quarters. Similarly for NAND, we think a good placeholder would be a 30-40% range quarter over quarter. And in both these numbers will be potentially be a little bit lumpy as production moves back and forth during these technology ramps.
Mike Sadler:  And on the pricing situation, Tim, again under the assumption that prices are flat going forward for the rest of the quarter which would be another eight weeks or so, on the DRAM side we would be down mid single digits percentage wise. And on the NAND flash side we’d be down in the mid 20’s from a percentage standpoint. And again the assumption on both is that pricing remains flat from where we are today.
Tim Luke – Lehman Brothers: If I may just ask Steve as a follow up, if you could give any color on how you perceive the op ex going forward, should we assume some fairly flat levels from the 120 in SG&A and 180 in R&D. And then also if you have any color on how you perceive your cash balance going forward. And then lastly just coming out of the Intel analyst meeting, it looked like some not total transparency of the visibility of their longer term commitment to the NAND business, if you could give any color on how you see the structure of the JV going forward or on the outlook for that. That would be very helpful.
Steve Appleton:  Sure. On the operating expenses as I noted the R&D I think was, I don’t want to say artificial but somewhat impacted by the timing of product qualifications, so we think that will come back down as we move forward and really come back into this kind of a 165-175 range. On the SG&A I don’t think it’s going to change a lot from where it is for this next quarter. But as I might note, both of those are down. Remember in fiscal year 08 we had just over $800 million in R&D and if you look at the numbers that we’re forecasting right now, it’s obviously going to be down you know something closer into the mid 6’s. So we’ve made progress on that in SG&A is coming down as well.  So I think it will come down, I don’t think there’s a lot of dramatic change from where it’s at today. But that’s primarily because we’ve made a lot of progress on it so far. On the cash balance, you know we, as I noted are in pretty good shape. We really preserved our cash balance pretty good quarter over quarter and we had operating cash flow of about $282 million. So you know I think the question that a lot of people get at is or that you might be trying to get at is how do we see our need to go raise cash in the future. And really we think we’re in pretty good shape. We don’t see any near term need to raise any money and we’ve balanced it with where we need the cap ex is and we feel pretty good about where we’re at. So I don’t think that’s an issue for us.  On the Intel joint venture and I noted a couple of times before, it’s actually going pretty well. You know despite the fact that we’ve had a pretty tough NAND market, the JV in terms of its operation has actually been ahead of schedule in terms of what it’s accomplishing on the technology and the ramp. So we feel pretty good about that. I don’t have any commentary that I know of coming from Intel leadership that they are interested in getting out of this joint venture.  So I guess I’d have to defer you back to Intel. From our perspective its gone pretty well. Obviously the market’s pretty tough but I think we still both view it as pretty strategic product area you know not only from where it’s at today but for where it’s going to move to in the future with SSGs and so forth so I think it’s still pretty strategic.
Tim Luke – Lehman Brothers: With no change to the big growth plan this year?
Steve Appleton:  No, nothing that would be significant, Mark do you want to make any comments?
Mark Durcan:  Yeah let me jump in, relative to this year there’s nothing, we’re still full speed ahead. We have made the decision with Intel relative to our IMFF fab that we will start that in the first half of 09. So that is a slight slip from what we had originally projected coming late in 08. But we think that’s just the right thing to do given current market conditions in the NAND market.
Steve Appleton:  Yeah just to add on to what Mark said you know we were pretty aggressive on trying to drive that new facility schedule and you know given the market conditions I think we just view it as we don’t need to be so aggressive, we can be less aggressive and a little more normalized about how we bring that on. And as Mark said, that’ll really be the first, probably the first part of 09 now.
Tim Luke – Lehman Brothers: Thanks so much guys.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Krishna Shankar from JMP Securities, please go ahead.
Krishna Shankar – JMP Securities: Yes as you look at the DRAM market what is your outlook for industry bit growth this year and do you see, you know you mentioned that the market was in relatively good balance. Do you see that tightening as we go forward into the May and the August quarter with the PC [bus] cycle, Intel’s [montarina] ramping and just increased box loadings.
Kipp Bedard: Krishna are you talking about bit supply or are you talking about bit demand at the customer level?
Krishna Shankar – JMP Securities: Actually if you could give color on both that’d be helpful.
Mike Sadler:  Okay, this is Mike I’ll comment on the demand side and then I think Kipp’s going to provide some input on the supply side. With respect to demand specifically from the computing community, from our PC customers you know I’ve taken a cross section here that’s pretty representative of the entire worldwide market and from a demand standpoint in calendar Q2, we’re looking at demand growth sequentially, so relative to calendar Q1 of about 12% on a bit basis.  And that ranges by the way from a low of minus 2% to a high of about 40% on sequential bit growth, bit demand growth in calendar Q2. For the year the same data rounds out to about 65% in terms of bit demand growth and the range there would be a low of about 49 and a high of about 105. And again that’s a good cross section of our customers which I think is a pretty fair representation of the overall market. Now what I believe is imbedded in here although again you’d have to get this directly from our customers, but I believe a unit growth rate somewhere in the neighborhood of 10-12% is what’s imbedded in here and the balance of course is driven by content growth.
Kipp Bedard:  Thanks Mike it looks like on the industry side, supply bit growth will come in, again based on current public comments, somewhere between 50-60% year over year.
Krishna Shankar – JMP Securities: Okay and on the NAND flash side, is there anything out there that could reverse this excess supply situation here whether it is the Apple 3G phone or other competitors coming out with 3G phones, what will be a couple of big factors you know tightening NAND supply out there?
Steve Appleton:  Well you know there is the announcement that [Hynex] made that they’re going to take the 200 millimeter offline which I saw a number that said it accounted for about 5% of the world’s supply, that’s actually pretty significant. On the supply side, Mike I don’t know if you have any the demand side?
Mike Sadler:  Well on the demand side we’re certainly, well I shouldn’t say certainly, we believe that we’ll get a strong demand growth in the near term when we head into the selling season for consumer electronics products. So essentially from back to school through the end of the year, you know Christmas and holidays, should be a much stronger demand profile for consumer electronics products which do drive a significant piece of the overall NAND flash demand.  We also believe that we’re going to see continue to see pretty strong elasticity growth as a result of lower NAND prices, higher density flash cards in the marketplace and so forth which is naturally going to drive demand. We are going to see some demand created from the introduction of solid state drives, actually today through the rest of the year although I don’t believe that one is going to be significant enough in 2008 to really swing things in favor of demand. And over the long haul just a more rational investment profile which matches what the demand profile looks like I believe is going to ultimately balance things out and whoever is the most cost efficient and has the best operation is going to be a winner and we think we’re in a pretty good position with respect to that.
Krishna Shankar – JMP Securities: Thank you.
Operator:  And our next question comes from Shawn Webster from J.P. Morgan, please go ahead sir.
Shawn Webster – J.P. Morgan: Okay, thanks for taking my questions. Can you ground us a bit on some of the February quarter bit production and bit shipment information for DRAM and NAND.
Mike Sadler:  Sure bit growth on the DRAM side was roughly flat quarter to quarter and NAND production bit growth was up nearly 30%.
Shawn Webster – J.P. Morgan: So DRAM production was flat sequentially?
Mike Sadler:  That’s correct.
Shawn Webster – J.P. Morgan: Okay, was there something that you guys changed in terms of your plan, I thought you were intending to grow your production in your February quarter?
Steve Appleton:  Yeah we actually changed the product mix and we moved wafers in favor of imagers.
Shawn Webster – J.P. Morgan: Okay. And in terms of the sensor business, can you talk about what that did sequentially in terms of revenues or units or give us some color on what was happening there.
Steve Appleton:  Yeah, revenues were down roughly 20% and we’re looking, our third quarter guidance would be up 5-10% in units.
Shawn Webster – J.P. Morgan: And then for your inventories, did I read it right that it was $15 million in the quarter in terms of the write down this quarter?
Steve Appleton:  Yeah our [NRV] was about $15 million for the quarter.
Shawn Webster – J.P. Morgan: Okay and then maybe stepping back a little bit, when you look at the landscape of your competitors and their relative cash positions, do you see any of the marginal players falling off sometime at this point sometime later this year or over the next year given the cash burn situation or do you see actual consolidation likely or any of those scenarios that could come to pass this year you think?
Steve Appleton:  I think that the, well I’ve said this before Shawn, I think that the industry needs to still have some consolidation it needs to go through. Clearly some of our competitors on their cash burn, it’s pretty high and you know I don’t know their ability to access the markets and continue on. So that’s tough for me to judge.  But we’ve been looking at the landscape pretty closely and I think what you’re saying is true that there’s a lot of pressure out there on these balance sheets and that they’re trying to figure out, in some of their cases how to survive or whether they ought to join up with somebody else to you know essentially consolidate the industry. And I guess the only other caveat is you know the longer the industry is in a downturn the more probability and the more candidates there become to become part of a consolidation.
Shawn Webster – J.P. Morgan: Okay and then maybe finally did your, can you tell us what your wafer growth was sequentially in your February quarter and how you expect that to evolve maybe next quarter or over the course of the year?
Mike Sadler:  Yup, same as last quarter, was up a couple percent in Q2 and that’s what we’re guiding to as well. Let me make sure I stated something as well, during the quarter the imaging units were down 19-20% but it remained approximately 10% of the total revenues. I think I mentioned that revenues were down 20 but it’s actually units were approximately 20.
Shawn Webster – J.P. Morgan: Okay, thank you for that. Thank you very much.
Operator:  And our next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse, please go ahead.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse: Yeah, good afternoon guys, thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple here, on the cap ex front we’re halfway through the fiscal year, you spent about $1.5 billion, you’re still throwing out a range of $2.5-$3, can you just help me understand what gets you to the low end of that range and what gets you to the high end and then I have a follow up.
Mike Sadler:  Well yeah there’s a couple things. As you know if you followed our fiscal year ends over the last several years, it’s just simply timing of the equipment installs and qualification can have a 2-300, even $400 million range. So that by itself is enough to be drive us anywhere through that. I think as Mark and Steve have alluded to, we keep a lot of flexibility in our cap ex budgets in a lot of different areas as well, so those two things would keep us in this range for now and of course we’ll keep you update on future calls.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse: Does the push out of Singapore albeit just a minor push out drive you to the lower end, is that what we should be thinking?
Steve Appleton:  It’s pretty minor, not really. You know it’s really this timing of a lot of the stuff that we’re doing and whether it hits exactly at the end of the quarter or not. If you look at us historically a lot of times we don’t end up spending $200-$300 million of the money that was in the budget that we thought would happen at that time because qualification or acceptance of [unintelligible] deliveries get pushed a little bit. 
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse: Just a follow up for Steve, Steve just given that you’re still viewing consolidation as something that needs to happen in the industry, can you help me understand your proposed joint venture with Nanya in light of that, are we supposed to assume that this joint venture helps the industry capacity and if it doesn’t, would you be better off being a consolidator instead of going through this sort of joint venture?
Steve Appleton:  Well, first of all, I don’t think they’re mutually exclusive. The fact that we did a joint venture and by the way I think it’s worth pointing for a lot of you that have heard me speak over the years, you know we don’t think that these foundry arrangements work but I think that true joint ventures work. The one we have with Intel is working well and the joint venture that we will have with Nanya we think will work pretty well. But that’s because we are truly co-developing and co-sharing if you will on trying to generate the most capital efficient model.  In other words, I think the way to look at these are you know we have consistently tried to make sure that we did not enable a competitor at a lower cost structure than our own in terms of how we structured these deals and in fact we haven’t done that. So clearly the other thing that we’re interested in is continuing to drive scale and op ex efficiency and that’s what we’re driving towards in this joint venture as well. I don’t think it’s a good assumption that because we are doing the joint venture that we wouldn’t also be interested in consolidation if the opportunity were to exist. So we continue to look at that as well.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse: Alright, thanks guys.
Operator:  And our next question comes from Glen Yeung from Citi, please go ahead sir.
Analyst for Glen Yeung – Citigroup:  Hi this is [Ji Hung] for Glen. Can you talk about the channel inventories that you’re seeing on the DRAM side?
Mike Sadler:  Sure, happy to, on the DRAM side I had two components of our customers, one would be the OEM customers for the PC manufacturers and other hardware manufacturers and the others would be I’ll call them the low value add customers or the speculators that are buying and holding and speculating on price increases or are adding a relatively small amount of value in the form of a module say, a PCB. On the OEM side I don’t believe that any of our customers have accumulated significant inventory if they have at all. And again as I’ve stated in the past, the only reason they would do so is to speculate or to hedge on price increases.  We are make business too easy for them to force them to accumulate inventories, we store the product right at their facilities. So it’s my observation that they are not accumulating any inventory. On the channel side, the speculators, I believe there is a fair amount of buying in anticipation of price increases and trying to take advantage of that. Having said that I don’t believe there is a significant amount of product in the channels. So it would really be difficult for me to quantify it but my sense is it’s not very significant. On the NAND flash side, however I believe there is quite a bit of inventory in the channel among those kind of third party speculators and that’s kind of fueling my perspective that we are in a pretty significantly over supplied situation on the NAND flash side.
Analyst for Glen Yeung – Citigroup:  Thanks and in your prepared comments you talked about some design wins with your DRAM and NAND products, into wireless handset OEMs, so can you talk a little bit about those design wins? Thanks.
Mike Sadler:  Sure, I can’t disclose who our customers are but you know I think you’re aware of who the large mobile handset makers are, there are only five of real significance. And the market is, as the market shifts from 2G to 2.5G to 3G the memory subsystems are shifting from a NOR based multichip packages to NAND based multichip packages and we have actually we are currently shipping in production and we are continuing to stack up a variety of design wins with our own silicon, so our own NAND flash silicon and our own low powered DRAM products in these MCPs. And it’s with multiple customers, it’s certainly not just with one.
Operator:  And our next question comes from Daniel Berenbaum from Caris & Company, please go ahead.
Daniel Berenbaum – Caris & Company: Yeah hi guys, you guys did obviously a great job on cost reduction in the quarter, can you talk about the path for cost reduction for both NANDs and DRAM over the next several quarters. And then also if you could just break out by a percentage of revenue, what percent was DRAM and what percent was NAND and if you could maybe look out into the future more importantly and maybe give us a way to think about when will NAND become a larger percentage of your revenue than DRAM given the push out of the Singapore fab.
Mark Durcan:  Okay Dan, this is Mark, let me talk a little bit to where the cost reductions are coming from on a go forward basis then I’ll let Mike handle the supply revenue breakdown piece. First of all as we’ve stated already, the cost reduction on cost per bit basis was about 15% on the DRAM and about 25% on the NAND. As we look to the future, the DRAM cost reductions are coming from incremental output in both [M]TV and Tech at 300 millimeters.  So incremental output at the leading edge, those would 78 nanometer and 68 nanometer wafers respectively. As we get into calendar Q3, we’ll start introduction of our 58 nanometer node in the Virginia fab and they’ll be a significant die size reductions as that technology rolls in. As we look to the NAND front it’s really a technology story. We have pretty solid approaching mature yields on the 50 nanometer node but in the third quarter you already start to see some output impact from the 30 or the sub 40 nanometer node that Mike alluded to earlier in the call. And that’s really going to drive the significant cost reductions in the second half of the year and into calendar 09.
Mike Sadler:  I’ll take the revenue breakout, during the quarter executed to about a 30% core DRAM percent of revenues, about mid 20’s in terms of specialty DRAM. As I mentioned earlier, imaging was approximately 10% and that leaves NAND at about the mid 30% range.
Daniel Berenbaum – Caris & Company: So any idea, just to come back to the cost reduction then, would you care to speculate on just the sequential percentages of cost reduction that we could think about due to these very aggressive programs that you have? And then also back to the breakout side, when should we think about NAND becoming a larger percentage than total DRAM?
Mike Sadler:  Sure, on the cost reductions we’ve been guiding 15% plus over the next few quarters and that’ll continue to be the case. And as Mark indicated earlier there will be periods of time where production is up higher than that 30-40% range that he mentioned. And of course that would correlate to even a faster cost decline similar to what we did this particular quarter. And on DRAM, same guidance as before, over the next few quarters we’ll average in that high single to low double digit range on cost reductions. And in terms of when NAND can be higher than DRAM revenues, I’m going to defer that because it’s always difficult to predict the ASP impact relative to that.
Daniel Berenbaum – Caris & Company: Okay, fair enough, thanks very much.
Operator:  And our next question comes from Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs, please go ahead sir.
Analyst for Jim Covello – Goldman Sachs: Hi this is Kate [Kazlarski] on behalf of Jim Covello. A quick question on NAND cap ex, clearly the NAND environment has been pretty difficult, I was just curious what your thoughts are about how bad it has to get before either you guys or some of your competitors might start thinking about potentially reducing some of their investments sort of similar to what we’re seeing in DRAM today? Thank you.
Mark Durcan:  The NAND cap ex, first of all I think there is some adjustment going on in the NAND production world today in that anybody that was out there producing on 200 millimeter is really thinking hard about getting out of producing NAND on 200 millimeter. I had referenced earlier that [Hynex] had announced that they were going to do that. I think others will do that as well. You know it’s worth pointing out for Micron, the percentage of NAND that we have on 300 millimeter I think is the highest or one of the highest of any company out there in the industry.  So for us, we are on primarily on the leading edge of 300 millimeter technology node in that, so that alone wouldn’t drive us to change our behavior. But I will say that we’ve already mentioned what we see going on in IMFS and that was really, that’s essentially the Micron Intel joint ventures mixed large expansion and so that is going to occur later than we originally thought it would occur. And I would imagine others are looking at the same thing. But I will say that with respect to Micron’s perspective moving forward, we’re still a much smaller player in the NAND industry than a couple of the other much larger players. So it’s probably a question that would be better to ask them and what they are thinking about doing to gauge what would happen with the industry on capacity expansion. I’ve already described to you what we’re doing.
Analyst for Jim Covello – Goldman Sachs: And just a quick follow up, in terms of the 200 millimeter capacity retirements that you had referenced, is your expectation that that capacity will be retired or would you anticipate that capacity to be replaced with 300 millimeter capacity in the industry?
Mark Durcan:  Well I think you’ll see a, I mean it’s kind of an evolving scenario where it can’t be replaced immediately because it’s virtually impossible to do. In the [Hynex] case they that they would have it offline in the next 60 days. But all I can tell you is what these others are reporting in the media. I will say this though, it would not be helpful to try to take that capacity and build DRAM with it.  I mean that is no solution for us either. And so I don’t think you’re going to see a shifting of 200 millimeter from NAND into DRAM. Whether or not that capacity can build something else is hard for me to know. Depending on what the product portfolio is, but I frankly don’t think that the 200 millimeter coming off at this point in time is really effecting too much decision around what companies are doing on 300 millimeter just because these things come on over long periods of time. And it’s a much more strategic thought process about adding 300 millimeter fabs.
Analyst for Jim Covello – Goldman Sachs: Okay and just a quick question on your depreciation, do you have an estimate for 2008 for D&A? Any change?
Steve Appleton:  Yeah, about $2.2 billion, so same as last guidance.
Analyst for Jim Covello – Goldman Sachs: Okay, thanks so much.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Hans Mosesmann from Raymond James, please go ahead sir.
Hans Mosesmann – Raymond James: Thanks, most of my questions have been answered but I do want to get a sense of how you see the environment. There’s a sense that things should be slowing down in the world of PCs, are you seeing normal seasonal trends in behavior of your PC OEM customers? What’s their outlook relative to the slowdown that could lead to slower than seasonal trends here entering the summer?
Mike Sadler:  Hans, this is Mike speaking, I don’t think the numbers, the data that we’re receiving from customers with respect to demand really exhibits any significant slowdown in absolute demand for their boxes. I reference that 12% quarter over quarter bit demand growth earlier and I don’t have historical data at my fingertips but my sense is that’s representative of you know a typical seasonal calendar Q2. So we’re not, I guess the short answer is, our customers are not portraying to us any type of a slowdown in demand yet certainly.
Hans Mosesmann – Raymond James: Thank you.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Doug Freedman from AmTech Research, please go ahead.
Doug Freedman – American Technology Research: Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. I guess if we could get a little bit of detail on Lexar and how Lexar is going and if you could discuss what you’re seeing as far as price trends in retail and average densities being bought there.
Mike Sadler:  Lexar, interesting enough in this time period has really been an advantage for us and I think probably the easiest way to describe it is that the price declines that occur in the retail channel are just simply not as steep as they have been in the component sells. So we’ve been able to really take advantage of that as that’s been a channel for us. Now it’s also worth pointing out that Lexar still buys from third parties as well, so we’re not a100% supplier to Lexar.  But they are buying more and more every quarter that goes by as we qualify and develop new products to go into that channel. And so Lexars actually done I think quite well. From a business model perspective as I mentioned at the analyst meeting, I mean they’ve really I think got on track and got more efficient and have started re-expanding if you will from where they were when they tried to retrench and get the business model in a much better shape. So it’s gone pretty well. And you know I guess I’d leave it at there if you had a more specific question I could try to answer it.
Doug Freedman – American Technology Research: Do you happen to have the average density that’s being purchased? And any changes there, are we seeing increased density in the retail channel for NAND?
Mike Sadler:  You know unfortunately Doug I don’t have that data with me, we’ll make sure to have it with us for the next time around on this with respect to the card density in retail. I would add just to what Steve said, I mentioned earlier that we’ve recently introduced our first Micron silicon that is compatible with a Micro SD card and we’re really bullish about this being a solid retail product for Lexar. It’s a 1 gigabit Micro SD card and it should be available in retail here over the next 30, 60 days or so.  Quite bullish about adding that to the product portfolio and just one other thing to what Steve mentioned on Lexar that the amount of revenue that we’re generating from Lexar via the NAND flash cards through retail is increasing every quarter we go forward. So we’re actually really happy to have this additional outlet if you will or this additional means of getting product into the hands of retailers. It’s working out quite well for us.
Doug Freedman – American Technology Research: Alright and staying on the NAND business, if we were to look at a little bit of mixed signals right now on NAND, your ASP delta or change is less than we heard from your other IMFT partner Intel at their recent analyst day, can you help the investors understand why there is such a disparity?
Mike Sadler:  Well we do have separate sales channels and actually we have several products that are different as well.
Steve Appleton:  Yeah I think it’s also worth noting that Lexar is in the mix for us. And you know there’s also a transfer price mechanism that happens from the joint venture to the two of us as well. And you know the differences there may explain some of it.
Doug Freedman – American Technology Research: Alright and I think a bunch of people have tried to ask and trying to understand your cap ex plans going forward and I’m a little surprised and having trouble reconciling why the push of the Singapore IMFT NAND fab doesn’t impact your spending plans given that that was expected to sort of come up at the end of this year and is now a 09 event.
Mark Durcan:  Well we’re not really giving guidance on 09 at this point. Remember our fiscal 08, we’re in the, we’re basically getting pretty close. So you know our fiscal 08 ends at the end of August and it just turns out that the timing of that really wasn’t much in terms of its impact on our fiscal 08.
Doug Freedman – American Technology Research: I see so.
Steve Appleton:  It’s just too late, I mean it just was coming too late in the year anyways. I mean the facility won’t even be complete until the summer. And as we look at trying to get it ready for equipping and installing equipment, there wasn’t a whole lot that was going to happen by the end of August anyhow.
Doug Freedman – American Technology Research: Alright and switching gears and moving over to the DRAM business. Percentage of 1 gigabit shipments and your share there in that market?
Mike Sadler:  Yeah we’re over 50% now in 1 gig and above. I can’t tell you what our percent of share is off the top of my head, but our shipments themselves are over 50%.
Doug Freedman – American Technology Research: And then given the low pricing that we’ve seen in the DRAM market, what’s the elasticity and what are you guys seeing as far as average box loading there?
Mike Sadler:  Yeah, Dough I showed a slide earlier with average box loading and if I recall it’s in the neighborhood of 1.7-1.8 gigabits per system today and you know the elasticity, I sure sense that it’s starting to kick in here pretty significantly. But we don’t see an immediate impact. But today’s price levels which is essentially you know $18.00 per gigabit is certainly seems like a compelling value add for our customers to put more and more memory in their systems and you know I think that’s represented by the demand data that I shared with you earlier.
Doug Freedman – American Technology Research: Alright, can you guys offer us some sort of insight into what type of memory we can expect to see going into some of these new ultra mobile devices that Intel is going to be pushing with their new low cost processors?
Mike Sadler:  Today the boxes that I’m aware of today are using our DDR 2 memory and some of them are going to transition to DDR 3. Those that are trying to push high performance and or power savings. But it’s DDR 2 memory today in either our 1 gigabit or 2, 1 gigabit modules, something in the range of 1 to 2 gigabits of DDR 2 memory.
Doug Freedman – American Technology Research: Alright my last question really Steve for you, are we seeing any impact on your gross margins from commodity prices? I mean clearly we’ve seen some pretty healthy spikes in gold and copper and wondering if you’re seeing any impacts from that?
Steve Appleton: Well we haven’t really seen too much on the materials side. So I haven’t, I mean our cost reductions are continuing to come down as rev queued to the model and obviously anything that would be happening on the materials side would be included in that. But it’s not significant enough to change our execution course.
Doug Freedman – American Technology Research: Alright, great, thanks so much.
Operator:  Our next question is from John Lau from Jefferies & Co., please go ahead.
Analyst for John Lau – Jefferies & Co.: Hello, this is Raul [Kalmeker] calling in for John Lau. My first question was could you tell us the contributions from our branded businesses, [Exer] and [Crusion], how much was that?
Mike Sadler:  We don’t break that out for you, I’m sorry.
Analyst for John Lau – Jefferies & Co.: Okay, my second question is about your SSD business, I understand that for NAND prices, the prices have fallen almost 70% year over year, so SSDs must be getting competitive in quite a few segments in the notebook market. So is it making, has it started making significant contribution to your business and what is your outlook for that?
Mike Sadler:  Well it has not made a significant contribution to our business yet, primarily because we just introduced our first solid state drive to the marketplace less than 60 days ago, I think within the past, certainly within the past quarter. And it is an SLC based solid state drive which we don’t expect much significant revenue generation from at all. In terms of penetration in the notebook market, that is going to require MLC flash and we will have our first product in the market in the second half of this year and actually we’re quite bullish on that product becoming significant in terms of revenue generation, not perhaps in the second half of this year because there will be some latency in terms of market uptake, but it should be a very strong revenue contributor for us in fiscal year 2009.  We are dialoguing with virtually all of the PC OEMs today about working on placing that product in their mobile computing platforms here as we move through this year into the next year. So we’re quite bullish on MLC NAND penetration in the mobile computer for performance reasons and as well as referencing the cost reductions that you mentioned earlier. It’s also worth mentioning on the topic of solid state drives, the complete other end of the spectrum with respect to the market is the enterprise market and we’re not really looking at dollars per gigabit there as being a primary demand driver but its more dollars per transaction. And in that area we are approaching it with SLC NAND and we have some significant inroads there with some of the enterprise customers about potentially introducing that product in their lineup later on this year and in 2009 as well. So quite bullish on the solid state drive market with respect to our product offerings.
Analyst for John Lau – Jefferies & Co.: Okay and in terms of litigation, what is your annual run rate for legal expenses?
Mark Durcan: We don’t break that out for you either.
Analyst for John Lau – Jefferies & Co.: Okay and could you just give us an update on where you think the litigation against Rambus is going to go and what your position is about it?
Mark Durcan:  Well the case that just finished was an antitrust fraud case against Rambus, it was not a patent litigation, it was not a patent infringement case. We as of this point in time do not have a trial date set for the patent infringement case that’s anytime in the near future. So that’ll happen sometime later this year, maybe sometime next year. And we’re just continuing on that course. Of course we’re going to appeal the decision that just occurred but I think it’s worth noting that that’s not a patent infringement case, that was an antitrust fraud case that was against Rambus.
Analyst for John Lau – Jefferies & Co.: Okay, thanks a lot.
Operator:  And the final question comes from Bill Desellum from Titan Capital Management, please go ahead.
Bill Desellum – Titan Capital Management:  Thank you we had a couple of questions relative to the Nanya relationship that you have announced. In terms of us trying to understand how this helps lead to a structural change in the industry, when you were referencing before the sharing of R&D, essentially would we be looking at some of the, taking this quarter for example, $180 million or R&D that you expensed, some of that would end up flowing through Nanya’s business and coming off of your income statement? Is that correct first of all and also are there other aspects of structural change to the industry that it would represent?
Mike Sadler:  We don’t view our joint venture with Nanya as a big structural change in the industry. Obviously it may have implications on other players but for us we just view it as very strategic in terms of scale and R&D efficiency. And what you pointed out I think will in fact be the case that right now we have a certain run rate on developing R&D for DRAM and you know we don’t expect that run rate to change significantly as a result of the joint venture with Nanya.  And as they cost share with us the development of leading edge technology then obviously that will reduce the R&D bill that we have for it as a standalone entity. And by the way this is very true with respect to what happened with our joint venture with Intel, I mean we were both sharing that equally as well and that has just made us much more efficient on the development of the technology. And we would expect the same thing to occur with the joint venture with Nanya.
Bill Desellum – Titan Capital Management:  And then relative to the production issues taking place in the industry you had reference the [Hynex] 200 millimeter NAND line that has or is planned to come down, are there other changes of note that you have seen that are significant like that?
Mike Sadler:  Well I don’t have anything that’s not already out and been published in the media. You know there are other companies talking about, I think first of all, I mean we have seen other reports about 200 millimeter DRAM coming offline. And we’re now seeing the reports about 200 millimeter NAND coming offline. The other thing that there has been a number of announcements, quite a few pushes in cap ex.  Either because the companies can’t get access to money with which to buy the cap ex or because they’re trying to conserve their balance sheet. And that’s primarily of course been in the DRAM arena where we’ve seen that as well. So I mean I think there was real change going on right now in the industry around capacity but as you know from following the industry for a long time, there’s a lag affect from when we see the benefit of that.
Bill Desellum – Titan Capital Management:  Great, thank you.
Kipp Bedard:  Thank you Bill and with that we’d like to thank everyone for participating on the call today. If you will please bear with me I need to repeat the safe harbor protection language.

I’d like to now turn the call over to Mr. Steve Appleton.Steve. 
Steven R. Appleton: Thanks, Kipp. Let me just give a quick update on the CFOscenario. I think most people know that months ago, we announced that BillStover would be leaving the company and in fact, he did leave at the end oflast month, which coincided with the end of our quarter and I am interim CFO atthis time.  However, I fully expect that this will be the onlyconference call that I am the interim CFO and that we have been in the processof reviewing both internal and external candidates and believe that we’ll getthat wrapped up this quarter.  So in the interim, I’ll cover some of the financialmaterial. For those that did not see the release, we ended up with revenues ofabout $1.53 billion and I’ll note that that was about 7% growth over lastquarter. Mike will cover it later but of course both DRAM and NAND were undersignificant price pressure for the quarter and we did report a loss of $262million. I’ll also note that there was a $62 million in our re-charge to COGSfor finished goods that was in that number.  On the manufacturing cost side, we did have good news. The300-millimeter ramps at Lehigh and Singapore continued to make really strongprogress -- 
Unidentified Speaker: Sir, are you still looking for Lithium Motors, correct?
Steven R. Appleton: I think we have somebody on the call that’s talking on someother lines. Not hear with us in the room but on a different line, so let mejust continue. So on the manufacturing cost side, as I said, the 300-millimeterramps at Lehigh and Singapore made pretty good progress and just to note thatthe DRAM costs were down about 10% and the NAND costs were down really kind ofmid-double-digits quarter over quarter and we think that we’ll be able tocontinue that trend as we’ve stated before.  Also good news, on the operating expense side, we have notedthat we’ve been working on that pretty diligently and in fact, if you look atthe data, in 2007 we averaged about 25% for operating expenses as a percent ofrevenue. In fact, in Q1, we got that down just below 18%, 17.9%. And if youbreak that out between SG&A and R&D, our Q1 dropped to $120 millionfrom $143 million and our R&D dropped in Q1 to $163 million from $184million.  Now, a couple of notes on this; the SG&A, just becauseof some litigation costs and so forth we think will probably be in the mid-120sfor this quarter coming up and on the R&D, you should expect for it to beabout the same as it was this quarter, as we move through the holidays andobviously we’ve got a few other activities that are going on in the quarter.  So we think net net, pretty good. Obviously the market hasbeen under a lot of pressure from pricing but in terms of the objectives thatwe set out to accomplish on the operating expense line and the cost line, wefeel pretty good about it.  Switching over to really the CapEx and the balance sheet,our capital expenditures are still consistent with what we have said before. Weexpect it to be about $2.5 billion for fiscal ’08. It’s also probably worthnoting that that capital is pretty front-end loaded. We had about $900 millionthat we spent in this first quarter. Obviously the vast majority of our CapExcontinues to go to 300-millimeter. I’ll also note that we have, we still haveover $2 billion in cash and just to help people understand the cash position ofthe company, as I said we have over $2 billion in cash. We’ve spent about $900million of the $2.5 billion that we expect to spend already in this quarter,and it looks like cash flow from operations for fiscal ’08 will be between $1.5billion and $2 billion as well, so I think that can give you a pretty good ideaof where we sit on cash and we think we’re in good shape.  So with that, I am going to turn it over to Mike Sadler tomake some commentary on sales and the market. 
Michael W. Sadler: Thanks, Steve. We had another solid sequential growthquarter with megabit shipments of DRAM and NAND up approximately 25% and 60%respectively and imaging units up about 15% quarter over quarter. In fact,despite the unprecedented market price pressure, we managed to achieve fiscalQ1 revenue growth of about 7% on a sequential basis.  We can look primarily to the diversified DRAM productportfolio for insulating us somewhat from the ASP declines observed in the purecommodity market. As an illustration, the DDR2 spot market price declined 45%from the midpoint of our fiscal Q4 to the midpoint of fiscal Q1, while theaggregate average selling price per megabit for our basket of DRAM productsdeclined by only 20% in that same period.  This tough market environment is supply driven and primarilya result of capacity expansions occurring industry wide from 2005 through 2007.Demand for our products continues to be quite strong. In fact, the primarymarkets driving demand for our memory and imaging devices, the PC and mobilephone markets, are experiencing extraordinary growth.  Each of these markets will grow units between 12% to 15% in2007 and most market researchers are pegging the compound annual growth ratesin the range of 12% to 15% for each of these markets over the next five years.  Independent of the market environment, our technologydevelopment and deployment moves ahead and we recently rolled out some excitingnew technologies and products. We showed initial silicon of the one-gigabitDDR2 DRAM device on our advanced 68-nanometer process. This is an approximately25% die size reduction from our already industry-leading one-gigabit chip onthe 78-nanometer process. We anticipate this process moving to volumeproduction at our Singapore fabrication facility some time in mid-2008 and itwill serve as a platform for continued aggressive cost reduction on a varietyof other DRAM products.  In the NAND space, rollout of our 50-nanometer process inthe Virginia and Utah fabs is tracking ahead of schedule. The vast majority ofour NAND shipments in the current quarter are MLC chips on this 50-nanometernode.  On the product front, we are now in volume production ofDDR3 devices for next generation computing applications and recently announcedour entry into the solid state drive market with a variety of SLC and MLC basedserial interface drives.  Neither are big demand drivers today, although we believe thatthese memory product families will help ensure our themes of growth and productdifferentiation heading into 2009 and beyond.  In fiscal Q1, our imaging business experienced healthy unitand revenue growth. We are certainly getting a boost from a seasonal mobilephone and PC demand and realizing the benefits of a broadened and more balancedcustomer base. By no means is the image sensor business immune from marketprice pressures, particularly at one megapixel density and below.  We’ve managed, however, to keep our own average sellingprices relatively flat as we migrate the business towards higher pixeldensities. Our plan is to continue leveraging technological advantages todeliver superior image quality and better cost performance to our customers inthe mobile phone, PC, automotive, and security spaces.  The combination of image sensors and more specialized memoryproducts, such as SLC NAND, low power, and legacy DRAM are making good use ofour 200-millimeter capacity. We believe the economic viability of this modelfor somewhat specialized products should continue in the foreseeable future.  No question that the market environment is challenging, tosay the least. The market challenges, however, present various opportunitiesfor advancement and intermediate to long-term value creation. Micron is notfully insulated from market price pressures, although we believe that on arelative basis, our strong balance sheet, as Steve referenced, our diversifiedproduct portfolio, advanced technology platform and growing economies of scalehave us in position to come out of this cycle a much stronger company.  I’ll turn it back to Kipp and we’ll take some questions. 
Kipp A. Bedard: Thanks, Mike and as Mike alluded to, we’d like to now takequestions from callers. And just a reminder, if you are using a speaker phone,please pick up the handset when asking a question so we can hear you clearly.With that, we’d like to open up the line. 
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Jim Covello. 
Jim Covello - GoldmanSachs: Good afternoon. Appreciate you taking the time today. Thequestion is really on the supply side -- how concerned are you that Samsungjust seems so intent on keeping this market in excess supply to try and hurtsome of the marginal players in Taiwan, let’s say, that it could be a long timebefore this thing gets a lot better when you have maybe somebody acting alittle irrationally like that?
Steven R. Appleton: It’s probably hard for us to comment on Samsung’smotivations and what they are trying to do, but if you look at the data inaggregate in terms of the investment going into the sector, in particularly inDRAM, I think you’d look at it as -- and we think that the output as well, it’sprobably peaking in this timeframe. And whether it’s plus or minus a quarter isalways hard for us to know, but the equipment guys will tell you the samething, that the CapEx is coming down in aggregate for the industry. And then infact, we’re feeling the effects of I think what everybody would acknowledge wasa pretty big expansion year in capacity in ’07.  I think there will be weaker players that are probablyvulnerable to something happening in the industry but we’ll just have to seehow that plays out as we move through ’08. 
Jim Covello - GoldmanSachs: Okay, and then in terms of what you guys could do, there’sthings you can control and things you can’t and some of the things that you hadroughly alluded to maybe a couple of calls ago was -- and again, you didn’t saythis so I don’t want to put words in your mouth, but partnerships or jointventure kind of arrangements that might help to combine some people’s bestdesigns with some other people’s capacities. Any update on thoughts aroundthat? Any luck making progress on that with your discussions with others in theindustry?
Steven R. Appleton: First of all, we did that in the NAND business, so I assumeyou are talking about the DRAM business?
Jim Covello - GoldmanSachs: Correct. 
Steven R. Appleton: And the DRAM front, clearly Micron has been a company thathas taken advantage of opportunities when the market has been extremely weakand this is really the first collapse that you’ve seen in the industry reallyprobably since we took Toshiba out of the mainstream DRAM business.  So we are continuing to look at what opportunities might beout there and if they surface, then of course we are interested. In addition tothat, I think you made reference to it, we are trying to look at our model. Ifyou back up five years ago, only one of the five primary developers of thetechnology actually partnered with anybody to have their product produced andnow there are really three out of the five doing it, primarily Samsung andMicron not doing it. So we’ve got to look at that model and see if there issome benefit for us to extract out of that, but really we don’t have anythingto announce today. We’re just continuing to look at it and see if it makessense for us. 
Jim Covello - GoldmanSachs: Great. Thank you and good luck. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer. 
Amit Saraf - CreditSuisse: Thanks. This is Amit Saraf calling in for John. First, I wasjust wondering if you could clarify our CapEx. I think I read in the pressrelease, it said $2.5 billion to $3 billion, and I recall earlier you talkingmore about just $2.5 billion. Has there been any change to your CapEx guidancefor the next fiscal year and how would it break down between NAND and DRAM?
Steven R. Appleton: Well, we haven’t really changed any guidance. If youremember, if you go back up a quarter or two ago, I really said we thought itwould be between $2 billion and $3 billion. I think in the press release, we’rejust trying to narrow the range for you, if you will.  But let me just say a caveat, that we look at this market aswe go throughout the year and our best guess right now is in this $2.5 billionrange and realistically, it could move around a few hundred million on eitherside, depending on what we decided to do as we moved towards the end of ’08. 
Amit Saraf - CreditSuisse: And can you just break that down between NAND and DRAM? Howdo you see that split and how does that compare to fiscal year ’08?
Steven R. Appleton: Well, fiscal year -- 
Amit Saraf - CreditSuisse: Or fiscal year ’07, sorry. 
Steven R. Appleton: Yeah, fiscal year ’07 I think you will -- I don’t have thenumbers right in front of me and maybe Kipp can get them -- clearly ’07 wasdominated by NAND because we had the 300-millimeter equipment install in Utah.I think you will see that mitigated somewhat in ’08, although just keep in mindwe are finishing out the ramp, if you will, of Utah, and so there is somecarryover from there. And then the new fab is IMFS, which is really underconstruction for shellnow, so as we -- and we have been optimizing the output at a couple of thefacilities, particularly look at Virginia and I think we’ve been looking atCapEx there for additional DRAM to come out of that facility.  Soyou might see a trend back a little bit towards DRAM but frankly, I think stillthe most of it that is showing up right now will be the finish out of Utah andsome of the shell construction in Singapore. 
Amit Saraf - CreditSuisse: Okay, and then just on the demand side for DRAM, you mentionedstrength in the PC and mobile market. Can you talk about the PC marketspecifically going in 1Q and then also comment a little on the Vista uptake --where are we in that cycle and do you see that accelerating in the near-term?
Steven R. Appleton: Before Mike answers that, I did want to make one other notehere -- our tech facility, Tech Semi in Singapore is in the middle of a300-millimeter conversion, so that’s one of the reasons that you’ll see itshift back, is because they are in their 300-millimeter ramp as we speak rightnow and obviously installing CapEx and ramping. Go ahead, Mike. 
Michael W. Sadler: Sure. On our views on the PC market through dialoging withour customers are, as you are fully aware, notebook market continues to be onfire in terms of growth and our customers are projecting a similar type ofscenario unfolding as we roll through the holiday period and into the new year.And that’s going to be the primary growth driver from a unit standpoint.  In terms of the down stream demand that’s creating for DRAM,a sampling of some of our larger customers, which are representative of thelargest DRAM consumers in the world, indicating calendar Q1 DRAM demand upabout 4% relative to calendar Q4 and that would be a range from 0% to about 8%or 9%, depending on the particular customer. So a pretty healthy calendar Q1 iswhat is being projected from a DRAM consumption standpoint.  You asked a question about Vista. To date, our view of Vistaand again, getting this from our customers, is that it’s primarily been aconsumer product. There is going to be a rollout of a service pack for Vista inthe first quarter, which should make the product more attractive tocorporations. And this is really beyond our area of expertise, so I’d be hesitantto comment, to editorialize too much on it but we should expect to see somekind of demand kicker in the corporate area for Vista as we roll throughcalendar Q1.  Generally speaking on the content side, somewhatsurprisingly, if you just follow the statistics, the memory content per box onthe PC side has expanded but not extraordinarily and there has been not atremendous amount of demand elasticity based on the pricing environment.  Some of our customers have experienced some concern aboutthe direction of DRAM pricing going forward and the predictability of it and Iwould share those same kinds of concerns, concerns and questions. And that’swhy I think they’ve been a little bit gun-shy in terms of cranking up DRAMcontent significantly.  So I think as soon as they get a feeling that pricing isgoing to be relatively predictable, if they get that feeling, I think they’llfeel a little bit more bullish about cranking up the content. But as it istoday, we are hanging around 1.5 gigabytes per system and haven’t seen anythingextraordinary in terms of big content moves up that you would naturally expect,given the price degradation that we’ve seen.
Amit Saraf - CreditSuisse: Sounds good. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Wong. 
David Wong - WachoviaCapital Markets: Thank you very much. Can you give us some idea with yourcurrent CapEx plans what sort of bit production growth you expect fiscal ’08over fiscal ’07 for NAND and for DRAM?
Steven R. Appleton: Well, first of all, our bit production growth, we have beenessentially on the DRAM side, I think we’ve been saying that it’s going to bein the mid/low double-digits, somewhere in that neighborhood. And then on theNAND side, we think it’s kind of quarter over quarter running in this 40%range.  But I need to make the caveat that both tech and the300-millimeter conversion and Utah and their ramp, they are always slightlyunpredictable in the exact timing. So sometimes they move higher through theyields in the ramps than others. But in general, I think you could expect thatquarter over quarter through fiscal ’08. 
David Wong - WachoviaCapital Markets: Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Vassily. 
Kevin Vassily -Pacific Crest Securities: Thanks for taking my call. Two quick questions; one, did youhave to write down any of your NAND inventory? And then a second question onNAND; you grew bits about 60% in the quarter and I think that was about 20percentage points higher than what you alluded to on your last call. Can youcomment on what drove that delta?
Steven R. Appleton: On the first question about the NRV, we had NRV on both NANDand DRAM. We did not have one on imaging.  And in terms of the bit growth, it’s just gone -- I think ingeneral, we’ve been pleasantly surprised and we’ve said that for severalquarters now that both the ramp schedule on the 300-millimeter and the yieldimprovements have been ahead of plan, and that’s primarily driving the greaterbit growth. 
Kevin Vassily -Pacific Crest Securities: Did yield or the ramp drive the greater proportion of thebit growth?
Steven R. Appleton: I would say it’s been the yield that’s driven the greaterproportion to this point. 
Kevin Vassily -Pacific Crest Securities: Great. Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bob [Cohaverti].
Bob Cohaverti: Just a question -- your Lexar business, I know you don’tgive specific guidance, but I know you can take advantage of non-captivecapacity. Did it grow more than 60% or less than 60% of the overall NANDbusiness?
Steven R. Appleton: I’m not sure I understand the question, Bob, but let me saythat -- let me just first give a response and then you can tell me if we didn’tget to it or not. The percentage of supply that is coming internally as opposedto externally into Lexar, first of all, has been growing pretty steadily. So Ithink that first of all, ask it in that context, we’ve been supply more andmore internally than we have externally into that business for obvious reasons.I mean, we’re a bigger producer of it today and their business is actually,from our perspective, doing pretty well. You know, it’s probably worth sayingthat again, as I said on the last call, we’ve been pretty pleased with Lexar andit’s meeting the objectives that we had.  Go ahead, to break down your question if there’s somethingfurther. 
Bob Cohaverti: No, just curious. You are obviously supplying more and moreinternally, you get internal production, but I am pretty sure you have somesupply arrangement for Lexar as well, so you can -- 
Steven R. Appleton: Oh, yeah, absolutely. 
Bob Cohaverti: You can [inaudible] a little bit by taking some non-captivesupply into Lexar as well, so I was just kind of curious if Lexar is takingadvantage of both your internal organic bit growth plus some non-captivecontracts as well. 
Steven R. Appleton: Well, in terms of -- yeah, I think the answer is yes, theyare. I don’t know the breakout between which one was greater they are trying totake advantage of. They clearly still have supply from the outside, which issubstantial. And I think they’ll continue to do that. I mean, that’s the modelthat we want to run with them, is that they have dual supply sources becauseobviously we have a customer base outside of Lexar as well that we have toservice and we don’t want that being too high a percentage of what we do. 
Bob Cohaverti: Fair enough. I look at your DRAM ASP, pretty good job interms of avoiding some of the declines in the commodity space. Do you thinkthere is an opportunity to do that in NAND as well? I mean, if you look at SLC,spot pricing might not be 100% accurate but it’s held up reasonably wellcompared to MLC. Is there an opportunity to mix more specialized NAND in thereto keep your ASPs a little bit more stable?
Steven R. Appleton: Well, Mike can jump in here too. I think you have to look atour NAND business in two different ways. One is the component supply business,which I don’t think NAND today has differentiated enough to allow us to get apremium over the other producers. Remember, when you think about the NANDproducers and their capabilities and their product portfolio, we’re prettysimilar. I mean, these are the big guys as we think of in the memory businesslike us. They are not smaller companies that maybe don’t have the resources todo the portfolio that we have, and I think that’s in general pretty tough forus to differentiate today.  Now having said that, by the way, the product mix itself,SLC versus MLC and there are differences in price and premiums along thoselines, the fact that we’re able to benefit from some of that I don’t think issubstantially different from the other players that we’re competing againstbeing able to benefit from that as well, because they both have thoseportfolios. The other part of our business though where I think we areseeing a benefit today and maybe over a couple of the others is, as you alreadynoted, Lexar for us. We’re in the retail channel. If you look at the reset pricingin the retail channel, it doesn’t really coincide with what happens in thecomponent business, and for a variety of reasons.  The fact that we are able to move a lot of product throughthat channel I think has actually been a positive for us as opposed to maybeothers that didn’t have that channel directly.  In fact, I think it’s -- we said this last quarter and we’llsay it again -- that the margin for Lexar has been positive for us and we likethe story that it’s playing for us right now. 
Bob Cohaverti: Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Krishna Shankar. 
Krishna Shankar - JMPSecurities: What is your outlook for NAND demand going into the firstquarter of 2008? Can you talk about NAND bit demand trends going into Q1?
Michael W. Sadler: I don’t have nearly as good a read on the NAND demand,primarily because it’s just not nearly as mature a market, as I do on the DRAMdemand. But my expectations are that NAND demand in aggregate in calendar Q1 willbe down from calendar Q4 because of the strong consumer tie to the MP3 marketand the flash card market and the digital still camera market and so forth. SoI would expect that on an absolute basis, demand is going to be down incalendar Q1 relative to calendar Q4. 
Krishna Shankar - JMPSecurities: Okay, and the number that Steve referred to, low to midsingle digit DRAM, that’s bit production on a quarterly basis for DRAM and 40%or so for NAND. Is that right?
Steven R. Appleton: Very similar to what we’ve been posting, around 10% ongoingin quarterly formats for DRAM and yes, we are going to average around 40% overthe next several quarters in NAND. 
Krishna Shankar - JMPSecurities: And finally, can you give us an update on your restructuringand strategic efforts? You had mentioned that in previous conference calls interms of looking at options for the CMOS imaging business. 
Steven R. Appleton: Yeah, we -- I’m sorry, I’ve already commented on theoperating expense line and some of the restructuring there. With respect toimaging, as I said the last time, we don’t have any plans to changemanufacturing the product. We’ve been looking at ways -- really, is there someother partnership that’s a better way to take that product to market after it’sbeen produced, so to speak, and we’re just still in the middle of trying towork through that and figure out what the best path is. 
Krishna Shankar - JMPSecurities: Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Atiq Malik.
Atiq Malik : Thanks for taking my question and nice job on the operatingexpense side. You comments on CapEx, you mentioned that your CapEx is going tobe front end loaded. If I hear the Korean guys, I think they are alsopostulating that their CapEx is going to be front end loaded and so it seemslike all guys are behaving the same way. They are trying to add capacity in thefirst half for a better second half. Wouldn’t that imply that the supply willget worse from here?
Steven R. Appleton: Well, it’s hard for us to know the supply number. And by theway, when I say front-end loaded, that means it’s a quarter that we alreadyended, so the $900 million that I referenced was in our Q1. The others, as theymove throughout ’08, I don’t know for sure although I’ve also heard a lot ofcommentary about push-outs and cut-backs, but -- so it’s hard for us to knowwhat they are doing.  For us, our front-end loaded has already happened orhappening as we speak. 
Atiq Malik : I understand. And then a question on your -- at yourshareholder meeting, you mentioned that you are getting close to announcing thelocation of a 300-millimeter DRAM fab. And going back to Jim Covello’s questionon partnerships and consolidation, wouldn’t that imply that you are not lookingat partnerships too seriously if you are thinking about your next DRAM fab?
Steven R. Appleton: No, not at all. In fact, if you think about the dynamicsthat we have before, I think that we could take advantage of both, actually,and have it work just fine for us. The internal decision is of course we haveinfrastructure in various places and we can look at greenfields and so forthbut in addition to that, you know, if we do it in partnership, that partnershipwill obviously have some capacity associated with it but it’s also drivenaround trying to see if there is a better cost model in the development side,which obviously is a direct benefit back to us if we are able to distributethose costs over not only more capacity but among a couple of us in terms ofthe true development of it.  So they are both -- both of those are still in play and weare still looking at them pretty hard. 
Atiq Malik : And one last one on the specialized memory pricingenvironment; most memory makers are planning to use their obsolete 200-millimeterfabs for specialized memory products. How would that impact the pricingenvironment in this market going forward?
Michael W. Sadler: An unnatural growth of supply would likely have the effectof putting some supply pressure in place in the marketplace, although franklywe’ve been hearing a lot of this rhetoric over the last couple of years aboutother DRAM suppliers trying to follow our model of having a more diversifiedproduct portfolio and pricing has been relatively stable in the low power DRAMarea and the legacy DRAM area.  I think that’s primarily because the end products that theseDRAMs are going into are -- the DRAM bill of material cost is not tremendouslysignificant in terms of an overall cost driver and as a result, there is notnearly as much price pressure and there is quite a bit more sensitivity towardsreliability and quality of the devices as opposed to trying to save a nickelhere and there. And as a result, I feel like we are in a pretty secure positionthere. 
Atiq Malik : Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann.
Hans Mosesmann -Nollenberger Capital Partners : Thanks. A clarification on the growth for -- on the DRAMfront of 0% to 8%, is that for the overall PC DRAM market? And how does thatrelate for seasonality? Thanks. 
Michael W. Sadler: That takes into account the seasonality and that is for the-- basically a sampling of our computing customers, so that would encompassnotebooks, desktops, workstations, and servers. And it does take into accountthe seasonality, so that’s calendar Q1 over calendar Q4. 
Hans Mosesmann -Nollenberger Capital Partners : So you’re saying it’s seasonal? That that is normalseasonality, more or less?
Michael W. Sadler: Normal seasonality in terms of demand, DRAM demand in the PCenvironment I believe would be flat to down about 5% and what I’m telling youis it’s slightly better than that, flat to up about 8%. 
Hans Mosesmann -Nollenberger Capital Partners : Okay, and a follow-up; if ASPs hold at current levels,whatever they may be today here on the 20th of December, what would they doquarter over quarter on the DRAM front? 
Michael W. Sadler: If DRAM ASPs -- keep in mind we are three weeks into ourfiscal Q2 and if our average selling price for the balance of the quarterremains flat, our DRAM ASP quarter over quarter would be down about 10% to 15%.NAND, by the way -- you didn’t ask, but I’ll throw it out there anyway -- theNAND flash prices would be down -- this would be NAND on trade sales basisonly, so our sales directly to customers, they would be down about 40% quarterover quarter if they stayed flat from here. 
Hans Mosesmann -Nollenberger Capital Partners : Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Lau. 
John Lau - Jefferies& Company: Thanks. I know -- I may have missed it but I was wonderingif you can give a quick breakdown on the revenues in the different productlines, and Steve, what do you think your long-term goal is for DRAM as apercentage of total sales? Thank you. 
Kipp A. Bedard: I can do a little bit of that for you, John, up front; coreDRAM ran in the 30 -- mid to high 30 range for part of revenues. Specialty DRAMwas up into -- let’s see, 20s. Imaging was around 11% and NAND for the firsttime cracked over 40%. 
John Lau - Jefferies& Company: And when you said 35% of revenues for the core DRAM, whatdid you -- what was the commentary that you made for the 28%, I’m sorry?
Kipp A. Bedard: Mid-20s was specialty DRAM. 
John Lau - Jefferies& Company: Mid-20s was specialty -- and a long-term goal for DRAM?
Kipp A. Bedard: Well, that’s going to be more dependent on marketconsiderations. I think Steve and the team has done a pretty good job ofgetting us in a situation where we can move capacity around to take advantageof certain market opportunities. Like for example, right now we are puttingmore wafers back into imaging and specialty DRAM so specifically in Q2, youmight see more of a flattish production bit number even though we are going toaverage more like 10.  So we are going to give you some general ranges here andjust expect us to move capacity to where it’s most advantageous for us. 
Steven R. Appleton: Let me just add some commentary to what Kipp said. I thinkthe reason we don’t have a specific number is because we are going to move itaround dependent upon what the market is doing, but in general by the time weget into probably late ’08, we’ll have the ability to dial back and forth. ButI think the way to think about it is we could probably go 60-40 either way. 
John Lau - Jefferies& Company: That’s a very interesting comment, Steve. I was wonderingjust as a follow-up to try to put a finer point on it, when you talk about yourflexibility and your swing capacity, how long would it take for you to makethose adjustments? Is that something that can occur within six months or wouldit take a year or short than that to kind of react to those market conditions?
Steven R. Appleton: At least our historical experience has been around fourmonths. Now, let me just add that on the flash side, of course, we have apartner and typically we are motivated in the same direction because one willbe stronger versus the other and when that happens, then we both tend to wantto move in the same direction. But you’ve got to go through that processbecause they are our partners and we have to work through it. It could maybetake slightly longer but in general, I think you’d see it all happen withinprobably that four month timeframe. 
John Lau - Jefferies& Company: Great. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill [Naserlind].Please go ahead, sir. Your line is open. 
Bill Naserlind: My apologies. That was a mute faux pas. Relative to thesolid state drive business that you announced here recently, would you pleasediscuss what you view to be your opportunities in that market and the hurdlesthat are specific to Micron being successful in that market?
Steven R. Appleton: Sure. I’m going to generalize here, Bill, but we see twoprimary opportunities for us. One would be in the server space and the keyparameters there for our success are going to be performance and frankly justtime. It’s going to take some time for our end customers in that space to --servers and storage, basically, but it’s going to take time for our customersto understand the technology and ultimately integrate it into their systems tosupplement the hard disk drives and in some cases, even replace hard diskdrives. So it’s primarily time.  And the big motivator there for solid state drivepenetration is primarily performance advantages relative to the currentsolution.  The other end of the spectrum is going to be in the notebookcomputer area and of course, the primary advantage there, there are a varietyof advantages there but it’s performance, power consumption, weight,reliability and durability. And the primary inhibitor there, if you will, isgoing to be cost per gigabyte of storage. And as we move through 50-nanometerand 35-nanometer, we are addressing that challenge as well.  Either of those markets realistically, we’re looking at theend of next year or 2009 before either of them become real significant in termsof revenue drivers for us. 
Bill Naserlind: With the decline in NAND pricing that we’ve experienced,what is the premium that’s still in place, relative to a traditional hard diskdrive?
Michael W. Sadler: I’m sorry, the selling price premium today?
Bill Naserlind: Yes. 
Michael W. Sadler: That’s a good question. If I’m not mistaken -- I’m not anexpert on hard disk drives, by the way, but I believe they are selling forabout $1 a gigabyte, ballpark. And I think solid state drives are probablytoday selling for about $5 to $6 per gigabyte. So it’s a pretty significant premiumtoday.  And if that $1 per gigabyte is a magical figure, it’s goingto take us quite a while before we can get our costs down to be able toparticipate at that price level. But in any rate, there is still a hugedifferential in terms of the retail selling price of a solid state drive versusa traditional hard drive. 
Bill Naserlind: Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung. 
Glen Yeung -Citigroup: Thanks. I understand that you have this strategy of movingproduction 200-millimeter for specialty and for image sensors, but to whatextent is decommissioning some of your 200-millimeter fabs part of your near tomedium term strategy?
Steven R. Appleton: Decommissioning is a relative term. Remember that there isalso a process that we go through where we might convert, so when we saydecommission, it could be a conversion or it could be a shut-down, depending onthe scenario. A good example would be in Singapore right now, we’re actuallyconverting from 200 to 300 and it’s going pretty well.  The facilities that we have that are still running200-millimeter, which are primarily Japan and Italy, which Italy is dominatedby imaging and then some in Boise, right now we are using all that capacity. Sothe question is when do you think -- and we’re not using that capacity foranything significant on the core memory piece. All of our core memory in theNAND is all written on 300-millimeter and we think is good technology andpretty cost-effective.  So for us, it might be a slightly different scenario. Wehave heard reports and we’ve read reports out there in the industry where thereare several companies who have been running core DRAM on 200-millimeter andthey are talking about shutting that down here in the next 30 to 90 days. And Iwould expect that to continue for those operations where they do run corememory on 200-millimeter.  For us, it’s a little different scenario. I think the moreimportant issue for us is trying to understand the demand profile for thespecialty memory over a longer period of time, because obviously it has longlegs on it. And I don’t think, by the way, that you are talking about anythingin the next year for us. I think you are talking about something further out asto we either have to convert it or we will obviously take it offline. But rightnow, it’s all being consumed with non-core memory. 
Glen Yeung -Citigroup: I don’t know if you can comment on this or not, but you didmention that you think some of your competitors may be taking 200-millimeteroffline. What’s your sense as to the impact of that on the supply/demandbalance in ’08? Can it meaningfully help us? Is there enough there that it canhelp us out?
Steven R. Appleton: That’s hard for me to know. My instincts tell me it’s notthat much. I think it’s worth noting that if you look at the waferdifferential, or if you look at how the wafers break out today in silicon, notin bits, but if you look at it in silicon, about 75% of the worldwide DRAMmarket is made on 300-millimeter today and about 25% is made on 200-millimeter,so it’s still a significant amount of capacity in silicon.  But if you actually broke that down to bits, it wouldprobably be something more like 85-15, and when you look at what’s happeningaround the world on 300-millimeter and some of the expansion that’s alreadybeen mentioned, I think primarily the greatest impact will just be a pull backon 300-millimeter expansion as opposed to taking some of this more obsolete200-millimeter offline. 
Glen Yeung -Citigroup: And then Mike, you made a point that you thought DRAM demandin the first quarter was going to be above seasonal and you also suggested thatthe content per box wouldn’t meaningfully improve until there was stabilizationin price, and suggesting that either you either believe PC demand is going tobe better or you think that content is going to higher, i.e. price willstabilize. Any thoughts as to which you are really pointing to?
Michael W. Sadler: Just to clarify, we’re still -- we’ve seen continued contentgrowth through 2007 and we’re expecting to see content growth grow through 2008as more applications come to the PC and we get more Vista uptake and so forth.  My comment was that we didn’t get a big demand priceelasticity kicker that you would have expected with an 85% price decline overthe course of the year. I think that’s primarily because the customers areaware that the current market price for DRAM is probably not going to be atthat low a range for some time into the future, so they can’t really predictit.  We would expect to see strong PC unit growth next year,again in the range of 12% to 15%, and continued content growth but I do believeonce prices become a little bit more predictable from the customer’sstandpoint, they are going to feel comfortable about really cranking up DRAMcontent more significantly than they have in the past year. 
Glen Yeung -Citigroup: What is your sense as to where inventories are today, eitherat OEMs or the -- and the module makers? What’s your sense as to where westand?
Michael W. Sadler: Sure. On the OEM side, I don’t believe, at least with thecustomers we are working with, there’s virtually no inventory and there’d be nomotivation for them to take on any inventory because we do such a good job ofservicing their needs by storing product at their factory.  From an OEM standpoint, of course I can only speak to ourown inventories. On the DRAM side, we’ve got about three to four weeks worth ofsales in our own warehouses and our own customer hub. And in terms of thechannel inventory, I really don’t have tremendous visibility there, although wecontinue to move bits and pieces of our output into the channel every day.  So my perception would be there is probably not too muchinventory in the channel either. 
Glen Yeung -Citigroup: Okay, last question then is we’ve now just this pastnegotiation seen the contract price get down to about the level where spotprices are and we’ve seen spot pricing the last couple of weeks not look asvolatile as it has been. What’s your sense here as to whether or not we may beat least seeing a stemming of the decline that we’ve seen over the course ofthe last really 12 months?
Michael W. Sadler: Boy, that’s really tough to predict. I think, as youmentioned, we’ve seen -- we did see prices decline, our contract prices declinemid-December slightly, so that the rate of decline has slowed but we aregetting so low here that you would naturally expect that anyway. It’s reallydifficult for me to predict what’s going to happen over the course of the nextcouple of months with respect to pricing but it does feel like things might beslowing down, at least in terms of the rate of decline. 
Glen Yeung -Citigroup: Thanks. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman. 
Doug Freedman -American Technology Research: Steve, if you could temporarily put on your CFO hat for me,you made a comment in your preamble about operating cash flow for next year.Can you offer some guidance on what you are looking for for depreciation, anupdate there? And just trying to do some calculations on how you get to youroperating cash flow expectations. Is there -- 
Steven R. Appleton: Depreciation we expect to be around $2.2 billion. 
Doug Freedman -American Technology Research: And is there any -- you know, there’s been some talk aboutturning off some of your 200 tools or transitioning. Is there some cash thatyou are expecting to receive from 200-mil tools? 
Steven R. Appleton: Actually, we have both -- because of some technology we cameup in the testing arena, and because we have ongoing equipment sale from200-millimeter that is or isn’t being used or had been pulled out. And everyquarter we have typically a gain from the sale of some of that equipment. Andlast quarter I think it was probably in the neighborhood of something like $15million. I think that’s just kind of a continuum.  Now, the one caveat that I’ll say to that is in the eventthat we decide to take a facility and sell the 200-millimeter tools in it, it turnsout that the demand for 200-millimeter tools right now in the world is reallypretty strong, especially for the alignments that we have, which are consideredpretty advanced for 200-millimeter.  So we could easily generate quite a bit of cash from selling200-millimeter tools if we chose to do that. 
Doug Freedman -American Technology Research: All right, great. Could you spend a little time talkingabout the early adoption of SSDs and what that’s going to do? I was at theevent where you launched the products and most of them I believe were SLC basedproducts. My understanding is your output of SLC right now is very low. Is thatsomething that with the adoption of these drives, we’re going to see that mixstart shifting again? And if you could offer a little commentary onprofitability between the difference of MLC and SLC. 
Michael W. Sadler: Sure. I’ll try and address that. First of all, with respectto the high volume notebook market, we believe that ultimately it’s going to beMLC technology which really drives a significant penetration in the notebookmarket, primarily because of the pricing demands, or the cost sensitivity ofthat market. And we are planning to introduce, I don’t have the roadmap at myfingertips but we are planning to introduce MLC based drives fairly early inour ramp here as we move through next year and into 2009.  With respect to the SLC mix in our product portfolio, ourearly penetration in solid state drives is going to be 100% SLC, so to theextent that we are able to drive some meaningful volumes heading out of nextyear into 2009, yes, it would be reasonable to expect that for that applicationalone, our mix of SLC products would increase somewhat.  It’s probably also worth noting that there are a variety ofother applications. None of them as significant as solid state drives but thereare a variety of other applications that require SLC performance, which we arecurrently supporting right now from our existing output.  In terms of margins, I don’t have the specifics at myfingertips but certainly our margins on SLC today are quite a bit higher thanthey are on MLC and again, that’s primarily because the applications aresomewhat niche in nature and require that increased performance from SLC. 
Doug Freedman -American Technology Research: All right, terrific. Just two more real quick ones; waferstarts, what are we running as far as equivalents right now and what’s theforecast going forward? How much of the bit growth is coming from new starts?
Steven R. Appleton: Doug, we’re running [inaudible] in terms of outs for us, ofcourse; in 200-millimeter equivalents, we were up this quarter pretty nicely.In Q4, we ran around mid 90,000 outs a week and we are running 108,000, 109,000outs a week for fiscal Q1. And that will grow a percent or so in fiscal Q2. 
Doug Freedman -American Technology Research: Okay, and then my last one for you guys, any idea what youare looking at -- I mean, we’ve seen some pretty rough road here as far aspricing is concerned. But some of it’s been driven by pretty good bit costreductions by the leaders in the industry. What are you looking at as far asnext year as far as what potential do we have with the roadmaps that you haveto reduce the costs going forward on both DDR and the MLC product lines?
Steven R. Appleton: Well, we actually think we probably have more runway aheadof us than some others, but we are coming from a position in particular on NANDwhere we’ve been ramping and gaining scale and getting yield to where we thinkthat it’s advantageous for us. So on that front, we’ve been doing pretty well.  On the DRAM front, we’ve said I think for some time now wethink our technology has resulted in the smallest die in the industry by virtueof we really are in really high volume production on 78-nanometer today andwe’ve had [a success for a] long, long time. If you look at the data, it’spretty good for us. So we don’t see any reason we won’t continue to drivepretty strong cost reductions throughout ’08.  Now, I think part of your question was also along boy, thisindustry looks pretty tough right now and what do you think people are doing. Ithink we can improve our results for the things that we can control movingforward and we are starting to demonstrate that on the operating expense lineas well.  However, I do get this sense that the industry is difficultenough right now such that some of the players are starting to look at balancesheet preservation as opposed to any real expansion and we just have to see howthat plays out over the next quarter or two, because it’s -- you know, it is apretty difficult environment. 
Doug Freedman -American Technology Research: All right, great and good luck, guys. Thanks so much for thetime. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Van Hees.
Betsy Van Hees -Cowen & Company: Thanks for taking my call. I had a couple of questions.First, going back to the image sensor business, if I heard correctly, youmentioned that you were not immune to pricing in 1.3 megapixel and VGA beingaggressive. I was wondering if you could give us an idea of what type of pricedeclines that you saw. 
Michael W. Sadler: In aggregate, our pricing quarter over quarter was flat. Imean, it might have been up or down maybe half a percent, or something likethat. So in aggregate, it was flat and that was primarily a result of uscontinuing to climb up the pixel density curve somewhat.  I don’t have the specifics by chip in terms of what ouraverage selling price did, but in general it was flat quarter over quarter andreasonable to expect that would probably be the case for the current quarter aswell. 
Betsy Van Hees -Cowen & Company: Okay, great. Thank you. And then I had a question on yourmix for SLC versus MLC NAND for the quarter. 
Michael W. Sadler: The vast majority is MLC. Kipp, have you got that?
Kipp A. Bedard: I think we’re -- last time I looked, we run about 80-20. 
Michael W. Sadler: So ballpark, 80-20, 80 MLC, 20 SLC. 
Betsy Van Hees -Cowen & Company: And do you have any plans of maybe increasing your SLC,given the better mix, margins that you are getting in that and your launch ofsolid state storage drives?
Michael W. Sadler: In the very near term, our mix of MLC versus SLC is going toshift even stronger in favor of MLC. As the solid state drive initiative getssome traction, as I mentioned earlier, it would be logical to assume that we’llbe ramping up SLC again but again, from a meaningful shipment standpoint, wedon't expect that 2008 is going to be very significant in terms of SSD uptake.  
Betsy Van Hees -Cowen & Company: Okay, great. Thank you very much.  
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Berenbaum.
Daniel Berenbaum -Caris & Company: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. If we can go backto the cash flow from operations guidance real quick, the $1.5 billion to $2billion for fiscal ’08, you talked about where depreciation and amortizationwould be going. Could you give us some insight into what other variables youput into that equation? I’m sure you have some -- you’ve made some fairly toughassumptions to come out with that number. Can you help us understand what someof your assumptions are to get to those numbers?
Steven R. Appleton: Well, maybe Kipp can comment on it more, if he knows whatyou are really trying to get at, which I suspect is probably just priceforecasting. Clearly -- 
Daniel Berenbaum -Caris & Company: Not just price forecasting, but just -- I mean, maybe giveus some insight into where you see your revenue trends and what goes into thatand then what trends you are seeing on the cost side as well? I mean, you werefairly specific about the guidance, so I am just trying to understand how youthink about those numbers. 
Steven R. Appleton: Well, let me give you some of my thoughts and then Kipp canadd where he wants to. We are clearly in a growth phase for the company and ifyou look at the data, we -- most quarters, you know, we’ve had some flatperiods because of significant price declines but we have been ramping ourcapability and you saw the growth that we had this quarter and we had growthfrom the last quarter prior to that. We obviously are adding more output andwhether or not that results in greater revenues or less revenues, your guess isas good as mine on what the selling price is going to do.  But having said that, we have in our forecast, of course,something that we can’t share but we obviously have a continuing trend of ASPdeclines in the market built into our model for obvious reasons. We are tryingto be conservative and making sure that we understand the financials as we movethroughout the year in an environment that’s not favorable for us, althoughfrankly we have no idea whether that is going to be the case or not.  So we have that built in and even with that built in, thosewere the cash flow -- the cash flow range that I gave you is with thatconservancy built in.  Kipp, do you have anything else you want to add to that?
Kipp A. Bedard: Not much to add to that, Steve. Are there anymore questions?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra.
Tristan Gerra -Robert W. Baird & Company: You mentioned on the call that at 68-nanometer, you haveabout a 25% die size reduction versus 78-nanometer. We know Samsung at66-nanometers, a little bit behind; Hynix is doing well. How do you compare interms of die size at 68-nanometer relative to the competition currently?
Steven R. Appleton: Well, we compare pretty favorable. Obviously we have been at6F-squared and we’ve been able to optimize that for our process. I don’t knowif Kipp, you want to add anything to that. 
Kipp A. Bedard: More specifically, I think we have shown some slides, orMark Duran has, we’re looking at 20% to 25% die size advantage over competitorsright now, partly due to where we are in process migration and partly due tothe 6F-squared technology that we’ve had matured up now for several years. 
Tristan Gerra -Robert W. Baird & Company: Okay, and then just a quick follow-up in terms of mix inimaging. If you could give us some color on the mix of VGA versus 1.3-,2-megapixel. 
Michael W. Sadler: Sure. In the quarter we are reporting on now, so in ourfiscal Q1, just over half of our unit shipments were 2-megapixel and above, soby definition just under half were at 1-megapixel and below. And I would expectthat’s going to -- we’re going to continue to increase the higher density, thehigher pixel density units as a percentage of the overall going forward, so itwill be up slightly from that in the current quarter. 
Tristan Gerra -Robert W. Baird & Company: Okay, so you wouldn’t expect VGA to pick up as a percentageof revenue some time next year or this year, this fiscal year?
Michael W. Sadler: I don’t want to look too far into the future, but in thecurrent quarter I think it’s a pretty safe assumption that that would not bethe case, so it will be a richer mix of 2-megapixel and above in the currentquarter as well. 
Tristan Gerra -Robert W. Baird & Company: Great. Thank you. 
Kipp A. Bedard: Thanks, Tristan and with that, we’d like to thank everyonefor participating on the call today.

Bill Stover: Thanks, Kipp. For those listeners may not yet have access to our press release, let me go over a summary of financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year which ended August 30. For the fourth quarter net sales totaled $1.44 billion, that is an 11% increase over the preceding quarter, and the company recorded a net loss of $158 million or $0.21 per diluted share. In spite of 15% declines in quarter over quarter DRAM and NAND pricing, the company achieved a 4 percentage point improvement in overall gross margins, largely as a result of the cost reductions being realized on NAND Flash memory. We're very pleased with our NAND progress and note that NAND Flash realized a positive gross margin in the fourth quarter. For the fiscal year, net sales totaled $5.7 billion, and the company recorded a net loss of $320 million, or $0.42 per diluted share. Gross margin for the year came in at 19%, reflective of the ASP environment and for the bulk of the year the early stage of ramp of NAND devices. DRAM gross margins improved several percentage points comparing 2007 to 2006. Our cost reduction efforts in SG&A and in research and development are beginning to be reflected in a lower cost structure. We expect the quarterly run rate in 2008 for SG&A to be between $125 million and $135 million. SG&A in the fourth quarter of 2007 reflected a higher level of legal expenses in preparation for several upcoming trials. Stock-related non-cash expenses totaled $44 million in 2007, of which approximately $21 million are reflected in SG&A. A strategic move to partner for NAND development has been noticeably beneficial in containing R&D expense. We expect R&D to run between $165 million and $175 million per quarter for 2008. Our forecast for capital spending in 2008 is $2.5 billion, with the vast majority of the dollars being spent on 300 mm wafer fab tooling in support of NAND and DRAM processing. Approximately $750 million of that '08 capital spending is expected to come from partner contribution. The growth across the balance sheet is reflective of the expansion of operations at our IM Flash ventures and TECH Semiconductor. The company is well positioned with $2.6 billion of cash and investments. I will close there and turn the commentary over to Mike.
Mike Sadler:  With solid demand for computers, mobile phones and a variety of consumer electronics products, we had strong quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in excess of 10%. Contributing to the top line growth were a 20% plus NAND Flash trade ASP increase and as referenced in the press release, strong sequential growth in NAND and DRAM production and shipments. Our capacity and R&D investments are resulting in further output growth, and we are in the mode of taking share in the memory market. As we layer in additional capacity and technology advancements, we will be in this mode for the foreseeable future.  Much of the output growth is attributed to productivity increases. In fiscal Q4 we again reduced costs at a faster pace than market prices declined. Due to industry wide oversupply in the memory markets however, the absolute price levels have been under pressure. Market demand for computing products continues to be robust amidst typical seasonal demand strength heading out of calendar Q3 and into calendar Q4.  We have seen a moderate flattening in memory content per system growth from the PC OEMs in calendar Q3. I attribute this primarily to concerns from our customers that memory prices were increasing early in the summer. As a consequence, OEMs took steps to maintain reasonable control of system build and material costs, and used memory content as a lever to achieve that. End customers then turned to third-party module makers and spot players to fill memory needs, resulting in extraordinary amount of buying and selling activity in the spot markets. With memory market prices coming back down in late summer, our OEM customers are adopting a more aggressive posture towards system memory content. On the DRAM product front, we continue to bolster the product portfolio with new offerings in the low power and low voltage arenas, as well as new high-density and high-performance DRAM products. These products, including a newly introduced memory interface known as DDR 3, are aimed at increasing Micron's exposure to the network and communications infrastructure, mobile phone, automotive, server and PC gaming market segments. We have internal infrastructure to support customers in these segments, and it is only natural for us to strengthen the portfolio so we can bring more value to customers in these spaces. Our 78 nanometer 1 gigabit DDR2 chip continues to be the high-volume product for the desktop and notebook market segments. This device has reached yield maturity at our 300 mm fab in Virginia, and we are commencing the production ramp of the same chip on 300 mm wafers in our Singapore facility. Much of our output growth in fiscal year '08 is coming from the 300 mm production ramp in Singapore, and as a result we expect further improvements in the DRAM cost per bit profile. In the NAND Flash arena, the vast majority of our IMFD production output today is centered on our 8 gigabit device running on a 72 nanometer process on 300 mm wafers in Virginia. This device is being marketed to a variety of consumer electronics and memory card providers, and is in fact used to populate our own branded Lexar Flash cards and drives. We're in the early stages of volume production of the 50 nanometer 16 gigabit MLC device in Virginia. For the same die size we get twice as many bits relative to the 72 nanometer version, resulting in a substantial manufacturing cost reduction. On the heels of the Virginia 50 nanometer transition is the initial production ramp of the new 300 mm facility in Lehi, Utah. With these leaps in scale and technology deployment we couldn't be happier about our improvements in competitiveness, as evidenced by the 40% fixed sequential cost per bit reduction in fiscal Q4. Going forward, we are well-equipped to be a leader in the high volume, high density MLC markets. We continue with development and production of a variety of SLC devices at the Boise fab for high-performance requirements in computing, automotive, communications and other specialty markets. Among those specialty opportunities today is the solid-state drive market. We are rolling out a family of SATA interface solid-state drives later this year. This is a logical extension to our existing portfolio as the targeted customer base and channels are already in existence here at Micron. There are compelling advantages associated with solid-state storage, such as performance, ruggedness and power conservation. As we continue to implement cost reductions through both scale and technology advancements, solid-state drives will reach mass market penetration and become a tremendous driver of demand for NAND Flash devices. The mobile phone market is growing nicely in 2007, and from a market segment standpoint, continues to be the primary driver of demand for our CMOS Image Sensors. As I have mentioned in past calls, we pride ourselves on having the highest performance pixels in the industry. As a result, we are taking share in the high end of the market. This was evidenced in fiscal Q4 with the quarter-over-quarter increase in imaging revenues despite a moderate unit shipment decrease. We have worked diligently at establishing a balanced customer base in the mobile phones space for our image sensors. The results are encouraging as the revenue pipeline is loaded with design wins at multiple customers. Beyond the mobile phone market, our 8 megapixel sensors are now featured in a variety of digital still cameras that are now available to consumers. This is a space formally locked up with CCD technology, and we believe today's CMOS digital still cameras are just the tip of the iceberg in terms of further CMOS market penetration. We are at the forefront of this effort. Without question, the market environment is challenging, and this is attributed to in the industry as why supply growth that is outstripping demand. With recently announced cutbacks in capital spending and anecdotal input from capital equipment providers, this cycle will be self-correcting, just as has been the case in the past. Fundamentally demand is quite strong for our products. Customers like our product portfolio and roadmap and we're becoming much more cost-efficient in manufacturing these products. With that I will turn it back to Kipp for our Q&A.
 Kipp Bedard:  We would now like to take questions from callers. Just a reminder, if you are using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset when asking a question so we can hear you clearly. With that we would like to open up the phone lines.
Operator: Your first question comes from John Pitzer - Credit Suisse.
 John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: If both DRAM and NAND pricing were flat from current levels, what would you expect them to be for the full first quarter? 
Mike Sadler: If pricing were flat for the balance of the quarter and the mix were relatively representative of what we already shipped for the first four weeks of the quarter, DRAM pricing would be down about 10% and NAND Flash trade pricing, which is essentially our selling price of Micron branded products to market, would be down about 25%.
 John Pitzer - Credit Suisse:  Mike, you talked about bits per box slowing here in the calendar third quarter. What is the expectation going forward? Do you think price elasticity will kick back in and we will start to see configurations move up, or do you think PC OEMs are going to be pretty satisfied at these configs?
Mike Sadler:  I think we've got a couple of things working here. Number one, I think we are in fact seeing some benefit of price elasticity as the OEM customers are feeling more confident about the absolute price levels as well as the direction of DRAM pricing; feel comfortable about having a stronger memory content profile in their systems. Number 2, we've got the overriding effect of further penetration of Vista operating system, which tends to require more memory than its predecessors as well. So we feel pretty comfortable about the near term as well as the intermediate, the longer term about acceleration of memory content.
 John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: If you looked at the May quarter, at your segment reporting, the CMOS Image Sensor business actually lost money on an operating basis. I'm kind of curious if you were able to breakeven this quarter there or not?
Steve Appleton:  We will put that in the K, like we have done in past quarters. So if you will bear with us on that, we will get that updated for you here in the next week or two as we get that posted.
Operator: Your next question comes from Glen Yeung - Citigroup.
 Glen Yeung - Citigroup:  Can we just start with what your bit production was in Q3, and what you think it will be in Q4 for NAND and DRAM?
Bill Stover:  On a relative basis, the growth would be up low double-digits going forward on DRAM and up about 40% QoQ on the NAND side.
 Glen Yeung - Citigroup:  That is NAND into the foreseeable future, or is that just for the next quarter?
Bill Stover:  That will be an average going forward over the next three or four quarters.
 Glen Yeung - Citigroup:  Can you also look at the same thing just on a cost basis? You get a normal cost down each quarter. How do you think that might track over the next few quarters for each of NAND and DRAM?
Bill Stover:  DRAM I would say down high single-digits on a go-forward basis, and NAND probably down mid-teens.
 Glen Yeung - Citigroup: Given the pricing environment that we're in, what your sense as to what happens to all the 200 mm capacity that you and the industry have, and whether or not you think that is something may come offline a little more quickly than it might otherwise happen?
Bill Stover:  On the 200 mm side we've got a number of different dynamics going on. First of all, we have options to move the capacity around in to a couple of places where we think are more productive than potentially the DRAM that it is allocated to at the moment. We have transitions going from some of the DRAM capacity into 15 nanometer NAND. Also as Mike alluded to, we have pretty strong performance on the design wins side in imaging right now, so we anticipate that there will be some transition of DRAM wafers into imaging going forward.
 Glen Yeung - Citigroup:  Is that at any different rate than might normally happened?
Mike Sadler:  What do you mean by that?
 Glen Yeung - Citigroup:  Are you accelerating the movement from DRAM to Image Sensor, given the fact that DRAM pricing is down so much?
Mike Sadler:  I don't think that is the driving factor. The other thing to keep in mind is we don't have that much advanced DRAM running on 200 mm. Most of that stuff is what you would think of as legacy, which is either the synchronous or the pseudo static, et cetera. In fact I think all of our really advanced stuff, the 50 nanometer and the 78 nanometer is all running on 300 mm at Virginia and Utah and Singapore is in the conversion right now to 300 mm. They are part way through it. When you say are we accelerating, there's not a lot left actually.  The Imaging business though, as you know, has been down and what we are seeing is that should start to grow again. Obviously it grew this quarter, and it should grow again from here as we move forward. If that happens, yes, we will convert more of it over it to it.
 Glen Yeung - Citigroup: I heard the comment that overall PC demand looks pretty solid. I really want to get a sense from you, if you could just provide more color on how you see fourth quarter PC component outlook shaping up?
Bill Stover:  We have to translate that to memory demand, of course, because that is our area of expertise. If I take a cross-section of our customers, calendar Q4 versus calendar Q3 in the PC space we're looking at a low of 5% sequential growth in bit consumption and a high of 20% growth in sequential bit consumption, and kind of a weighted average as being close to mid-teens, 15% or something like that, which is typical seasonal. It is nothing extraordinary, but I think typical seasonal.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs.
 Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: On the DRAM supply, can you give us some kind of estimate of either how much you think DRAM CapEx needs to come down to fix the excess supply situation and/or when that might occur? My follow-up would just be on the solid-state drives for NAND, do you have any forecast for 2008 of what you might expect for some unit penetration on the notebook side, as some kind of example? Thanks so much.
 Kipp Bedard:  I will take the first one in terms of CapEx coming down. As you know, it is always a combination of supply and demand that has its impact on pricing and so you are really asking us to do both. I think with your background in capital equipment you have got a pretty good handle on how that is starting to shape up for '08. It is way too early for us to try and estimate what bit growth is going to be in '08 from the demand side.  So I'm going to defer that one for awhile. I think Mike is getting ready to handle the SSD question.
Mike Sadler:  I can't reference penetration percentage, but our expectations in 2008 are that the demand for solid-state drives will be somewhere between 5 M and 10 million units. The memory, the storage that that represents in terms of the percentage of the NAND market, it is still in single-digits; probably 3%, 4%, 5% of the total market in 2008. We do believe that within three or four years -- say by 2011 -- we think that the demand for solid-state drives will be upwards of 50 million units per year, probably closer to 60 million units per year and that the number of bits consumed in those drives will be somewhere in the neighborhood of 20% to 25% of the total NAND market. That is why we're so bullish on this particular application segment.
Operator: Your next question comes from Shawn Webster - JP Morgan.
 Shawn Webster - JP Morgan:  Can I circle back up to your fiscal Q4 DRAM production and NAND production? I didn't catch that.
Bill Stover: Sure. We actually ran over 20% NAND core DRAM bit production quarter to quarter, and we were well over our 50% that we guided to in the prior quarter on NAND.
 Shawn Webster - JP Morgan:  I'm sorry, the 20% number, that is DRAM production?
Bill Stover:  That's correct. Core DRAM production.
 Shawn Webster - JP Morgan:  Total DRAM up around 20% and then NAND, 50% to 60%?
Bill Stover:  DRAM was up over 20% and NAND was up over 50%. We're not going to give specifics, but we're up in both categories above that guidance.
 Shawn Webster - JP Morgan: What are you seeing in terms of DRAM channel inventory now?
Mike Sadler:  I don't have good visibility into the channel inventory. I can tell you of course our own inventory is in the neighborhood of four weeks, somewhere around the neighborhood of four weeks of supply, plus or minus depending on the particular technology, which is about where we would like to be.
 Shawn Webster - JP Morgan: Did you throw out what you guys saw in terms of your bit per box or an estimate of what your customers are loading for DRAM consumption?
Bill Stover:  I can refer you to the slide deck. We did show that number.
 Shawn Webster - JP Morgan:  It is in the slides?
Bill Stover:  Yes.
 Shawn Webster - JP Morgan:  Is there any update that you can give us, you guys have been speaking before on the desire to restructure or sell off your sensor business, is there any update there for us?
Bill Stover:  We haven't really been that specific because we're still exploring the alternatives. I think the way to characterize it is similar to what I have characterized it in the past, which is we have every intent to continue to manufacture the product at the silicon level. It is really what we're exploring is our business model of will this product makes its way to market; in which case, should we do a partnership of some type where we break that out? It is a little bit of a different characterization than selling off our Imaging business, because we intend to continue to manufacture it. It is really a piece of it that is modeling. Nothing is going to happen this quarter, but we will keep you updated as we move into the next quarter.
 Shawn Webster - JP Morgan: It seemed like a small inventory write-down. Was most of that DRAM or what was the composition of that?
Bill Stover:  We identified that that is both DRAM and NAND. Greater than 50% of it, the majority of it was on the DRAM side, a little bit on the NAND side, and not on the Imaging side.
 Shawn Webster - JP Morgan: That is just mark-to-market stuff?
Bill Stover: You got it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Doug Freedman - Am Tech Research.
 Doug Freedman - Am Tech Research:  Just to start with, any guidance on what you think depreciation for '08 is going to look like?
Bill Stover:  It will run between $500 million and $540 million, increasing over the year. Use $2.2 billion for your '08 estimate.
 Doug Freedman - Am Tech Research:  So no change there. Then you commented that you are in a position to be taking share. Can you discuss if we are looking at, in the past you have been trying to steer some of your share more towards the specialty market. Any progress that you are having there and any discussions you can have as far as where you're targeting your share gains from?
Bill Stover:  Sure. Our objective is to take as much share as we possibly can in what you would characterize as the specialty markets. Specifically we would refer to those as the server market, the mobile phone market, the networking and communications infrastructure market, automotive, medical, industrial and consumer. For us the desktop and notebook market primarily drives asset utilization. That is our share is lowest, I think, in all those market segments that I preferred to.  With respect to us growing share, our objective would be to place as many bits as we possibly can in the premium or the specialty markets, and then utilize the notebook and the desktop markets to drive the asset utilization for us. In the next fiscal year we're probably looking at becoming more significant in the notebook and the desktop area relative to where we have been in the last year, and continuing to do the best job we can in those other market segments.
 Doug Freedman - Am Tech Research:  Can you talk a little bit about what is going on with NAND in the retail channel with your Lexar brand, and what your outlook there is, how that business is running, any update you can offer?
Mike Sadler:  First of all, let me may be characterize the Lexar operation I think with respect to where it was a year ago. I think despite a contradiction to what maybe some people have said in the media, we actually like Lexar. It has done very well. Remember the first objective for the year was to get it focused, cleaned up and back to a level where it wasn't losing the kind of money it was when we acquired it. That has been accomplished. As we look forward to the market, I think we have a greater presence actually in some channels and maybe less of a presence in other channels by virtue of us targeting the bits into what we think are better opportunities for us. So it has actually gone pretty well. I think now we're looking at trying to retake market share in the retail channel, but in addition to that continuing to use more and more of our own output. Remember that a year ago when we acquired them, we didn't really have any spare NAND. Most of it was already committed to a customer base and as we have grown our output, we have been able to more and more allocate into that model and obviously leverage that entire relationship. So I think you'll see a growing presence over the next year in that channel.
Bill Stover:  Just to add to that. In our last fiscal quarter roughly 10% of our own silicon output went through the Lexar channel, and that is going to expand to about 15% in the current quarter. As we move forward the slope of our output ramp on NAND Flash is very significant and we're going to be putting more and more of that output through the Lexar channel.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers.
 Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers:  Could you give us some sense as to clarify what you said on cost reduction going forward the expectation on the NAND side? And maybe any expectation of timelines that you may be looking at to breakeven and gross margins move more constructively in the NAND arena?
 Kipp Bedard: We had been guiding previously at around 20% sequential cost reductions on NAND. Basically we have been giving you a three to four quarter rolling forecast. As you have seen from the last couple of periods, we have come down significantly better than that. Our reference in the press release, for example, over 40% in the fourth fiscal quarter. So our next update for you is we think we will bring cost down sequentially for the next three to four quarters in the mid-teens range on NAND. When that crosses over in the future is really a combination again, as I mentioned to Jim, of price and cost reductions. So I will let you model the ASP reductions along with these sequential mid-teen kind of reductions. There will be quarters where it is substantially higher than that by the way just like you have seen in the last couple quarters, but that is a good average for the next four quarters you are trying to model your year.
Bill Stover:  In our opening finance comments, we acknowledged that NAND Flash had a positive gross margin for the fourth quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird.
 Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird : What percentage of your total NAND Flash output could Lexar use next year? How do you capitalize on some of the IP you have acquired with Lexar?
Bill Stover:  Let me start with the IP piece first. We obviously think that it has been of greater value to us. Clearly we did announce the Toshiba settlement historically. Of course it continues to be part of our portfolio. So we have a very, very strong portfolio in this arena. We believe that is in part why we have been so strong in this arena and we haven't really been in litigation on the NAND front. I will just leave it at that. We think that part has been very valuable. Obviously, it is hard to quantify in many ways. But we're pretty happy with it.  Mike, do you want to get the other? 
Mike Sadler: Sure. I can't be too specific on the percentage of our output that we will move through Lexar. I think it is worth mentioning that Lexar has favorable supply agreements with some other players from the NAND Flash supply-side, and we want to use that to complement our own silicon going forward. It is safe to say that the percentage of our output going through Lexar will increase quarter over quarter for the next several quarters. But I don't have a particular target in mind with respect to a percentage of our overall output that we want to move through Lexar. Again, we want to take advantage of the favorable supply agreements that were in place when we acquired the company, and use those to complement our own flash output.
 Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird : The market share gains that you're mentioning I am assuming have to do with a cost advantage that you currently have. If you could talk about this, and how long do you think you can extend that potential advantage?
Mike Sadler:  It has primarily to do with the bit growth, but I think you're right, it all comes back to a technology advantage that is giving us a strong quarter over quarter bit growth. The completion of the ramp which we are now substantially through, and the transition of the facility from 200 mm to 300 mm.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Lau - Jefferies & Co.
 John Lau - Jefferies:  I want to circle back on the CMOS sensors and give us another update again on the CMOS sensors. Have you seen NAND start to pick up again for cell phones and digital cameras? I'm missed that. I apologize.
 Kipp Bedard:  We are seeing some pretty strong acceleration in the current quarter on I will say unforecasted business, particularly on the low end. Low end for us in the Sensor area would be in the VGA and 1 megapixel area. I call it spot business. It is business that we hadn't forecasted. I'm not sure if I could attribute it to a recovery by one particular customer or seasonal demand increasing significantly but we are seeing some pretty good positive movements in the current quarter, particularly in the low end, that are unforecasted.
 John Lau - Jefferies:  But nothing significant in the higher 3 or 4 megapixel? Did you mention anything about the higher than 4 megapixel in the digital camera arena?
 Kipp Bedard:  We have a series of design wins with our 8 megapixel sensor in the stand-alone DSC market that actually sales are doing quite well there. But we have done a very good job of forecasting the demand there in terms of working with our customers. We put enough work in process in the pipeline essentially we don't have any shortages. I would suggest that is also the case in the high-end mobile phone area. On a 5 megapixel we have got a very high-profile design win with a 5 megapixel sensor and the same situation, we have done a pretty good job of assessing the demand situation and we don't have any shortages. So we're right on top of things there on the high end.
Operator: Your next question comes from Aaron Husock - Morgan Stanley.
 Aaron Husock - Morgan Stanley: Sticking with Imaging for a minute. I'm looking at the August quarter. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the like-for-like pricing environment? I'm assuming that like-for-like pricing was still down in the quarter, despite your blended ASPs being up a little bit more than 5%. Can you quantify that a little bit, and talk about if you see those like-for-like pricing environment changing at all this quarter?
Mike Sadler:  I don't have the data at my fingertips such that I can quantify that meaningfully, Aaron. But it is safe to say that other than the very new products, which would be the high-end probably 5 and 8 megapixel, certainly the pricing was down quarter over quarter for, as you call it, the like-for-like products.
 Aaron Husock - Morgan Stanley: Was it down as much as we have seen historically, or are you seeing any signs of stabilization in terms of like-for-like pricing, either in the August quarter or the current quarter?
Mike Sadler:  Nothing particularly alarming. Of course, if I compared it to the memory market on a relative basis, it didn't even move.
 Aaron Husock - Morgan Stanley:  Any plans to move to 300 mm on the Imaging side?
Mike Sadler:  I think that the answer first of all is yes. It is just a matter of when. I don't think it is if. It all has to do with timing on the economic model. We will be, I think, in a position within the next two years where we start pulling out 200 mm equipment out of the current fabs as it transitions to the next generation mode. The model that we have been running is utilizing that equipment to produce Imaging, because Imaging even today, by anybody, is still running on a one or two generation lagging process technology compared to DRAM or NAND. As a result, we of course can use that equipment and extend its life for quite some time. We could use it for memory at a very cost-effective way. So we will go to 300 mm as we start transitioning the current memory fabs away from some the equipment they have now, obviously in favor of more advanced process equipment. It is not if, it is just when. We don't really think that happens for probably two maybe three years. Let me just make a comment on that. Some companies are talking about doing that today, but the reality is you can't even use the advanced process on this type of product because it just doesn't utilize it. So you've got a pretty high cost for doing that. Until you can use the process node that is equivalent to a 300 mm equivalent, it doesn't make a lot of sense to do that. For us, that time period is really still a couple of years away.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank.
 Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank:  Just thinking a little more long term, is there any update on the Flash facility in Singapore? When do you expect that to be a contributor to your capacity?
Bill Stover:  We are running pretty much on schedule, slightly ahead of schedule actually, so we still anticipate first silicon starts in the second half of '08, and start contributing meaningfully in calendar 09.
 Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank: Just to help me size it, can we think of the capacity at IM Flash Singapore similar to Lehi, or is it a little bigger, a little smaller?
Bill Stover: Slightly bigger. Think of it in terms of 50,000 to 60,000 per month.
 Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank:  Can you talk a little bit about, you mentioned your SSD efforts, is it safe to assume you are doing some collaboration there? That segment seems to be getting a bit crowded and it seems pretty R&D intensive. Intel at their IDF announced a SSD offering, are you guys amortizing your R&D investment there a little bit?
Bill Stover:  Obviously we've had some own announcements around some SSD products we either just introduced or are walking towards. I would say there are a number of players out there on both sides of the fence. There is both the drive guys and there are the component guys. I think a number of us are trying to figure out if there is partnerships that will work in that space or not. We're just trying to work through it. That is all I can really say at this point. I certainly don't think we are alone in terms of others trying to look at what might be the best model in that market.
 Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank: Final question, you alluded to this, but it looks like your NAND cost reductions came in again really much better than expectations, above 40% versus expectation around 20%. How should we think of that? Is that MLC penetration, just higher MLCs rate or better yields or just more aggressive down to 50 nanometer? How is the best way to think about that?
Bill Stover:  I think the results from Q4 are primarily indicative of faster ramp and higher yields we had modeled in above the MLC penetration that we actually achieved. The technology ramps have been pretty strong. Going forward we will be more dependant on the 50 nanometer ramp, and that also is proceeding as per schedule.
 Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank:  Can you ballpark the MLC mix for me?
Bill Stover:  I would say it is in excess of 50%, actually it is probably closer to 75% for Micron, and Intel will have to speak for themselves.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns.
 Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns:  Do you have any view on industry-wide supply growth for NAND in 2008 as compared to '07?
Mike Sadler:  We have seen some reports. We have seen anything from probably 130% to 150% as it shapes up today with current CapEx announcements. We know that a lot of our competitors will update those CapEx projections in '08 over the next couple of months, and that will give all the experts out there trying to put these market expectations together a look at a new refreshed set. But right now we are seeing about 130% to 150%.
 Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns:  Now based on your estimates do you think the supply growth in '08 is equivalent to the supply growth we saw in '07?
Bill Stover:  It is coming in very similar to '07 if it hits that rate. There's a lot of movement now in CapEx, a lot of discussions, Mike referenced about some CapEx push outs, etc. We will just have to see how those all shape up here over the announcements over the next couple of months.
 Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns:  The second question is, given your NAND supply growth, which as you say this could be 40% on a quarterly basis, and given what we are seeing from others, is there any reason that in Q1 or the early part of '08 we will not see very significant price declines on the NAND side?
 Kipp Bedard :  It has always been our policy not to predict pricing, because as Mike mentioned, it is very difficult to do. So we will leave it to you experts to try to predict the supply/demand balance.
Operator: Your next question comes from Manish Goyal -CREF Investments.
 Manish Goyal -CREF Investments:  The question is on NAND again. Your gross margins are significantly below your large competitors. Roughly what scale do you need when your NAND cost structure will be comparable to the leading vendors and your gross margins are comparable? Can you size that, either in wafer starts or market share, what you need to be comparable?
 Kipp Bedard:  I have recently heard Mark speak about the fact that technologically now we believe we are on particularly with the largest NAND supplier today. We're probably a couple quarters behind catching the others. As we have mentioned in the past, we are in a significant ramp. I think Mark highlighted just a few minutes ago that this past quarter again, almost double the cost reductions we expected came from faster ramp in Lehi, mature yields, and the beginning move of 50. Going through the next year it is largely due to the 50 nanometer, the completion of Lehi and then as Mark mentioned, sometime the latter part of '08 into '09 a continuation of Singapore.
Mike Sadler:  Let me just add on to what Kipp just said. First of all, let me tell you, we think we're probably there in terms of the Virginia facility. We track this data pretty good. It is now optimized, or pretty closely to being optimized, and NAND production, obviously it is making DRAM as well. We think we are every bit as cost competitive there. It is just a reality that when you're in the middle of a ramp it is just not as cost competitive. Utah is in the middle of a ramp right now. Obviously as that gets ramped and optimized we think that will become the case as well. We actually think we have advantages in many ways in terms of our 50 nanometer and the die size and so forth. When you say that it is obvious that our gross margin in NAND are lower than our competitors, first of all we don't disclose gross margins in NAND, although Bill just told you that it was positive for us. But even having said that, in our particular scenario where we are under the ramp, we have to look at it facility by facility, and we think Virginia is right here.
 Manish Goyal -CREF Investments: So 12 months out towards the end of 2008, where do you think will be your either wafer starts from NAND or maybe your aspiration for market share in NAND?
Mike Sadler:  I probably won't go there in wafer starts unless someone else here has the data. But in terms of what we think happens on market share, the data is out there. I think the expectation obviously is that we will grow market share. I think most of the data today says we're in somewhere in the 5% to 7%. And I think by the time we get into '08, which would mean Utah will have been ramped, you'll probably see that double.
 Manish Goyal -CREF Investments:  Just a last question on DRAM. When you think about increasing DRAM content per PC, are you thinking more in terms of either 2 gig moving to 3 gig, or are you thinking that the boxes are going to 1 gig or 1.5 gig move to 2 gigs? The leading PC vendors, nobody is really advertising PCs with more than 2 gig of DRAM and I was just wondering how you were thinking about the increase in content?
Mike Sadler:  I think the biggest driver of the increase in content for the next couple of quarters is going to be the move of boxes from less than 2 gigabytes to 2 gigabytes. So in other words, the 1 to 1.5 gigabyte machines today moving to 2 gigabyte standard.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bill Buyton - CNL Capital.
 Bill Buyton - CNL Capital: What was the MLC mix the last quarter?
Bill Stover:  I don't have that right at my hands. It is in excess of 50%.
 Bill Buyton - CNL Capital: My second question is, would the ASP drop have a lot to do with more shift to MLC versus SLC during the quarter?
Bill Stover:  The ASPs for NAND are a little bit complicated because when we report them as dropping in the press release, we're blending in the NAND that we sell to our partner as something that approximates cost. So our trade ASPs are actually up and the blended is down.
Operator: Your final question comes from Bill Dezellem - Tieton Capital Management.
 Bill Dezellem - Tieton Capital Management: First of all, circling back to the Image Sensor market, you had mentioned that at some point in the future it may be cost effective for the industry to shift to 300 mm. But not thinking about cost, but thinking about the product quality, is there any improvement or opportunities for improving pixel density or anything interesting on that front that may take place when 300 mm is running Image Sensors?
Mike Sadler:  I don't think it is today. I think that that has to do with primarily advancing the process technology, and actually, Bill, you can advance the process technology from where Image Sensors are today equally as well on both 200 mm or 300 mm. That is where you'll primarily be able to get I think advantage; think of it as the qualitative measurement of the pixel performance and Image Sensor performance. There's nothing inherent at the moment that has 300 mm over 200 mm. But I do think eventually it will come down to a cost equation. As you advance the process technology itself, ultimately you won't be able to have 200 mm equipment if that won't do it, because the geometries will get below what really is out there in the mass market for the equipment.
 Bill Dezellem - Tieton Capital Management: Secondarily on an entirely different topic, the restructuring last quarter you announced that you would begin a restructuring process that, if we remember correctly, was going to take several quarters. Would you please discuss what it was that you did in the fourth quarter, and what you still see remaining to be done? How much of a benefit your existing actions have had, excluding the charge that you announced in the quarter. What would you anticipate future actions to benefit?
Bill Stover:  Of course, we aren't to try to quantify it in dollars for you, because we have stayed away from that in large part because it is unpredictable exactly how that shows up. But I think you should think in terms of two different categories, because we have to bifurcate it to some degree. We have benefits that will show up in the cost of goods sold and we will have benefits that will show up in the overhead expenses. I am going to not really speak too much about the cost of goods sold, because that gets mixed in to the things that we do in terms of output, yields, et cetera and in terms of trying to streamline what we have going on in the operations, and that will show up in the cost per bit. In terms of the operating expenses, we have been pretty focused on two pieces, which is the SG&A and the R&D. Clearly we believe, as I noted at the last analyst conference, that we have to get competitive on our total overhead, operating expenses to the benchmarks that are out there in the industry. If you look at the benchmarks in the industry, those in combination need to be somewhere between realistically 14% to 16% of revenues and it depends on whether the revenues are decreasing or increasing based on prices. So it moves around a little bit on you, but that is what needs to happen. There are really four parts to that. The simplest part is where you just have to simply not do things that maybe you were doing before that aren't as critical. In other words, get focused on how you are expending that money. But when it comes to personnel, there are really three things that happen there. There are position eliminations, which we have already spoken about to the media. There are things where we are trying to do outsourcing, which is in other words trying to change the business model, where someone might be more effective at than we are, more cost effective. Another piece is continuing to move some of what we do in the U.S. to our other operations that exist elsewhere in the world. Realistically the position eliminations have already taken place. We had a restructuring charge this quarter for in large part that. There may be a little bit of that that we carry forward, but probably not a lot. The rest of it is really round the outsourcing, or the moved to other operations around the world. It will take a couple of quarters for us to figure out what makes the most sense in terms of optimizing the model on outsourcing. Actually the move to other operations around the world will probably be something more along the lines of 12 to 18 months because as an example, we may have a particular package what we are doing in the U.S., but it is going to be end of life in six months or nine months so doesn't really make a heck of a lot of sense to try to move that. You just finish it out and let that transition when it is done.

TRANSCRIPT SPONSOR :
Bill Stover: Thanks, Kipp. Our third quarter, which ended May 31st, was a challenging quarter. Net sales totaled $1.29 billion, and the company reported a net loss of $225 million, or $0.29 per diluted share. Year-to-date, the Company reported a loss of $0.21 per share, on net sales of $4.25 billion.  The major factors affecting this quarter's results were, one: significant growth in industry memory supply, which caused average selling price erosion across DRAM and NAND memory; two: noteworthy cost per megabit reductions achieved by the company for its DRAM and NAND devices, which could not keep pace with ASP declines, and three: progress made on reductions and overhead expenditures.  Research and development expense levels in the third quarter declined as expected, reflecting the success of the NAND ramp in our Utah IM/Flash wafer fab. R&D expense for the next quarter will likely run between $200 million and $220 million, as we ramp 50-nanometer NAND devices prior to their qualification. Our attention on further reductions in overhead costs is achieving results, as SG&A expenses were down approximately 12% compared to the prior quarter, and approaching a single digit percentage relationship to sales.  For the next quarter, we expect SG&A to run between $130 million and $140 million. The dollars in inventory increased $156 million over the quarter. More than two-thirds of the increase was in the form of work in process and raw materials, representative of increased wafer production in Virginia and Utah. Mike will speak to the finished goods inventory status.  In the third quarter, the company issued $1.3 billion of convertible debt with a 1.875% coupon. The notes are due in 2014, and are convertible into 91 million underlying common shares. The financing provided a near-term attractive spread and positioned the company well for future growth.  Our capital spend forecast for fiscal 2008 is $2.5 billion, with $2 billion of that targeted for 300-millimeter fabs, and three-quarters of that amount targeted for IM/Flash NAND operations. Approximately $500 million of the 2008 forecast is expected to be funded by partner contributions.  I will turn the commentary over to Mike. 
Mike Sadler: Thanks, Bill. We continue to see solid demand for our semiconductor memory products. This is driven primarily by strength in the computing industry. We are seeing an improving demand for image sensors as the mobile phone supply chain has recovered from an inventory overhang dating back to last year.  Despite the demand strength and encouraging signs pointing to stronger demand in the second half of the calendar year, the memory business in particular has been under profitability pressure due to persistent oversupply. Moving forward, I am optimistic about a more favorable supply/demand balance as we see the impacts of memory content expansion, new end product introductions, seasonal demand upticks, and a slowing industry-wide output growth rate.  The computer makers and other consumers of DRAM have a strong appetite for more DRAM. This is a result of robust end markets for products such as PCs and servers. Just as importantly, these products contain rich memory content.  Micron increased DRAM bit shipments by about 30% quarter-over-quarter, and this could not have been achieved in a weak demand environment. Even with the demand strength, the 35% quarter-over-quarter DRAM ASP decline overwhelmed the bit growth, resulting in the revenue and profitability decline.  On the bright side, at current price levels, the DRAM bill of materials cost for a typical PC are quite low. There is plenty of room for ASP increases that will keep memory pricing at a comfortable level for PC makers, given historical price ranges. Continued Vista operating system penetration and complexity of various computing applications demand the additional memory, and the low pricing is facilitating that expansion.  Our specialty DRAM projects, which are geared to non-PC applications, such as mobile phones, automobiles, networking equipment, and a variety of consumer electronics devices are delivering both value to the customer base, and positive financial results for the Company.  We have not seen nor do we expect to see the same level of price volatility in the specialty products that we have experienced in the more commoditized DRAM products. We are rolling out a family of high-density low-power DRAM products on our 78-nanometer process, to complement the existing portfolio of mobile device products. These parts are available in both discreet form, and as part of a multichip package incorporating our NAND Flash technology.  On the NAND front, after a couple of quarters of industry-wide oversupply that was accompanied by dramatic selling price reductions, we see supply and demand balance and relatively stable market pricing. The fact that this stability is occurring in the first half of the calendar year fueled our optimism. As we head into the second half, we will see both a seasonal lift, and the introduction of some highly anticipated new products from our customers that are NAND Flash intensive.  Our 72-nanometer MLC devices have reached yield maturity ahead of schedule, and we are starting the production ramp of 50-nanometer MLC at the Utah factory. The aggressive technology deployment resulted in an approximate 75% quarter-over-quarter bit shipment increases in fiscal Q3. Fiscal Q4 will be another quarter of solid output growth.  Looking beyond the current year, we are seeing a tremendous amount of interest from customers hoping to incorporate solid state drives into their product lineup, utilizing our NAND technology. Solid state storage proliferation will result in strong creation of new demand from Micron, and we couldn't be more pleased with our technology and asset positioning to take advantage of this.  Our customers in the mobile phone arena appear to have worked through inventories, and are now back to consuming Micron image senators to meet current sell-through demand. Our imaging business saw only a moderate revenue decline quarter-over-quarter, after substantially negative growth associated with the inventory correction in fiscal Q2.  The entire portfolio of sensors utilizing our advanced 1.7-micron pixel, ranging from VGA through 8-megapixel density, are being embraced by our customers. We have stacked up a number of design wins that are in the early stage of production, or moving to production throughout the balance of the year.  This has clearly been a challenging quarter to say the least, primarily due to the oversupply of the memory market. We are pleased with our execution on the technology front, and firmly believe that we are in an industry-leading position, with respect to production deployment of advanced memory process technology.  Demand for all products is good, and we believe it will continue to improve as we move through the balance of the year. We also believe that industry-wide output growth will dissipate in the same timeframe, and are optimistic that we will experience an improved market environment.  With that, I will turn it over to Steve. 
Steve Appleton: Thanks, Mike. I just had a couple of brief comments around the introduction of Mark Durcan, who we appointed President and COO. Mark was previously the COO, and before that he was our CTO. And just a note of interest, Mark and I basically started around the same timeframe, 23, 24 years ago.  So he has obviously made an enormous amount of contribution to the Company over the years, and he is certainly going to help me out, as we really tackle, you know I think what is a pretty competitive environment as we move forward. So I just wanted to do that introduction, and then I am going to turn it over for questions, and we'll go from there. 
Kipp Bedard: Thanks, Steve. Now let's go ahead and take some questions from callers. Just a reminder, if you are using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset when asking a question, so that we can hear you clearly. Is the operator still with us? For those of you who are still on the call, we have lost our operator, and we will get her connected, and we will restart the call shortly. 
Operator: Thank you. Our first question is coming from Doug Freedman. 
Doug Freedman - American Technology: Challenging times on the pricing front, so without belittling that, I am very curious as to your comment about the initiative that the Company is taking. If you can take some time and go into some more detail on what type of things you are looking at there to improve the efficiencies and operations of the Company? 
Steve Appleton: Yes, sure. This is Steve. Well, obviously, you talk about details, I don't think we want to give away some things that maybe doing it would be a competitive advantage for us, but we have been, we don't operate in a vacuum, and we have been consistent at looking at the benchmarks, which we compete against from other companies around their technology positioning, which we think by the way, we are in great shape on, also when you look at overhead structure, which is inclusive of R&D and SG&A, and so forth, we just think we need to make changes there, and better align the Company, and make us more efficient.  And so we are doing quite a few things on that front. And realistically, it takes a little bit of time to get through that quarter to, and some of it may take a few quarters, but we just have to realign the Company, and make sure that our structure is comparable to those that we are competing against, which we will do, and we have been looking at lots of benchmarks around that, because we think that our technology is very, very good.  And when you look at the basic place that we're in for the geometry alignment, the yields, et cetera, we like where we are at. We just aren't cost effective enough in the rest of the things in the Company, and that's what we have got to focus on. 
Doug Freedman - American Technology: All right, there are other, Steve, if I look at the company, you really have transitioned it over the last two, three years where we now have a real serious image sensor business, we now have a real serious NAND business.  Are there other lines of business that you are looking at that might offer higher-margin opportunities than the present core memory market? Is that something that you are looking at? Is that one of the things that is being investigated? 
Steve Appleton: If you are referencing a separate category of semiconductors, the answer would be no. We don't think that we are well-positioned to go after something at the moment that we are not already in. If it has to do with things around the products that we are making, like peripherals, companionships, controllers, et cetera, then sure, we are driving pretty hard on that.  Where we are I think looking more and more, is along the lines what you saw occur with Lexar, which is, are there other downstream products, where we can be much more involved in the channel, and try to participate in whatever margin gets generated downstream.  So yes, we are doing those kinds of things, and we are also continuing to look at partnerships, where we can have a more cost efficient development structure, whether it be something that’s in the form factor downstream, like in SSD or a card, et cetera, or where we could get more efficient on the cost of developing the basic technology, things like we have done with Intel on the NAND production JV, and so forth.  So we are not pursuing a different semiconductor category, but clearly we are still driving pretty hard on getting a, what I would consider to be a economic model, on both product development and what you would think of as your basic semiconductor process and design development. 
Doug Freedman - American Technology: The one statement in your release that really interests me the most I think was the fact that you said that there are some initiatives that would be affected immediately. Is there anything around that? Is that, are you looking at layoffs or rationalization of, anything you can do to help with the immediate part? 
Steve Appleton: Yeah, clearly, there are, those are what you would think of as the more typical things that companies do. So I think the way to characterize it is we expect to have lower levels in employment after we go through some of these initiatives here in the more immediate term, but I just need to clarify that some things, like IMST, are still expanding as we ramp those facilities, and we would be crazy to try to starve that investment of people to do that work.  In other cases, we are looking to just eliminate certain functions, or partner with someone else who can do the function more efficiently than us. And yes, we are doing all those things as well. And that will be more in the immediate term, and obviously some of the things I mentioned earlier will be a little longer term. 
Doug Freedman - American Technology: All right. Thank you. I guess I will leave it to the rest of the queue to dig into some of the operating details. Thanks, guys. 
Steve Appleton: Thanks. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Masdea from Credit Suisse. 
Michael Masdea - Credit Suisse: I assume all of that is factored in there, and that there's no additional spending savings that can be coming on top of that. Is that correct? 
Kipp Bedard: Hey, Michael, could you repeat that? 
Michael Masdea - Credit Suisse: Yeah, sure. Bill gave us guidance for spending on the operating lines for this coming quarter, I just want to make sure, make clear that these initiatives that Steve's talking about aren't going to add any more cost savings to those numbers? 
Steve Appleton: When you say cost savings, this is Steve, when you say cost savings, remember we are already a month into our final quarter, so in fact, it might be worth noting that in the event that we have some restructuring that we do, I suppose there could be some charge there, although we don't think it would be big.  But in future quarters, we were very explicit to say what we thought would happen the quarter we are in, because we don't think we can impact it that much, in terms of cost savings by virtue of what I just mentioned, that we will be doing some restructuring. But beyond that, clearly the intent is to improve upon where we are today. So that is not baked into the number that Bill referenced to the quarter we are in. 
Michael Masdea - Credit Suisse: Got it, thank you. And then Mike, you sound pretty confident on the supply side, the slowing growth. Can you just give us some color on what is driving your thinking and your confidence there? 
Mike Sadler: On the supply side, it is a combination of what we are hearing from our customers, and the concern that they have about enough supply to fuel the demand growth in the second half of the year, and the public announcements made by our competitors through various earnings calls, and analyst conferences, and such. 
Michael Masdea - Credit Suisse: Great, thanks. The last one from me really is on the cost side. You have had some really good cost reductions. And help us think going forward what is in front of you in terms of potential cost reductions. Should we see a slowing in the cost reductions here, or how do you look at both the NAND and DRAM piece on the cost side? 
Mark Durcan: Mike, this is Mark. I’d say on the DRAM side, I think in terms of probably down mid-single digits Q-over-Q, and NAND generally speaking, continue on that 20% average trend quarter-over-quarter. 
Michael Masdea - Credit Suisse: Great. Congratulations, Mark, to you too, and thank you very much. 
Mark Durcan: Thanks. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Can you hear me okay. 
Mark Durcan: Yeah, we hear you great. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Great. First question Mike, you commented about the slowing industry supply growth. And I heard your answer to Mike Masdea. So if I think about it from the standpoint of the equipment companies shipments to the DRAM industry are going to be up about 10% to 15% this quarter, that would suggest more supply coming online, not less. Am I thinking about that correctly? 
Mike Sadler: I don't know, I can't specifically tie the DRAM, the capital equipment providers' shipments with output, but I am only kind of paraphrasing what our customers are saying, in terms of supply growth from our competition, as well as probably more relevant, more relevancy would be what the actual manufacturers are saying with respect to their output.  As you know, Jim, calendar Q1 was a huge output quarter for everybody in this industry, including ourselves. Calendar Q2, it looks like growth rates are going to come down somewhat from calendar Q1, and the guidance that the competition is providing for the second half of the year is obviously still growth, but down significantly from the rates that we saw in the first part of the year. 
Kipp Bedard: Jim, this is Kipp. I can add a little bit to our internal research. One of the things we look at are stepper shipments. If you look at the public reports by a couple of the major ones, here are some of the numbers to keep in mind. They were originally planning on shipping mid-80 steppers in Q1 from one particular company. They shipped 50-some and they are guiding in calendar Q2 as 30-some.  So a pretty significant reduction in the anticipated leading edge equipment that you have to have, before you can add significant supply. So that’s another side note to why we think supply is easing going forward. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: That is helpful, thank you. My follow-up, if you could just give us, if prices stayed flat from here to the end of the quarter, what would your quarter-over-quarter decline be, say in PC or commodity DRAM, and what would it be in NAND, if any? 
Mike Sadler: Sure, if we saw, so we are three weeks into fiscal Q4, for those of you who don't follow our fiscal calendar that closely, if prices remained flat on the nose from where they are today, in the DRAM arena, we would be down quarter-over-quarter about 20 to 25%. In the NAND Flash, we would be roughly flat, maybe up a couple percentage points. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Thank you very much. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Shawn Webster from J.P. Morgan. 
Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.: Thank you. Can you guys hear me all right? 
Kipp Bedard: Yes, we can, Shawn. 
Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.: Okay, good. Can I circle back up to your CapEx update? I thought I heard that your CapEx guidance was for 2.5, or I think I misheard that. What's your CapEx guidance for fiscal '07? 
Bill Stover: Actually, the 2.5 reference we provided was for 2008. The $4 billion estimate that we have had for the whole of fiscal year '07 still looks good. 
Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.: Okay, so no change there? 
Bill Stover: Correct. 
Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.: Okay. Then on the, so you talked about your DRAM bit shipment sequentially, can you give us an update on DRAM production in fiscal Q3, and what to expect for Q4? 
Steve Appleton: Yes. We think Q4 we are going to guide you to low double digits on DRAM bit production. 
Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.: What did you see in Q3? 
Steve Appleton: Mark and his team did a pretty good job, and I believe we were up mid to high teens. 
Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.: Okay. And then same thing for your NAND production? What did you produce in Q3, and what do you expect for Q4? 
Bill Stover: We are still guiding to 50% plus sequential quarters, and we were well above 70%, 75% actually, for the production in calendar, excuse me, fiscal Q3. 
Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.: Okay. And then turning to the inventory levels, was some of the increase in inventories we saw in your fiscal Q3 a result of the quall of Utah, or --? 
Bill Stover: That is correct. 
Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.: Okay. And what is the composition of the inventory now and I guess in general buckets, it just makes me a little nervous I guess looking at it because it's so high compared to your own history. What can you tell us to give us some comfort that it's not going to impact your ability to grow your margins in the second half, and maybe tell us what the composition is? 
Steve Appleton: Mike, why don't you start with the finished goods inventory discussion, and we will wrap up with the whip discussion? 
Mike Sadler: I would be happy to. With respect to the finished goods that we are carrying out of fiscal Q3, we have got roughly four weeks of supply of DRAM. That varies by commodity and specialty. But if I kind of aggregate everything, it's about four weeks worth of supply at today's ship rates.  In the NAND Flash area, we are hand to mouth, so we are less than one week of supply. On image sensors, we brought inventory down, but we are still right at about a quarter's worth of finished goods inventory. 
Steve Appleton: And on whip, just in broad brush form, keep in mind we are growing fabs here, and we put two pretty big fabs, one is completely on-line compared to previous years, we have got another one that’s about 20 to 25% ramped. So keep in mind that we have got significant wafer input that is going to continue to grow for us through really at least about summer '08 at least. 
Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.: Okay. You talked about; you guys obviously had really substantial bit shipment growth in your DRAM. Can you talk about your, I guess customer tone? I thought I heard you guys’ mention that they were getting eager to perhaps buy components going into the seasonally strong part of the year. How much of the spot price stabilization would you characterize as forward buying, versus changes in the supply environment? Can you help us understand some of the dynamics there? 
Mike Sadler: Hard for me to clearly distinguish between how much of the spot price increases we could contribute to real demand or to an effort by some of our OEM customers to accumulate inventory. By the way there certainly is, I am observing some effort to accumulate inventory on the part of the OEMs. But what we are looking at is actually a stronger demand scenario, primarily because of the seasonal aspects, but also for some of the things I spoke about earlier in the prepared comments.  New product introductions, just in general quite a bit more memory content per system. We are looking at a calendar Q3 increase in DRAM demand from our core customers of about 20%. If I were to project forward into Q4, about 15% more above Q3. So quite a bit stronger in terms of demand in the second half, and I would reiterate that the first half was pretty good in terms of demand as well.  The issues that we will be facing are really the oversupply, which has been driving the price down. Demand has been quite healthy, and it looks to be even healthier in the second half of the year. 
Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.: Thank you. 
Bill Stover: Shawn, let me correct one thing I said. I said that production bit growth in the quarter was up mid- to high teens. It was actually up mid- to high 20s. 
Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.: Thanks. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Wong from A.G. Edwards. 
David Wong - A.G. Edwards & Sons: Thank you very much. I am not sure if I was confused, but I thought last quarter you said something about NAND cost per bit going flattish this quarter because of the Lehigh startup? Did that actually happen, and you got even better cost improvements than you expected, or do you have some charges coming at some point in the future? 
Kipp Bedard: No, David, your memory is very good. We did say Flash, and we did execute ahead of that. On a timing basis, Lehigh is running about on schedule from a wafer perspective, but we are doing significantly better than anticipated on yields. We think as we move into the next quarter, we will still be able to hit that 20 percentish plus Q-over-Q number. 
David Wong - A.G. Edwards & Sons: Great. Your CapEx plan for the next fiscal year, a sharp drop from the $4 billion of this year. Can you give us some feel as to what this translates to in terms of NAND bit growth and DRAM bit growth year-over-year? 
Kipp Bedard: We're not going to do year-over-year for our fiscal year '08 yet. We will do that later on David, so hang tight for us. 
David Wong - A.G. Edwards & Sons: Okay. Great. Thank you very much. 
Kipp Bedard: Next question, please? 
Operator: Our next question is coming from Glen Yeung from Citi. 
Peter Trigarszky- Citigroup: This is Peter for Glen. As you are looking out at module makers, I was wondering if you could talk about what type of activity you have seen between 1 gig and 512 modules, and if you can give us any sense of how box loading is looking to you? 
Mike Sadler: Sure. Earlier, I showed a slide that indicated box loading, we thought today was, this is based on third party data, some were in the neighborhood of 1.2 gigabytes per system. Anecdotally, we are seeing a pretty heavy push from our customers to establish 2 gigabytes as a base. So I guess on the margin, I would expect that we are probably going to be pushing upwards of 1.5 gigabytes on an average basis as we exit calendar 2007.  With respect to the module makers, I presume you are referring to the aftermarket providers. 1 gigabyte is the sweet spot for the aftermarket, and we are supporting that with our 78-nanometer 1-gigabit DRAM on a module. 
Peter Trigarszky- Citigroup: That is helpful. And then on image sensors, if you could talk about, I know last quarter you had lowered your loadings going into this quarter. Could you talk about how inventory could be worked down there, or how you see that potentially progressing? Also in VGA, what are your plans for competing in that space from a cost perspective? And maybe give us some sense of low end versus high end, how that mix is progressing for you? 
Mike Sadler: Sure, sure. I mentioned that we brought our finished goods inventory down on image sensors. We are at about a quarters worth of finished goods inventory. We had crept up slightly higher than that as we exited fiscal Q2. We will take inventories down again in the current quarter.  So we are getting back to where we consider to be a comfortable level of finished goods inventory on image sensors. We are continuing to take more market share in the high end, our 5-megapixel sensor has been a hit in the marketplace on a couple of high end phones, and the volumes continue to increase with that particular chip.  On the low end of the market, the VGA chip, we have introduced a 1/11" VGA chip, or are in process of introducing it to the market currently, and that is basically going to be our low end cost-aggressive solution, if you will, to trying to attack the low end of the market. 
Peter Trigarszky- Citigroup: Great. Thank you. 
Kipp Bedard: Next question, please. 
Operator: Our next question is coming from Daniel Amir from WR Hambrecht. 
Daniel Amir - WR Hambrecht: Thanks a lot. Can you comment a bit about how the 50-nanometer transition is going on the NAND side, you made some comments last quarter, that you thought it was going well, can you comment on that, and also relate it to a bit, your MLC production by year end? 
Mike Sadler: Sure. On the 50-nanometer, first of all, that is still running very, very well, ahead of our expectations. We are running 50-nanometer already in both Virginia and in Lehigh and yields are ahead of target, and still on-track to qualify that on a schedule or maybe slightly ahead.  On MLC, we said last time we are really in a position where we are just letting the market dictate that. We can run essentially as much as the market demands at this point, and having a full portfolio across all technology nodes and densities. 
Daniel Amir - WR Hambrecht & Co.: So what type of percentage is it going to be around 50% by production year-end? 
Mike Sadler: We are over 50% at this point, and we can take it up or down with the market. 
Daniel Amir - WR Hambrecht & Co.: Okay. With regards to your Lexar/Crucial business, since the acquisition, this has been somewhat of a challenging part of your business on the NAND side. Is potential changes that you are going to do here in the business under your organization, is that going to include the Lexar side as well? 
Steve Appleton: Well, actually, I'm not sure where you are getting your reference point. Lexar business for us at least, has dramatically improved from where it was when Lexar was on their own. And in fact, the VP that's been running that has done a great job. And they have really adjusted.  In fact, they are ahead of I think where we think we need to go on some of the benchmarks in the component memory business, and their business is coming right in-line.  And I would say that that business has been relatively or I will call it flat by virtue of them wanting to get their model cleaned up first, but now that that is happening, they are looking to actually start growing again pretty aggressively. 
Daniel Amir - WR Hambrecht & Co.: Okay. And the final question, can you comment what is your image sensor mix here on 1-megapixel and above and VGA? 
Mike Sadler: Sure. Let me just do some quick math here. In the quarter that we just completed, at 1-megapixel and above, well, well over half. Probably closer to two-thirds to three-quarters of total unit shipments were 1-megapixel and above. 
Daniel Amir - WR Hambrecht & Co.: Okay. Thanks a lot. 
Kipp Bedard: You bet. Next question, please. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Gurinder Kalra from Bear Stearns. 
Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns: Hi, it is Gurinder. I guess, what are your views on the industry-wide, or the transitions going on in the industry from the DRAM back to NAND, and how much does that detract from DRAM supply growth in the second half, and add to NAND supply growth, and how does that going to affect the equilibrium you might be seeing in the NAND market, versus the oversupply in the DRAM market? 
Steve Appleton: Well, Gurinder, I think that, I would just characterize it today as being quite a bit different than it was maybe a few years ago. There are several of us now, obviously two other companies in Korea that have the ability to dial back and forth significantly. So I wouldn't take solace in one versus the other. I would just say now all of us can now dial it quite a bit.  And it is hard for us to know exactly what the movement is, but we all do the same calculations on return per square centimeter, selecting our growth margin, etcetera, and how we want to have that product allocated.  So I just think that that portfolio, those two in combination will be relatively balanced going forward, and it's primarily going to be, I think the one that takes the most advantage of it, is the one that can see a little bit further into the future, as to how to allocate those wafers. So that is my perspective. 
Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns: And how easy or hard is it to make these transitions, and what is the hurdle rate for one to actually make this transition back and forth? 
Steve Appleton: Well, the equipment set itself has 90% to 95% cross over. And you can do some things in the fab to make sure you can do that crossover. But let's face it; nobody is going to convert anywhere near, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% of the capacity back and forth.  What we are all really trying to do is move 10% or 20%, or some number like that, back and forth in order to try to get a better balance. So you don't even actually have to have that kind of crossover that exists, in order to achieve what we're trying to do, which is on a relatively lower percentage number basis.  And it really does take just the cycle time of a wafer fab, assuming that you have the silicon in stock, which typically most of us do, because of the crossover and the equipment, you don't have to do much different.  So it takes somewhere in the neighborhood of probably, I would just say three to four months is probably a good measurement to use for most of us to be able to switch that capacity back and forth. 
Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns: All right, thanks very much. 
Kipp Bedard: Next question, please. 
Operator: Our next question is coming from Alex Gauna from UBS Investments. 
Alex Gauna - UBS Investments: I was wondering if you could characterize what is happening with specialty DRAM, and also particularly looking forward, and as it pertains to the demand on the cellular side? 
Mike Sadler: Sure. This is Mike speaking. There are a vast number of applications that are driving our specialty DRAM business. I will start on what we call the legacy business, which is a variety of items, some automotive business, some networking exposure, some mobile phone.  That business is, some of that business is transitioning to more current DRAM interfaces, such as DDR and DDR2, and as a result the revenue level and the unit level for us has been dropping quarter-over-quarter for the past two or three quarters, and we would expect that to continue to be the case.  On the other hand, the segment of the market that is growing more rapidly, probably more rapidly than any other segment would be the mobile phone area, and that is a segment that I addressed earlier, where we are trying to attack with our most advanced process technology, the 78-nanometer DRAM process technology. And we are rolling out a series of new products to try and increase our business.  In general, our specialty DRAM business declined slightly in fiscal Q3, and we would expect it to decline again slightly in fiscal Q4. We will hopefully get back in a growth mode as we increase our penetration into mobile phone side with the low-powered DRAM products. 
Alex Gauna - UBS Investments: Now, what is that slight decline doing to your gross margins, and when would you, at the earliest be hopeful that some of the new mobile DRAM efforts can take hold? 
Mike Sadler: In terms of an impact on our margins, all I would say is that as our specialty DRAM products decline, it does obviously have an adverse impact on our overall DRAM gross margins. I am not going to quantify it for you.  In terms of us gaining back share in the low-power DRAM area in mobile phones, that is probably going to be a late 2007 or early 2008 type of phenomenon.  We continue to hold a strong market share position in mobile phones with our pseudo-static RAM products, but our share position in the standard low-powered DRAM area in mobile phones is negligible. 
Alex Gauna - UBS Investments: Okay. I know you commented on some firming that we have seen in the CMOS imaging sensor. What is the expectation here seasonally going forward, and also with regard to mix? Are we in a position where we should see an up trend now, and if so, how much? 
Mike Sadler: We are going to, certainly, the mobile phone industry is going to ship more phones in the second half of the year, than they did in the first half of the year. I think that is a pretty safe bet, and it is generally in agreement with what any third party prognosticator would provide. We specifically are going to continue to grow our share most assuredly in the high end. So in the 3-megapixel and 5-megapixel area, and in the 8-megapixel area in particular, what that's going to mean in terms of our overall unit shipments, it's difficult to say, but certainly we are growing share in the high end, and with the new VGA chip that I referred to earlier we are hoping to create a renewed market share position for ourselves in the low end. 
Alex Gauna - UBS Investments: Okay. Reading between the lines, you are acknowledging that you may have lost some modest share here in the low end. Again, asking the question, when can those share losses turn around, at least with the new product introductions, is that also a late '07/early '08 phenomenon? 
Mike Sadler: I am confident that we have got the design wins to do it, it is just a question of whether we got, whether we are into the particular phone models that are really going to hit, in terms of being market successes. So it is really difficult for me to say, but from a design coverage standpoint, we have got the market blanketed. 
Alex Gauna - UBS Investments: Okay. Last one, if I could. With regard to overall inventory, are you in a position, do you think, to bring that down next quarter? Does it need to grow to support seasonal ramp? What is the expectation there? 
Steve Appleton: Mike, would you like to take the finished goods part of that, and we will address the rest of it? 
Mike Sadler: Sure. We are continuing to grow both Flash output and DRAM output pretty significantly in the current quarter, and we are seeing a stronger demand environment. It is difficult really for us to say what is going to happen over the course of the next ten weeks, but output is going to grow tremendously, and it's going to be a challenge in order to basically find homes for all the output as we continue to pump it out. 
Bill Stover: Kipp has given some indications as to production growth on both the DRAM and the NAND side for the next quarter, next couple of quarters. And those increases would suggest, reflective of Utah and some of the Manassas and text conversion to 300-millimeters, so you're going to see some growth, but modest growth in work in process. 
Alex Gauna - UBS Investments: All right, thank you. 
Kipp Bedard: You bet. Next question, please. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Tim Luke from Lehman Brothers. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers: Thank you. Kipp, I was wondering if you might be able to give what you thought the big growth might be with respect to the specialty area, in suggesting that the revenue might be a little lower in the coming quarter? 
Kipp Bedard: Yes. We are guiding to a high-single digit, low-double digit bit growth in the specialty DRAM area quarter-to-quarter. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers: Just to be clear, on the NAND side, notwithstanding the 50% bit growth, you would continue to expect the revenues to be only flattish, is that correct? 
Kipp Bedard: We didn't, no, we didn't make any projection for revenues. You will have to make an ASP assumption and then multiply that. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers: If the ASPs were flat from where they are today, you thought it would be 1 or 2, is that right? 
Kipp Bedard: If the ASPs are flat from today, then average selling prices quarter to quarter would be flat to slightly up, and then multiply that times the number of bits you believe we will ship. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers: Great. I was really just wondering as a financial clarification, it looked like your other income was positive, around the $18 million range. How should we think about that going forward, the other income development? 
Bill Stover: The other income was a result of some equipment sales this particular quarter, a little bit of exchange gain, and government assistance in our Xi'an operation. Going forward, take a long-term assumption that that is going to be flat. Just no significant amounts there. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers: Thanks very much, guys. 
Kipp Bedard: Tim, just so we are clear for modeling purposes, the formula that I provided for you of course, is only good on 50% of the output, that which Micron is selling itself. Keep in mind the ASP on the Intel portion is different. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers: Okay. Thank you. 
Kipp Bedard: You bet. Next question, please. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Bill Dezellem from Tieton Capital Management. 
Bill Dezellem - Tieton Capital Management: Thank you. A couple questions. First of all, relative to the ramp in the NAND process technology going ahead of plan, would you please detail why it is that you believe that that process ramp is ahead of schedule?  And then secondarily, Mike, early in your opening comments, I believe you mentioned that customers have concern about supply over the second half of this calendar year. Would you please detail kind of which product categories, meaning NAND, PC DRAM, specialty DRAM, and/or image sensors, where those concerns are specifically directed? 
Mark Durcan: Let me take the first part, and I will hand it back to Mike, Bill. On the 50-nanometer NAND ramp, as we ramped Lehigh, it was gated by two things. One was the equipment installation, and the other, of course, was where we were getting more bits per wafer, a more cost effective answer for the marketplace. So as we have introduced that technology, we really have experienced better-than-expected yields, and therefore have a crossover that we anticipate is going to occur much earlier than possible, than previously estimated.  We are also very, very comfortable with the progress we are making relative to some of the intricacies around cycling performance and liability on the NAND Flash. So all put together, we are just very comfortable with the way it's going, and that's been driven by not only a great job by the technology team, but also by the manufacturing team doing a very effective job of transferring the technology from Fab 4 into Manassas and then out to Lehigh. 
Bill Dezellem - Tieton Capital Management: And Mark, before we switch over to Mike, are you sensing that structurally what you are experiencing is repeatable, or were there some special benefits that you received from these particular process ramps? 
Mark Durcan: We have changed some things structurally internally, relative to how we go about developing and deploying technology as we have transitioned to these new technology nodes rolling out on 300-millimeter fabs. So we have complete alignment now between our 300-millimeter fabs and our R&D operation relative to toolset, which we haven't had historically. And we also I think have better alignment between the manufacturing teams and technology development teams, as to exactly what the methodology is going to be, and what gets transferred exactly and what gets modified, and how that goes about happening. So we have essentially structurally changed how we go about deploying technology, and we are seeing repeatable results across numerous transfers to numerous fabs now. 
Mike Sadler: Bill, this is Mike speaking. On the supply concerns from customers, with respect to the proprietary or non-commodity products, we have a very efficient and effective and transparent information exchange with our customers, such that we understand their demand quite well, they understand our supply capability, thus, we are able to provide them with long-term supply assurance, such that there is not a whole lot for them to worry about.  The concerns I was speaking about earlier are specifically on the commodity memory area, basically commodity NAND for the consumer electronic products, and commodity DRAM, primarily for the notebook and desktop PC products, where frankly speaking customers are just uncertain about what the supply environment is going to look like with any level of specificity, thus they are somewhat concerned about supply assurance from the entire supply base, that they move through what they are expecting is going to be a very strong demand period. 
Bill Dezellem - Tieton Capital Management: Thank you both. 
Kipp Bedard: Next question, please. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Joe Osha from Merrill Lynch. 
Joe Osha - Merrill Lynch: Hi, guys. Asked and answered, so thanks very much. 
Kipp Bedard: Okay. Thanks, Joe. Next question, please. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Eric Rubel from Miller Tabak Roberts. 
Eric Rubel - Miller Tabak Roberts: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. One, quick one on segment revenue. Could you break out the segment revenue for image sensor, and talk about the segment gross margin? 
Bill Stover: The revenues for the quarter came in just above 10% of the total, and we have not been giving specific margin information. 
Eric Rubel - Miller Tabak Roberts: Okay. Then if I can ask on, back in September in New York at the Analyst Day, you guys updated us on process at, I believe, 0.11 pixel size 1.75, and a wafer size of about 200-millimeter. Can you update us on how you see that playing out for fiscal 2008 for process, pixel size, and wafer? And I have one more follow-up. 
Bill Stover: Well, at the leading edge, a lot of our imagers now are transitioning to the 1.75 Micron pixel technology. We previously announced the 1.4 Micron pixel but that will be a bigger part of our production, a little further out in the future. And was the other question on 200-millimeter versus 300-millimeter wafer capacity? 
Eric Rubel - Miller Tabak Roberts: Yes. 
Bill Stover: 300-millimeter wafer capacity obviously continues to increase as a percent of the total as we ramp out Lehigh, and complete the conversion at tech. I think the way to think of it is in terms of… 
Eric Rubel - Miller Tabak Roberts: I am sorry to interrupt, but I am speaking specifically with image sensor, for the image sensor segment, that all of those products were being done on 200-millimeter. Any change on that? 
Steve Appleton: That is right. We continue to manufacture the image sensor on 200-millimeter. There has always been discussion around the industry thinking about running 300-millimeter, in fact I think one of our competitors has done so, I think they are primarily doing that, because they have old 300-millimeter equipment they can't really use anymore for memory.  In our particular case, when we look at the cost crossover on that, we don't think it will be cost effective for quite some time. The reason is really a pretty simple one. If you want to go out and buy a piece of a 300-millimeter equipment today then you're going to buy a piece of equipment that can run 50, 60-nanometer type capability, and frankly none of us are running our image sensors on processors that are down at 50 or 60-nanometers, nobody does.  So you are paying for the tool, but you're not utilizing it for the capability. In our particular case, I think as many of you know, we run a model where it's on a tool set that as an X minus 1 or X minus 2 generation, and that tool set has already used its life so to speak for us on the memory front, so it's very, very cost effective for us to use it, because in large part it has been depreciated, and it is a tool set that we would have sold for lower cents on the dollar, then actually get use out of it. So, from our perspective, it’s a great model that works for us. And that’s why we continue to do the 200-millimeter.  As a follow-on note, there clearly will be a time when we are in that situation for 300 millimeter equipment, and as that occurs, we’ll look at the cost effectiveness of taking 300-millimeter equipment that was running memory, and then transferring it over and running image sensors on it, much like we do today on the 200-millimeter, because we think that’s really the way to get the most cost effective part out. 
Eric Rubel - Miller Tabak Roberts: Thanks for clarifying that, Steve. And if I could just ask, how you’re seeing PC unit growth, how does it look? 
Mike Sadler: Somewhere in the neighborhood of 10% to 12% for the year. I think relative to 2006. 
Eric Rubel - Miller Tabak Roberts: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. 
Kipp Bedard: You bet. Next question, please. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Krishna Shankar from JMP Securities. 
Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities: Yes. Can you…? 
Kipp Bedard: Sorry, Krishna, we can't hear you here. Would you mind repeating that, please? And maybe let's go to the next questioner, please. Do we still have the operator with us?

Wilbur G. Stover: Thanks, Kipp. I will first summarize the financial results for the quarter and the six months ended March 1st. For the second quarter, net sales totaled $1.43 billion, approximately 16% above the same quarter a year ago but down from the immediately preceding quarter. For the quarter, the company recorded a net loss of $52 million, or $.07 per diluted share. For the six months, the company recorded net income of $0.08 per share on net sales of $2.96 billion.  The major factors affecting this quarter’s results were: significant average selling price erosion across DRAM and NAND memory; sales volumes in specialty DRAM and image sensors down, largely as a result of the widely acknowledged slowdown in sales of handsets; and the company achieved noticeable cost reductions for its DRAM and NAND devices.  Gross margin for the quarter dropped to 25% as the magnitude of average selling price declines could not be offset by reductions in costs for parts.  Research and development expense levels in the second quarter reflect the wafer processing charges through qualification of new NAND devices and our 300 millimeter operation in Virginia, particularly our 72 nanometer 8 gig MLC device. We have acknowledged that our ramp of the Utah 300 millimeter NAND operations on devices previously qualified in Virginia is on schedule and going well. R&D expense for Q3 will likely run between $200 million and $220 million. Future quarters will vary depending upon quantities of preproduction wafers processed across our global fab network.  Selling, general and administrative expenses were down approximately 15% compared to the prior quarter. We had previously communicated targeted reductions in overhead and are on track to accomplish those reductions in fiscal year ’08. For the next couple of quarters, we expect SG&A to run between $140 million and $150 million.  There are a couple of changes on the balance sheet worth commenting on. Total inventory dollars increased $179 million over the quarter, with approximately half of that increase being in finished goods. The growth in work-in-process inventories was commensurate with the production ramp at Manassas, Virginia.  Two-thirds of our forecast capital spending for ’07 occurred in the first-half of the year, and with incremental equipment financing placed in the second quarter, our debt-to-equity ratio remains quite low at 10%.  I will turn the commentary over to Mike. 
Michael W. Sadler: Thanks, Bill. The market presented us with challenges in fiscal Q2 as we managed through a variety of factors, including slow demand attributed to seasonality, inventory overhang in mobile phones, and an oversupplied DRAM market spurred on by industry-wide output growth.  We have always felt the impact of demand seasonality in the computing market as the industry tends to experience seasonal demand spikes around the back-to-school and Christmas times, both falling in the second-half of the calendar year.  As Micron products have penetrated higher-growth consumer markets, such as mobile phones and personal audio players, exposure to seasonal demand has actually increased. We felt the effect of this in our fiscal Q2.  In addition to seasonal impacts, a number of customers in the consumer electronics space, most specifically in mobile phones, exited the holiday period with measurable amounts of finished goods and semiconductor component inventory. The net effect was a reduced appetite from these customers even beyond normal seasonal patterns for Micron products such as NAND flash, low power DRAM including pseudo-static RAM, and image sensors.  As a result, we accumulated some inventory in the mobile phone component space in fiscal Q2 and are making output level adjustments in an effort to generally rebalance. We are fortunate in having designed some flexibility into our manufacturing processes such that multiple products with different functionality can be manufactured utilizing a common toolset.  On the bright side, with the inventory in place, we are in good shape to be able to support upside business from our customers as they work through their inventories and resume growth.  While the mobile phone component revenue level paused in fiscal Q2, our product development efforts have not skipped a beat. In the imaging area, we are continuing to hold position as the technology leader, garnering key design wins in high-end phones with our advanced two-, three-, and five-megapixel sensors and in the digital still camera area with our new eight-megapixel chips.  We are introducing a series of cost-reduced imagers and low density pseudo-static RAM chips to take advantage of one of the key growth segments, the lower bill of material costs mobile phones for growing markets in China and India.  We have moved our 72 nanometer 8 gigabit MLC NAND chip to mass production and are confident that we have intercepted the competition technologically. We have completed development of the 50 nanometer process, seen initial silicon on our first 16 gigabit 50 nanometer MLC chip, and will ramp this on the heels of the 72 nanometer process in the Boise, Virginia and Utah factories.  About one month into the quarter and well past the holiday period, DRAM demand exceeded supply, market prices were increasing, and customers were generally in the mindset of supply acquisition and inventory accumulation.  In January, market dynamics shifted quite abruptly. I believe this shift was primarily attributed to industry-wide supply expansion and secondarily to seasonal demand softness. The end result was an immediate shift in customer behavior from DRAM inventory accumulation to DRAM inventory depletion, which in turn resulted in a DRAM market price reduction. Prices steadily declined since January into and through the first month of fiscal Q3. In the past several days, we have seen both DRAM and NAND prices stabilize. We are quite bullish on demand prospects for the balance of this year as electronic equipment unit sales continue to be robust and a variety of factors are leading to strong content growth for both DRAM and NAND flash.  In particular, we believe 2007 PC DRAM content per system growth will exceed 50% and the move to solid state discs and flash-based video players is being accelerated as elasticity kicks in from the NAND price declines of the past year or so.  On the DRAM technology front, Micron could not be in better shape. Our 78-nanometer process has reached yield maturity in record time and, coupled with our 6F squared circuit design, we believe we have a significant die size advantage relative to the competition. This, in addition to our continued growth of 300-millimeter production, translates to substantial cost per bit reductions and productivity increases.  The flagship product on the 78-nanometer process node, the 1 gigabit DDR2 chip, is being placed on a variety of high density module configurations for the server, desktop and notebook markets. We are rolling out an entire portfolio of new DRAM products for all market segments on this technology as we move forward.  The company is executing well across a variety of fronts in all three of our product areas, DRAM, NAND, and CMOS imagers. We see significant intermediate and long-term demand drivers for all three of these product segments. With just a bit of cooperation from the markets, we look forward to demonstrating this execution to our customers and shareholders.  I will turn it back over to Kipp. 
Kipp A. Bedard: Thanks, Mike. We would now like to take questions from callers. Just a reminder, if you are using a speaker phone, please pick up the handset when asking a question so that we can hear you clearly. With that, we would like to open up the line. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions)  Our first question is coming from Michael Masdea of Credit Suisse. 
Michael Masdea - Credit Suisse: What do you think is driving this recent price move in both the NAND and DRAM side and is it sustainable, do you think? 
Michael W. Sadler: Well, that is the multi-billion dollar question, Michael. On the NAND side, I think we are seeing basically that the demand strength, which really has not dissipated at all but we are seeing that I believe catch up with supply and that has resulted in the price stability, which has actually been in place now for a couple of weeks on the NAND side.  On the DRAM side, I think in combination, you know, clearly we are seeing the content growth in the PC area. There is no question about that. Some of that is being driven on the consumer side by the new operating system and other content growth is just being driven by new applications, but I think we are also seeing the effect of the inventory depletion by some of our customers and it has resulted in them getting back into the buying mode again.  This is really only a week or so old so it is too early for us to tell whether it is sustainable, but we are quite encouraged that things appear anyway for the time being to have bottomed out and we have everybody back in the taking mode again, which is quite encouraging. 
Michael Masdea - Credit Suisse: On both the DRAM and the NAND side, give us an idea of what you are expecting in the May quarter in terms of both production and shipment growth. 
Wilbur G. Stover: You bet. Michael, as you probably recall, we do not try to guide you to shipment piece but manufacturing operations are running super right now so our guidance on bit growth for DRAM will be high single digits to low double digits and we are staying consistent with our guidance on bit growth from manufacturing on NAND, which will be north of 50%. 
Michael Masdea - Credit Suisse: I guess the question, another way to ask it is are you going to need inventory to get there or that is pure production, right? 
Wilbur G. Stover: That is pure production. That’s correct. 
Michael Masdea - Credit Suisse: Last one for me real quick is the CapEx side. It does not look like you have changed it, unless I missed it. Any thoughts on the CapEx? Any need to change that? Looking to next year, we have seen a pretty high level of CapEx to sales. Do you see that tend to trend down or any early thoughts on that? 
Wilbur G. Stover: Michael, our reference for fiscal year ’07 had been $4 billion and that is still looking good for ’07. With the progression -- completion, really of Manassas and the significant capacity additions that have already been underway at Lehigh, fiscal year ’08 should see a noticeably reduced capital spending profile. We will update you at the next conference call on an ’08 number but you can anticipate that it is noticeably down from the $4 billion. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Glen Yeung with Citigroup. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup: We have Intel introducing a new notebook platform next month now. I just wanted to get a sense from you what you think the implications are for DRAM consumption. 
Michael W. Sadler: I could not speak specifically to the introduction of the new platform but in general, our view of PC demand is pretty strong and we see it getting stronger as seasonal demand periods kick in here as we move throughout the year. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup: Mike, any inflection points in content per system? Do you think it is a pretty linear trend throughout the course of the year? 
Michael W. Sadler: I think it is probably going to be linear throughout the year until we start to see the effect of the corporate upgrades to the Vista operating system. In our view, that is really maybe an end-of-this-year phenomena if not a 2008 phenomena, and that is going to result in I believe a pretty significant increase. It will probably get layered in over the course of a year but that will result in a pretty significant increase. I guess another way of saying that is that we have not seen any benefit in the corporate area from Vista upgrades yet on content per system and that is still to come. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup: Can I just follow up on that statement you made; is there something that suggests to you it will be end of year or early next? Or is it just your speculation on how you think the -- 
Michael W. Sadler: You know, to be perfectly honest with you, I am just basing that on our own experience, and assuming that we are a typical Fortune 500 company with pretty significant IT needs, we are looking at, if I’m not mistaken, end of this calendar year, if not early next year, and probably some of the contributing factors will be budget but also security -- security of the platform itself. That is probably the most significant factor. 
Mark Durcan: Glen, just one other comment there, there are a lot of inter-related software elements that most corporations need to bundle together with that upgrade and I think it is just later this year before a number of those are available. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup: The other question I had was on the ability to move wafers around between NAND and DRAM and whether or not you had any thoughts to making any changes in your plant and secondarily, if you expect to see any changes in the competition’s plants. 
Steven R. Appleton: As we have indicated before, we do have flexibility between NAND and DRAM. Of course, we work through those changes with our partner, Intel, as we do share NAND capacity with them but we have made adjustments between NAND and DRAM already and I think we will continue to do that as we see the various markets strengthen or weaken relative to each other. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup: Great. Maybe just one last quick one, which is your customers are on the tape now talking about price stability in the second-half of the year for DRAM. I know it is hard for you guys to try to forecast that but I just wonder if you can comment on the reasonableness of that outlook based on what we see in terms of supply and demand. 
Steven R. Appleton: Price stability as opposed to -- 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup: Price stability is kind of an odd thing in DRAM, right? But they are on the tape using that language. Let’s sort of put some quotes around that and just get your thoughts there. 
Steven R. Appleton: Well, there are only two things that contribute to whether price is going up, down or stable and that is relative to the balance of supply and demand. I can really only speak with a lot of knowledge on the demand side and we think, continue to believe that 2007 is going to be a stronger-than-typical year for demand, primarily driven by content per system in the PC area but quite comfortable that we are looking at something north of 60%, 65% in terms of bit growth in demand in 2007.  You guys are the best judge of supply and as far as if it is going to be less than 60% or 65%, prices are going up or are going to be stable. If it is going to be significantly more than 60% or 65%, prices are probably going to keep coming down. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Shawn Webster of JP Morgan. 
Shawn Webster - JP Morgan: Thank you. Good afternoon. Can you talk a little bit -- you mentioned earlier that you thought that you saw depletion in the channel inventory. Can you give us an update on what you are seeing? Maybe a little bit more detail there, and then I have a couple of other follow-ups. 
Steven R. Appleton: Sure. I can’t speak to whether it is the price stability that we have seen in the last week, let’s say, or actual inventory levels being depleted by our customers because I do not see our customers’ inventory levels, but the activity in terms of customers wanting to come in and place pretty significant buys has picked up tremendously just within the last several days, so we are actually looking at customers who have become accustomed to buying day-by-day now looking at layering in forward buys and locking in pricing and so forth. All that anecdotal activity is a pretty good indication to me that our customers believe that things have bottomed out here and they probably feel quite a bit better about the prospect of maybe establishing some inventory buffers today as opposed to when I last spoke to you guys a couple of months ago, which was an entirely different scenario. 
Shawn Webster - JP Morgan: Yes, it sounds like it improved. Can you also tell us what your DRAM shipments did in your fiscal Q2? 
Steven R. Appleton: Sure. Our shipments on a bit basis -- let me make sure I am correct here. I think they were up 10%, 12% quarter over quarter, if I am not mistaken, Q2 versus Q1. 
Shawn Webster - JP Morgan: Bit demand, global bit demand in calendar Q1 and Q2? 
Steven R. Appleton: My assessment would be, and this is directly from polling our customers, that when all is said and done, bit demand in terms of purchases, is going to be down in Q1 versus Q4. In Q2, we are probably looking at growth of -- I am going to give you a pretty wide range, 5% to 15%. That is fresh data right from our customers within the last couple of days. 
Shawn Webster - JP Morgan: Thanks. Finally, can you tell us what your sensor -- give us an update on your sensor business and tell us what it did sequentially or what percentage of sales it is now? 
Steven R. Appleton: In terms of percentage of sales, it is in double digits, between 10% and 15% of total sales. We had negative growth quarter over quarter in both unit shipments and revenues, and I would attribute that to probably three factors, and I will list them in order of significance. Number one would be the impact of the seasonal slowness in demand, if you will, as well as some inventory accumulation to some of our customers occurred, both with mobile phone units themselves as well as semiconductor components. The second would be the increased competitive environment in the CMOS image sensor area. I believe we have lost a bit of market share, as we have seen some pretty aggressive competition from a variety of different players. Number three would be this phenomenon of very low-end mobile phones kind of encroaching on the camera-embedded portion of the mobile phone business. We are basically seeing kind of a near-term retrenchment in camera phone penetration as a result of the growth of the markets, specifically in India and China, of phones without cameras. 
Shawn Webster - JP Morgan: Do you feel like you are seeing a bottom in terms of orders and excess inventory out there? How should we think about your sensor business looking forward? 
Steven R. Appleton: It is going to be tough for us to replicate the kind of growth that we had in place for the last couple of years -- no question about that, as a result of two of those factors that I mentioned earlier, the competitive environment as well as the low-end phones.  We are seeing our camera module integrators, we believe now they are flush on inventory. In other words, they have worked off the inventory that they have accumulated through Q4 and the first part of Q1. In terms of whether we can get, how quickly we can get back to the levels we were going out of 2006, difficult to say. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Nicolas Gaudois of Deutsche Bank. 
Nicolas Gaudois - Deutsche Bank: The first question to follow-up on the image sensors, if you could give us a bit of granularity on what profitability did with revenues down in the quarter, and how should we look at this going into the May quarter? I will have follow-ups. Thank you. 
Wilbur G. Stover: I am going to repeat your question, just so we get it right. I think the question was based on can we give you some trend as to what revenues did from Q1 to Q2 and our expectation for that going forward. Is that correct? 
Nicolas Gaudois - Deutsche Bank: No, it was a question on profitability, on margins effectively in the last quarter and going to the next quarter for the imaging business. 
Wilbur G. Stover: On imaging, we ran low 40% last quarter and we were mid 30’s this quarter. 
Nicolas Gaudois - Deutsche Bank: Great, and next quarter, should we think about this for the business [assuming] a bit of revenue growth maybe or flat for revenues in the May quarter? 
Wilbur G. Stover: Is that question relative to sales or gross margin? 
Nicolas Gaudois - Deutsche Bank: Gross margin. 
Wilbur G. Stover: We are going to stay away from guiding gross margins. It is not something we have historically done for any of our segments. 
Nicolas Gaudois - Deutsche Bank: Fair enough. On the transition to [inaudible] processing orders as expected in your prior quarter. Could you just update us on how fast the transition went so far and maybe revisit the targets you gave us a quarter ago on MLC versus SLC mix by the end of this year? 
Michael W. Sadler: I think we have said before, Nick, that we would be maybe 50% by the end of the year. At this point, we have transitioned a little bit faster than we had indicated previously and while it is tough to predict exactly where that washes out, it is going to be primarily a market decision going forward. We are fully technologically capable and product portfolio capable to just dial that mix between SLC and MLC. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Douglas Freedman of AmTech Research. 
Douglas Freedman - American Technology Research: ASPs, if we could, it looks like DRAM ASPs were down about 15% on the given quarter. If they are flat from here, can you tell us where you would end for the third quarter? 
Michael W. Sadler: If they are flat from -- if DRAM prices were flat from here through the end of the quarter, they would end up being down 20% to 25% quarter over quarter. We have baked in something more aggressive than that in terms of reductions quarter over quarter into our own projections, but again flat from this point forward, they would be down 20% to 25% quarter over quarter. 
Douglas Freedman - American Technology Research: Same question on the NAND side, what are you expecting to see there? 
Michael W. Sadler: Closer to the 5% to 10% down range, if they remain flat. In fact, NAND flash prices have been up over the last week or so. They are continuing to trend up. That is a real difficult one to gauge, but anyway, the direct answer to your question, if they were flat from this point forward, they would be down 5% to 10% quarter over quarter. 
Douglas Freedman - American Technology Research: All right, terrific. Then, at the winter analyst meeting, I remember seeing an R&D number closer to 250. We are six, eight weeks from there. Now it is in the 200 to 220 range. What has changed there? 
Mark Durcan: It really is a function of the qualification of devices. We had a good qual in Virginia on the MLC device and it is just a function of the wafer processing on pre-qual devices, which now looks like will be noticeably down in the current quarter. 
Douglas Freedman - American Technology Research: Okay, and then lastly, you had a great quarter on the execution side holding the cash cost of revenues down. What was your utilization in the quarter? 
Wilbur G. Stover: Basically, Doug, we run 100% all the time. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Daniel Amir from WR Hambrecht. 
Daniel Amir - WR Hambrecht + Co.: Thanks a lot. A couple of questions here on the image sensor side. What was the percentage of your one-megapixel and above revenue unit and what is the VGA mix right now? 
Steven R. Appleton: Okay, on the mix by pixel density in the quarter we completed, about two-thirds 1-megapixel and above, and that would be split roughly 50-50 at 1-megapixel one-third, and two and above about one-third. That leaves VGA at about one-third as well.  In the quarter that we are in, by the way, I am not sure if you asked the question but in the quarter that we are in, I would anticipate the mix is probably going to be roughly in line with that. You did ask a second question. I did not catch it. 
Daniel Amir - WR Hambrecht + Co.: You answered both my questions but then the other question is related to the inventory situation on the image sensor, how long do you feel that this is going to take until you are back to more of a normal ordering pattern? 
Steven R. Appleton: Well, I think you are asking two questions. The normal ordering -- the inventory position, we are heavy, as we mentioned in the opening comments. We are at about a quarter, slightly more than a quarter’s worth of finished goods inventory. We have made adjustments in terms of our wafer inputs to get those back in balance, and our assumptions are we are going to be roughly in balance going out of our current fiscal year, so it is another quarter-and-a-half until we are where we want to be in terms of inventory mix.  Now, having said that, lots can change. We have proven that we are not experts at predicting how quickly the business is going to expand or how quickly it may contract due to inventory problems, so that could change. But given the scenario that we are looking at right now, it looks like it is going to be about the end of the fiscal year before we have inventories back in balance of where we would like them to be. 
Daniel Amir - WR Hambrecht + Co.: Okay, and a final question on the NAND side. I guess you commented a bit about some of the demand drivers that you see for the second-half of the year and some stuff like the solid state drive. What is your prediction right now of the industry NAND bit growth for the year? What is the NAND bit growth at Micron? 
Steven R. Appleton: Sure. The industry right now is sizing up to be somewhere, on a supply side, somewhere in the neighborhood of 120% to 140%. I will let Mike address what we believe to be perhaps potential demand. 
Michael W. Sadler: Well, the demand is going to match what supply growth is going to be, so if it is 140% it is going to be 140%. The industry can absorb what the output is. So it is going to be in line with what the supply growth is. 
Mark Durcan: For Micron, we would assume that our bit growth going forward is going to be 50% quarter over quarter as it has been for the previous few quarters. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Aaron Husock from Morgan Stanley. 
Aaron Husock - Morgan Stanley: Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could comment on how much image sensor pricing was down sequentially in the February quarter. And then also, you mentioned that you felt like your customers had finished working through their excess inventory image sensors. Do you think that business can actually be up sequentially in the May quarter, or are you actually seeing the weakness in end demand for handsets, your largest customer now impacting that? 
Steven R. Appleton: From a pricing standpoint, we were relatively flat quarter over quarter. I don’t want to misrepresent that. We are reducing prices as we need to in order to remain competitive, but we are continuing to migrate up in terms of pixel density and those higher pixel density chips typically sell at a higher average selling price.  In terms of sequential growth in Q3 versus Q2, it is difficult to say. We still have roughly 60 days left in Q3, so it is really difficult for me to say what is going to happen. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from James Covello of Goldman Sachs. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: A couple of questions; I guess the pricing stability you are talking about recently, is that contract or spot pricing? 
Steven R. Appleton: Jim, the spot pricing has ticked up a little bit. You guys can see all the stuff on the web about -- everybody that monitors spot market pricing. It has ticked up a little bit and the contract pricing last time around was relatively flat. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: So you think the next round of contract negotiations would be flat or up? 
Steven R. Appleton: Well, we still have 11 days to go so a lot can happen in the next 11 days. But based on the activity of the last few days, I would think flat to up. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Now, can I ask a question about that? Because you guys said that the problem was driven by supply, not demand. You said inventory is still a little bit out of balance. There is a lot more supply coming online for the remainder of this year than there has been up until now. First of all, because you have all the NAND to DRAM, and second of all, especially your Taiwanese competitors are just bringing on a tremendous amount of supply the rest of the year, so how would that lead to price stability over the next few quarters? 
Steven R. Appleton: Again, it is a relative balance of supply and demand. As I said earlier, you guys are presumably in a lot better position to assess the supply situation than we are. All I can really speak to is the demand side and I feel great about the demand profile going forward, particularly in the PC area for DRAM. Again, I will throw those numbers out; if you think supply growth is going to be greater than 60%, 65%, we are probably looking at price pressure. If you don’t, then I think we are looking at a pretty good pricing environment. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: I do not want to push on it too much, but if demand has been good in the grand scheme of things so far this year and that is not going to change and the supply is going to get greater, I do not understand how the pricing does not keep coming down. 
Steven R. Appleton: Sure. What happened in the last two months is that inventory shifted from the buyer basically to the seller -- at least, in our case it did. In January when prices were still either stable or heading up, all of my customers were glad to get their hands on as much product as they possibly could. I don’t know whether they had two or three or four weeks worth of inventory, but in effect what has happened over the last 60 days as prices started to come down is they shifted that inventory burden back to me. I presume they did that to the other DRAM suppliers as well. Now we are seeing, early, granted but the early signs of a shift back in the other direction where they are willing to get their hands on more inventory now as opposed to being concerned about depleting it. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: On the cost structure side, you guys said that you believe you have the smallest die size. If I look at your margins relative to your competitor’s margins, your margins are a lot lower. So what is the delta between your smaller die size and the lower margins? 
Wilbur G. Stover: What you are going to see, as we’ve talked about, we are on now a significant cost reduction path to where we have been in the low double digits now. I would challenge you to find somebody who is out-executing that, but in the past what you have seen is really lack of scale and additional costs from ramping new fabs. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: I mean, especially on the DRAM side. 
Wilbur G. Stover: Yes, the same holds true. For example, Jim, MTV essentially ran inefficient as we were ramping it up through the last year-and-a-half, and that is now topped off, for example. 
Mark Durcan: Tech Singapore’s migration to 300 millimeters speaks as well to the opportunity yet ahead on the DRAM side. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: I’m sorry. I’m missing something. Is it where you want it to be now? 
Steven R. Appleton: No, we are going to continue to get better at a faster pace. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: But I mean -- I understand that there were inefficiencies or lack of scale in the past, but if that is behind us and the die size is as small as it needs to be, there is a big delta in margins. 
Michael W. Sadler: The other thing I think you need to realize is there is an ongoing technology mix migration as we move more of the manufacturing capacity between technology nodes, so while we I believe from a technology perspective we have the most advanced technology, we do not necessarily have 100% of our capacity there. So we will see an increased surge in productivity as we continue that transition. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: Wouldn’t your competitors have that issue too though? 
Michael W. Sadler: Our competitors are playing in the same environment as us. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Kevin Rottinghaus from Cleveland Research. 
Kevin Rottinghaus - Cleveland Research: Thank you. Do you have a PC unit number for year-over-year growth that your customers communicate to you, or that you try to target? 
Michael W. Sadler: They do not, so all I do is use the same data that you guys do. I think we are looking at 8% to 10% PC unit growth rate ’07 versus ’06, something like that. 
Kevin Rottinghaus - Cleveland Research: Did you anticipate coming into the year that maybe the enterprise might not deploy until late in the year? I guess with enterprise being over half of PC, do you think there is any risk there to that number, based upon maybe a slower migration to Vista? 
Michael W. Sadler: Of course there is risk. Frankly speaking though, for us, what is a lot more relevant in terms of DRAM demand is the amount of memory that is going into a system as opposed to the number of systems that are actually being sold, but of course there is risk. I mean, we are still looking at nine months of the year being forecast and absolutely there is risk. 
Kevin Rottinghaus - Cleveland Research: Do you have a number now for where you think blended DRAM per PC is? 
Michael W. Sadler: Sure. It is in the neighborhood, if I’m not mistaken, we had a slide pulled up earlier that showed it but I think it is about 1 gigabyte, if I am not mistaken. 
Kevin Rottinghaus - Cleveland Research: Okay, and that is up how much so far this year? Where do you think it ends at the end of 2007? 
Michael W. Sadler: I think we are pushing 2 gigabytes by the end of 2007, maybe 1.7, 1.8, something like that. 
Kevin Rottinghaus - Cleveland Research: Are there any price assumptions behind the 60% to 65% bit growth for this year? Is there a certain price level or amount of price decline that you have to hit in order to get to that number? 
Michael W. Sadler: I think the expectations from our customer base were somewhere in the neighborhood of a 30% to 40% annual price decline. Fortunately for them, unfortunately for us, we took that already in the first three months of the year, so we will see going forward. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Hans Mosesmann from Nollenberger Capital. 
Hans Mosesmann - Nollenberger Capital Partners: Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered, but a question on inventories on your balance sheet. Where do you expect them to be if the bit demand does materialize as you expect? 
Wilbur G. Stover: One thing to keep in mind, there’s two components here. On the finished goods side, if in fact the scenario you talk about unfolds, then inventory can move down, obviously. But on the other hand, keep in mind we are ramping a brand new facility, so you should expect [whip] to continue to move up commensurate with the increased wafer loading in the Lehigh fab. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Lau from Jefferies and Company. 
John Lau - Jefferies & Company: Thanks. Kipp, we spoke a lot about topics but I just wanted to summarize. In terms of the incremental changes in order that you have seen recently, you have mentioned that the DRAM was getting stronger, the NAND had continued to be strong in terms of the demand side, and what did you say about CMOS again? 
Kipp A. Bedard: Demand for CMOS image sensors for us, and I believe for the entire industry, was down in the calendar Q1, which would have been roughly in line with our fiscal Q2. 
John Lau - Jefferies & Company: Okay, and then going forward, you mentioned that the cost reductions have been quite significant but were not able at this current quarter to stay ahead of the ASP declines. In terms of how we should think about continued cost reductions in the next couple of quarters, would that be in the 30% to 50% range quarter over quarter or has that changed? 
Steven R. Appleton: I did not quite hear the question. Could you repeat that? 
John Lau - Jefferies & Company: Yes, sorry if I had a problem with my headset, but in terms of your cost reduction on the NAND flash, i.e. as the ASPs continue to go down, what do you project your cost reductions should be, even on a year-over-year basis? 
Steven R. Appleton: We have been guiding to 20% sequentially quarter over quarter, which obviously accumulated would put you down 80% year over year. Now, this particular quarter Q3 that we are in, you are going to see something closer to flattish and then a reacceleration in Q4. The reason for the flattish cost per bit reduction in Q3 is relative to the Lehigh fab ramping up. So we are moving, as you mentioned, I think there was an earlier question as to where the R&D cost went, from going from 250 down to our guidance of 200 to 220, that starts to show up relatively rolling through the cost of goods sold model. 
John Lau - Jefferies & Company: Great, so we can think about in terms of your bit growth in the 50% quarter over quarter rate. You mentioned that the cost is probably going to be down flat and if NAND was to stay flat, you would be down 5% to 10%. Is that just a quick takeaway from the NAND situation? 
Steven R. Appleton: Yes. 
John Lau - Jefferies & Company: Great, and then one final follow-up; how long does it take to shift from NAND to DRAM and back to NAND again, if there was an operation that you wanted to execute on your fab side? How long would that typically take to move that around? Would that be months, quarters -- how does that work out? 
Michael W. Sadler: It depends on the details of how you configure fab. From Micron and at least a couple of our fabs today, it is probably in the order of three to four months. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mark Fitzgerald from Banc of America Securities. 
Mark Fitzgerald - Banc of America Securities: Just quickly, I was curious where you are in terms of the 300 millimeter mix for your memory products and where you expect to be by the end of the year, a percent? 
Steven R. Appleton: Basically, in terms of core DRAM, we have two facilities that run the bulk of that, and that is MTV in Virginia and it is our Singapore fab. Virginia basically is full up now. It has been 100% converted, and I think Mark told me earlier today it is 100% converted to 78 nanometer technology as well. Then, we are also in the process of moving our tech joint venture from 200 millimeter to 300 millimeter with a process shrink in it as well, and that will be largely finished about over the next year. 
Mark Fitzgerald - Banc of America Securities: So in 12 months, you will basically have 100%, or close to 100% of memory on 300 millimeter? 
Steven R. Appleton: For the core DRAM, I think it is fair to say that we will be pushing that kind of number. Obviously some of the specialty and legacy products will stay behind on some of the older technologies. 
Mark Fitzgerald - Banc of America Securities: Is that what drives the CapEx declines next year? Basically, you are through the 300 millimeter transition? 
Steven R. Appleton: Partly, yes. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Manish Goyal of CREF Investments. 
Manish Goyal - CREF Investments: My questions have been asked. It would be helpful if you can give some sense for what [depreciation] may look like for fiscal ’08. 
Wilbur G. Stover: First, Manish, ’07 probably runs $1.9 billion and ’08 with the incremental capital we have deployed should be at 2.2. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Tim Luke of Lehman Brothers. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers: I was wondering if you could give some color on how you perceive the cost reductions in the DRAM area going forward. 
Steven R. Appleton: If we look at just core DRAM, we will be low double digits. If you average everything, it will be high single digits to low double digits, quarter to quarter. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers: Thank you. Also, I was just wondering if you can recap your comments with respect to the NAND roadmap in terms of 70 and 50, and how you perceive that to be positioning you guys versus your competitors. 
Michael W. Sadler: Well, as we look at our production today, we really are essentially 100% transitioned to the 70-nanometer node with that again dialable SLC to MLC. The 50 nanometer transition will occur throughout the second half of 2007 and into 2008, and on a relative competitive positioning on that, we feel our timing is approximately equivalent to the two leading competitors in the space but we think we are going to have somewhat of a die size advantage relative to them. We believe their nodes, 56 nanometers versus 54. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Alex Gauna of UBS. 
Alex Gauna - UBS: To follow through on that comment on the NAND side, we have been hearing that maybe there are some yield issues with some of your competitors at the 56 nanometer node. Are you hearing the same thing and does that make you nervous with even your own 50 nanometer process in terms of hitting your yield targets on that? 
Steven R. Appleton: No, really not at all. I do not have much insight into how they are doing from a yield perspective. I can tell you we are very, very comfortable with how our 50 nanometer node is going.  What we have heard is that some of the competitors are having trouble with the immersion toolset and the productivity of that and defects associated with it. I can tell you we are not suffering from those problems. We are pretty comfortable with how we are going to progress. 
Alex Gauna - UBS: Is there any concern that we should have as a market that your competitors, if they are having problems with this immersion toolset, they solve it and suddenly we find ourselves seeing NAND ASPs reverse? Is there that type of worry out there? 
Steven R. Appleton: It would be speculation. I cannot answer that for you. 
Alex Gauna - UBS: Okay. You made one comment in the prepared remarks about seeing the device market respond to some elasticity demand and accelerated acceptance of NAND into mobile video devices. Can you give us some examples about what exactly you are seeing, what you were referring to, or maybe what timetables you are referring to? 
Michael W. Sadler: I referred to two application areas in particular. One is in the personal video player space in terms of deploying flash as a storage medium. I believe we are going to see meaningful market impact in the second half of the calendar year. On the solid state disk drive area, I believe that is still a 2008 type of -- maybe even the second half of 2008 until we see a meaningful impact, but several months ago we were looking at about 2009, 2010 in terms of that being a real significant demand driver. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Krishna Shankar of JMP Securities. 
Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities: What is your revenue mix by product line, CMOS image sensors, NAND, PC and specialty DRAM? 
Steven R. Appleton: We ran approximately 50% in core DRAM, approximately high teens in specialty DRAM, high teens in flash, and as Mike mentioned earlier, about 11% in image sensors. 
Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities: Could you comment on whether you had positive gross margins in the NAND flash area this quarter? 
Steven R. Appleton: No, we did not. 
Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities: Do you expect to get there in Q3? 
Steven R. Appleton: We are not going to guide to that. Sorry, but what we are trying to do is provide you some market intelligence and then you can couple that with your own ASP assumptions along with our guidance. The cost reductions will continue to average 20% a quarter. 
Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities: My final question is what do you see as the initial demand profile of customer acceptance on Windows Vista in the consumer channel, where it has been marketed first? 
Michael W. Sadler: It’s great. I think, if I’m not mistaken, I just saw some data out from Microsoft a couple of days ago that the take rate on Vista in the consumer market is faster than any other OS introduction, so on the consumer side, it is great. We just have not seen any meaningful penetration in the corporate side, which as you know is the biggest single piece of the PC market. I think we are going to start to layer later in this year. If not, then in 2008.  All systems go with respect to the new OS. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Bill Dezellem of Tieton Capital Management. Sir, your line is live. 
Bill Dezellem - Tieton Capital Management: My apologies. Relative to your comments about the recent demand that you are experiencing both in NAND and DRAM, has that been strong enough that you are actually now pulling from inventory and actually selling more than you are able to produce at this point?  And then the second question is relative to cost reduction discussion. You talked a fair amount about the next quarter, the fiscal Q3. But beyond fiscal Q3, could you provide us a bit of a roadmap in terms of both the manufacturing front and the financial aspect to the cost reductions? 
Michael W. Sadler: First of all, on the NAND side with respect to the price stabilization, even the strengthening in the last couple of weeks, we went into that with virtually no NAND flash finished goods inventory. Today, we are sitting with virtually no NAND flash finished goods inventory, so no meaningful impact. I do not have any problem NAND flash. When the prices were half what they are today, it was still pretty easy to sell. Today, it is still the fact so not really a significant change in the profile of our finished goods inventory on NAND flash.  In DRAM, this price stabilization is really literally just days old now and we have not seen a meaningful impact on our finished goods inventory. 
Steven R. Appleton: I am not sure I understood what you were asking in that second question. Can you maybe phrase it slightly different? 
Bill Dezellem - Tieton Capital Management: Sure. You have discussed that DRAM cost reductions on the core DRAM front here in the fiscal Q3, we can look for low double digits and the NAND, due to the Lehigh ramp, is essentially going to be flat from a financial perspective. I actually would like to move beyond this quarter and get a perspective into the Q4 and fiscal Q1 in terms of what you will be doing in the manufacturing plants that will be bringing costs down and what the financial impact is anticipated to be in those quarters. Could you give us a little further vision rather than what is going to be happening immediately in front of us? 
Steven R. Appleton: To the extent that I can comment on what happens downstream after the quarter that we are in, as already had been noted, we think it goes flat because we are in a ramp period and we have to shift the product an R&D expense, so to speak, over to a cogs number, but you should expect us to get back on the curve and in fact in NAND, probably reaccelerate as the 50 nanometer takes hold, as Mark described.  So on the DRAM side, we will certainly start coming back down that curve in the quarter after the one that we are in, and then on the NAND side, we think it will probably accelerate.  Your comments are noted in terms of what happens beyond that but it is hard for us to know exactly what that reduction will be, but again I think it is going to be pretty significant given the profile that we are on for -- not only, by the way, the advantage that we think we have now with the 6F squared device on 78 nanometer but also with the success that we have had, the earlier success on the 50 nanometer on the NAND. We think it looks pretty good after that. 
Bill Dezellem - Tieton Capital Management: I am not sure how to ask this next question but if you compare the current production costs versus the costs that flowed through the P&L in the fiscal Q2, what is the delta there? Basically, we are trying to understand the impact, what will happen, just as time progresses and product gets out of inventory. 
Steven R. Appleton: Bill, that is a little bit too detailed for us to get into. We try to answer that for you by giving you comps quarter to quarter, and so your answer is partly in light of the fact that we are talking about double digit cost declines for DRAM and over 20% quarter to quarter on NAND. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Gus Richards of First Albany Capital. 
Gus Richards - First Albany Capital: Yes, quickly, on the 50 nanometer NAND process, how many layers do you need advance of lithography? I have a follow-up. 
Mark Durcan: You know, I think we are going to try to keep that one to ourselves for now and let our competition guess. 
Gus Richards - First Albany Capital: Okay, and the follow-up is, given that you are not having problems with immersion, is it safe to assume you are not using it? 
Mark Durcan: I would not say that is safe to assume and again, we are going to keep our technology pretty close to the vest and let everyone else figure that out. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Edwin Mok of Needham & Company. 
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company: Just a question on the demand side. You guys mentioned that DRAM, it looks like demand is stabilizing, customers are taking more orders. Are you seeing that more for desktop notebooks or are you seeing that more on the server side? 
Michael W. Sadler: Server side has actually been pretty stable throughout the turmoil, if you will, over the last couple of months. The revival if you will, or the willingness to take on more deliveries has been on both the desktop and the notebook side. It is difficult for me to distinguish between the two. 
Kipp A. Bedard: Is that it? 
Operator: There appears to be no further questions, sir. 
Kipp A. Bedard: Great. Thank you very much. We would like to thank everyone for participating on the call today. If you please bear with me, I need to repeat the Safe Harbor protection language.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Lindsay and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the fourth quarter fiscal year and financial release conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker’s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.  (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Kipp Bedard, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin your conference. 
Kipp Bedard: Thank you, Lindsay. I would like to welcome everyone to Micron Technology’s fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year-end 2006 financial release conference call.  On the call today remotely is Mr. Steve Appleton, Chairman, CEO, and President. With me here in Boise is Mr. Mark Durcan, Chief Operating Officer; Bill Stover, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Sadler, Vice President of Worldwide Sales.  This conference call, including audio and slides, is also available on Micron’s website at micron.com. If you have not had an opportunity to review the fourth quarter 2006 financial press release, it is also available on our website at micron.com.  Our call will be approximately 60 minutes in length. There will be a taped audio replay of this call available later this evening at 5:30 p.m. Mountain time. You may reach that by dialing 973-341-3080, with a confirmation code of 7930225. This replay will run through Thursday, October 12, 2006, at 5:30 p.m. Mountain time. A webcast replay will be available on the company’s website until October 5, 2007. We encourage you to monitor our website at micron.com throughout the quarter for the most current information on the company, including information on the various financial conferences that we will be attending.  During the course of this call, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company and the industry. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to the documents the company files on a consolidated basis from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, specifically the company’s most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.  These documents contain and identify important factors that could cause the actual results for the company on a consolidated basis to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements. These certain factors can be found on the company’s website. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievement. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the day of the presentation to conform these statements to actual results.  With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Stover. 
Bill Stover: Thanks, Kipp. The results we will be going over, just for confirmation, are the consolidated results, including our IM Flash technologies joint venture with Intel, our TECH Semiconductor joint venture wafer fab in Singapore, and Lexar Media for the nine-week period subsequent to our acquisition of Lexar.  For those listeners who may not yet have access to our press release, let me go over summary financial results for the fiscal year and fourth quarter, which ended August 31st. For the fiscal year, net sales totaled $5.3 billion. That is the second-highest total in our company history, and the company recorded net income of $408 million, or $0.57 per diluted share. We are certainly pleased with the third consecutive year of increasing net income.  The major themes benefiting this year’s results are: As was mentioned on our second quarter conference call, operating income in 2006 benefited from the technology sale to Intel, which realized $230 million for the company.  For the fourth quarter, net sales totaled $1.37 billion and net income was $64 million, or $0.08 per diluted share. You will notice that the fourth quarter results reflect a $24 million amount, or $0.03 per diluted share, with a non-controlling interest in TECH Semiconductor. The product mix, which TECH runs, has been primarily PC DRAM devices, which have enjoyed favourable market conditions recently. The non-controlling interest line reflects 57% of TECH’s profitability for the quarter.  Gross margin for the year came in at 23%. As we noted in our press release, the fourth quarter gross margin was impacted by legal settlement costs. Absent the effects of the settlements, gross margin would have been approximately 3 percentage points higher for the fourth quarter, a slightly higher level than the third quarter, primarily on improved PC DRAM margins.  With regard to the legal settlements, I want to acknowledge that the $45 million amount includes our previously announced Tessera agreement, and the remainder all relate to contingency matters previously disclosed within the company’s filings. As these are active matters, there is no further detail that we can provide.  Selling, general and administrative expenses in most regards have increased proportional to the activities associated with IM Flash, TECH Semiconductor, and Lexar. Lexar itself is a step function increase of about $20 million per quarter.  Additionally, the fourth quarter of 2006 incurred a heavier-than-normal legal cost. We expect the quarterly run-rate in ’07 to approximate $140 million.  Stock related non-cash expenses totalled $26 million in 2006, of which approximately $11 million are reflected in SG&A. Total stock related non-cash expenses in 2007 are expected to approximately double the 2006 amount.  Unlike SG&A, which grew consistent with an increasing scale of operations, R&D expense stayed quite flat, even while the scope of R&D activities increased quite significantly. The strategic move to partner with Intel for NAND development has been noticeably beneficial in containing R&D expense. We expect R&D to run at approximately $175 million per quarter in 2007.  It was a very strong year for the company in generating cash flow from operations in excess of $2 billion. The improvement over 2005 reflects our successful diversification into specialty DRAM and CMOS image sensors, and the alliance’s we struck in the year.  Capital spending for 2006 came in at about $1.6 billion. Our forecast for capital spending in 2007 is $4 billion. That appears to be an increase from our last forecast for 2007, but merely reflects that 2006 came in under our last estimate. Approximately $1.5 billion of that 2007 capital spending total is expected to come from partner contributions.  The second half of fiscal 2007 will really be the first period to see the noticeable benefits of increased volume coming from Manassas and Lehi ramps associated with our capital spend.  The size and scope of our operations expanded greatly in 2006 as we positioned the company for market opportunities in NAND and capitalized on our industry-leading position in CMOS image sensors.  Cash and investment balances increased $1.8 billion to $3.1 billion at year-end. Total debt declined to less than $600 million.  The growth across the balance sheet is reflective of the consolidation of IM Flash, TECH Semiconductor, and Lexar. The approximate $890 million purchase price for Lexar was allocated over the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and resulted in the recognition of approximately $490 million of good will.  I will close there and turn our commentary over to Mike. 
Mike Sadler: Thanks, Bill. We could not ask for much more with respect to the strength of demand in the mobile communications, consumer electronics, and computing markets. These markets account for the vast majority of demand for Micron semiconductor memory and imaging products. As our customers roll into their peak selling season for cellular phones, digital TV’s and personal computers, we are braced for even stronger demand as we move through our fiscal Q1.  We have spoken extensively about our strategy to continue broadening the product portfolio and create exposure in a variety of markets. This strategy is playing out nicely as we make further in-roads into these newer markets.  We have made a conscious effort to reduce exposure in the desktop and notebook markets with our commodity DRAM offering. This journey continues, but by no means are we withdrawing from these markets, as they continue to be the single largest consumers of DRAM. At this point in time, it is gratifying to see the market performing so well in terms of DRAM consumption, particularly when many industry experts were predicting a sluggish environment due to Vista operating system rollout delays from this year to next.  DDR2 is now entrenched as the mainstream memory solution for the PC market. With strong demand, we have seen average selling prices increase over 20% from the low- to mid-summer. Prices are continuing to rise in the near-term and we are optimistic that this environment will sustain right into what is expected to be one of next year’s major demand catalysts, the Vista operating system.  The minimum effective DRAM configuration for Vista will be 1-gigabyte, with optimal performance in most applications achieved at 2- to 4-gigabytes. This represents a significant step up in memory content, with typical PCs today configured with about 800-megabytes.  The server market is at the heart of our DRAM strategy, and we are holding a leadership position with a full line of high-density chips and modules. We are not sitting still here, as evidenced by our continued early enablement of fully buffered DIMs and the recent introduction of the world’s first 1-gigabit DDR3 component.  In the current quarter, we are commencing volume production of our mainstream 1-gigabit DDR2 components on 78-nanometer technology in the Virginia plant. This is the DRAM industry’s smallest 1-gigabit die and the best cost performance solution in the market for high density applications.  We have seen an acceleration in NAND flash demand over the past 60 days. Portable audio players are a primary driver, and as we all know, there is a seasonal aspect to the timing of consumer electronic demand in any given calendar year. NAND pricing has been on a rollercoaster this year and the recent trend has resulted in about a 30% average selling price bounce off the bottom as seen earlier this summer. Beyond Christmas season, I would not be surprised to see things slow down and we may see price pressure again in the early part of next year.  Over the intermediate to long-term, we are bullish on the demand for NAND, particularly for the mobile phone and personal computer segments. These markets are negligible drivers of today’s demand, and markets in which Micron is deeply entrenched with our complementary products in our portfolio. To that end, we are aggressively deploying new capital and advanced technology to extend our NAND flash market presence over the course of the next couple of years.  The mobile phone space has been the primary demand driver for our explosive image sensor business over the past couple of years. Our mobile phone imaging business had another quarter of growth, with high pixel density imagers of 1-megapixel and greater now accounting for well over one-half of our imager revenues. We believe this is a good indicator validating Micron’s position as the recognized leader in image quality and in CMOS imaging technology.  In addition to imagers, the current offering of low-powered DRAM and cellular RAM are vital pieces of our mobile phone success. With these products, we believe that today’s mobile memory architecture has legs well into the future, with the markets eventually migrating to a NAND plus low-powered DRAM architecture. As one of only a few manufacturers with the capability to develop and manufacture these fully integrated solutions, our value proposition to the handset makers increases as this evolution continues. We are helping our customers succeed as opposed to competing with them and believe that this is a significant differentiator for the company.  We could not be more pleased with our position in the mobile phone value chain, given Micron’s technology and product portfolio.  I will also point out that our fiscal Q1 will be the first opportunity to fully incorporate Lexar’s products and markets into the mix. With over 70,000 retail outlets, top performing products and leading controller technology and intellectual property, we are excited for the prospects of this new segment in both the retail space as well as placement with our OEM customer base.  To wrap things up, from my perspective, everywhere I look in the market I see robust demand for Micron products in all end markets. Our near-term efforts are focused on balancing product mix supply and allocations to optimize customer satisfaction and profitability.  Our intermediate to longer-term efforts are focused on technology development and capacity expansion to bring even more value to the customer base. As always, we appreciate your continued support and interest in the company.  I will turn it back over to Kipp. 
Kipp Bedard: Thank you, Mike. With that, we would like to take questions from callers. Just a reminder, if you are using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset when asking a question so that we can hear you clearly.  With that, please open up the phone line. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question is coming from Glen Yeung from Citigroup. You may go ahead. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup: Thank you. Just a couple of questions. First one is if you look at gross margins in the quarter, up slightly from the previous quarter, particularly if we take out the charges. Can you talk about, as we look into the November quarter, how that gross margin may trend? What I am specifically looking for is, are there changes in how you are going to break down your wafer starts to optimize gross margins for the next quarter?
Kipp Bedard: Let me break that up into a couple of questions, Glen. I think we will start with Mark and he can address some of the costs programs we have in play for next quarter and throughout the year, and then we will hand over the second part of that over to Mike to address perhaps what his expectations are for pricing. Mark. 
Mark Durcan: Thanks, Glen. On the cost front, for DRAM, we see relatively flat bit growth over the next couple of quarters, but should see that accelerate towards the second half of the year, driving some significant cost reductions in the core DRAM arena, maybe in the 30% to 40% regime.  As we look at NAND, obviously we are pretty early into our NAND ramp, and while we are pretty pleased with the way the technology is levelling out, we expect that it is going to take another few quarters before we really start to see the benefit of the capacity we are putting in place. So strong bit growth throughout the year, leading to significant cost reductions throughout the year, that we will realize a much better position as we roll late into the fiscal year. 
Mike Sadler: On the product mix front, Glen, if you look at our DRAM portfolio, we have a pretty stable platform of business in the synchronous DRAM area and in the mobile DRAM and cellular RAM products for mobile phones, industrial equipment, networking products and so forth, and that business is highly predictable, so generally speaking, that business is going to be stable to slightly up as we roll into Q1 and into Q2.  The real challenge for us from a mix standpoint in the short-term is on what we call the commodity DRAM front, and that is targeting the proper mix of DDR versus DDR2. There are a variety of transitions going on in the marketplace in the computing area that are driving DDR to DDR2 to transitions from a demand standpoint, and of course the pricing is bouncing around. It has been quite active, actually, in the last month or so, and it looks like it is probably going to continue to be, certainly for the rest of the calendar year.  So what we are trying to do there is optimize both customer satisfaction and probability, and the bias at this point is probably towards a richer mix of DDR2 versus DDR, which is a little bit different than has been the case looking backward over the past couple of quarters. 
Glen Yeung - Citigroup: Maybe just a follow-up to your comment. Could you comment a little bit on what you see in the next quarter for image sensors, and also what you think PC demand is going to look like in the fourth quarter, largely because we are in front of Vista, do you see any air pockets in the fourth quarter?
Kipp Bedard: Glen, we are having a little bit of a problem hearing you. Are you asking for Mike’s interpretation of the image sensor business in Q1?
Glen Yeung - Citigroup: Yes, and then also, any thoughts on PC demand trends for the November quarter, given we are one quarter ahead of Vista. 
Mike Sadler: First of all, on the image sensor front, we are continuing to have a richer mix of -- I will call them high pixel density imagers in the mobile phone space. I mentioned that over half our business in Q4, in our Q4, was for 1-megapixel and greater sensors. Actually, what we are heading towards, the 2-megapixel sensor really being the sweet spot sensor for -- I will call it the mid-range mobile phones, and we are continuing to grow our high pixel density chips as a percentage of our overall revenue.  The EGA for us is still pretty substantial, but now it is in the neighbourhood of a quarter of our business, and most of the growth for us really is occurring in 2- and 3- and even 5-megapixels area.  On the PC DRAM demand front, things are on fire right now. We cannot even come close to meeting the needs of our customers. The real hot product today is DDR2 and I presume that is primarily tied towards consumer demand for both desktop and notebook PCs, so if there was any concern or worry about a lull or a lag in PC demand leading into the Vista introductions next year, it is not happening -- at least, it is not happening from our view.  Things are really looking positive on the PC front for us. When we get beyond the hot seasonal season, in the January-February timeframe, our expectations and our customer’s expectations are that the Vista intro is going to be a real good demand kicker for them, for system shipments for us, both for system demand as well as a big boost in terms of memory content, so we are quite bullish on the prospects for our DRAM business in the computing environment. 
Operator: Your next question is coming from Mike Masdea from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.
Mike Masdea - Credit Suisse: Thanks a lot. You gave some commentary on the profitability in the DRAM side. Could you help us out a little bit, at least directionally, what is going on in the CMOS and NAND side?
Kipp Bedard: Mike, is that again from a cost perspective, market perspective?
Mike Masdea - Credit Suisse: Gross margin perspective, kind of overall. So were you able to, given the mix comments that you had and also given that you are covering more of your fixed costs on the NAND side, are you able to improve your profitability in both those, or were you able to improve your profitability in both those segments?
Mark Durcan: Let me take the NAND piece of that. Clearly we are still building out our NAND product portfolio, so if you look at where we are today profitability wise, we are underwater. Now, as we move throughout the year and richen up the product mix, move more and more of our products into SLC, from SLC into MLC, we will see some significant improvement there.  We are also putting a lot of new capital in place, and generally there is a lag as you bring that new capital online and then try and get it fully utilized. We are anticipating, as I said earlier, we are anticipating 50% bit growth quarter over quarter as we move through the year, and we should see significant cost reductions associated with that growing bit production. 
Mike Sadler: With regard to the imaging business, we have been very pleased with that performance in the fourth quarter. ASPs on average were actually up slightly and margins up slightly, so we are very pleased with that position. 
Mike Masdea - Credit Suisse: Just to follow-up on the comments for the NAND side, my understanding is that it has gotten a little bit worse first and then it is going to start to get better, now that you have the mix starting to get a little bit better and you have the volumes starting to get better?
Mark Durcan: It is definitely true we are not where we want to be, cost-wise, on NAND today and that is going to get better as we move through the year. 
Mike Masdea - Credit Suisse: Then, your commentary on inventory, both from what you guys are doing with your own inventories, which I think were up a little bit this quarter and then what you are seeing out there in the industry. 
Mike Sadler: Our inventory balance, quarter over quarter, we were up in terms of total megabits in finished goods inventory. That was really isolated to our cellular RAM products, which are our mobile phone memory products, and I would attribute that to some inventory accumulation on the part of our customers. We were up on Flash megabits as well, in terms of what you would think of as our traditional DRAM product portfolio, pretty flat quarter over quarter, and it is basically hand-to-mouth today.  We still do have some inventory on the cellular RAM and we are working through the inventory on the Flash. Anyway, I do not think nothing too much to be concerned about.  Based on the -- I will call it the emotion in some of the phone calls that we are having with customers today, particularly on the PC DRAM front, I think it is pretty safe to say that there is no inventory out there at all. 
Mike Masdea - Credit Suisse: Just to follow-up that one real quick, given the money out there on the table potentially, given that market is pretty healthy right now, any kind of change in view? I know you said you were going to hold bits flattish, but any opportunistic potential out there to make the customers happy and take a little bit of money in the short-term?
Mike Sadler: With respect to our strategy, which is to strengthen our position in the high-end competing space, specifically servers, we are not deviating from that at all. We are not deviating at all in terms of continuing our Flash ramp and so forth.  Now, with respect to what we do with some of those commodity DRAM chips, they are suitable for desktop and notebook applications to try and take advantage of the opportunities we have -- absolutely no question we are trying to push things as hard as we possibly can to increase prices and still support the same customers that we are working with.  We can be as opportunistic as anybody else, and we are trying to do the best we can with that commodity DRAM portfolio. 
Mike Masdea - Credit Suisse: Got it, very helpful, thanks, guys. 
Kipp Bedard: Thanks, Michael. Next question, please. 
Operator: Your next question is coming from Shawn Webster from JP Morgan. You may go ahead.
Shawn Webster - JP Morgan: Good afternoon. Could you talk a little bit on the gross margins and the $45 million impact? I could not quite tell from your commentary, is that a one-time event or are you expecting other things in the future? Then I have a follow-up, please. 
Bill Stover : Yes, the item that we are speaking to there in the fourth quarter included $28 million Tessera agreement that we reached and we previously announced. The other items, as we have indicated, settlement of legal matters, as a general rule, we do not anticipate those to be recurring. We deal with them case by case. 
Shawn Webster - JP Morgan: Thank you. Turning to the demand environment, can you give us your bit consumption expectations for the end market for PCs in Q4, calendar Q4?
Mike Sadler: Sure, I would be happy to. A cross section of our big consumers, which you can imagine are pretty good proxies for the overall industry, bit consumption up about 12% to 15% quarter over quarter, calendar Q4 versus calendar Q3. On a year-over-year basis, Q4 versus Q4 of ’05, up about 60%. 
Shawn Webster - JP Morgan: Is that normal seasonal for you guys in terms of bit demand?
Mike Sadler: Normal seasonal in Q4 would probably be on the lower end of that, maybe 10% to 12%, so it is slightly higher than normal seasonal. 
Shawn Webster - JP Morgan: Can you tell us what your DRAM bit shipments and ASPs did quarter over quarter in August?
Kipp Bedard: We can tell you that the bit shipments were up low-single digits, and for ASPs, I believe we were -- go ahead, Mike. 
Mike Sadler: ASPs I believe quarter over quarter were relatively flat on the DRAM. 
Shawn Webster - JP Morgan: Flat quarter over quarter?
Mike Sadler: Yes, yes. 
Shawn Webster - JP Morgan: If pricing stays flat where it is now, where do you think your average pricing could land in November for DRAM?
Mike Sadler: They will be up for sure, and I would just have to say single digits at this point, based on our visibility. 
Shawn Webster - JP Morgan: Thank you very much. 
Operator: Your next question is coming from Joseph Osha from Merrill Lynch. You may go ahead. 
Joseph Osha - Merrill Lynch: As I understand it, if we back out the NAND Flash and we back out Lexar, the DRAM gross margins, on an apples-to-apples basis, would have been up slightly, is that what you said?
Kipp Bedard: That is correct, Joe. 
Joseph Osha - Merrill Lynch: Is that -- again, if I go back, this is, I think for most of us, the best DRAM operating environment we have seen in several years. Is that, by my estimation, very small improvement in gross margins driven by the fact that you are sort of mix limited and you are limited in terms of what you can do out of your 200 mil facilities because you are supporting IMFT, or what is the story here?
Kipp Bedard: Keep in mind two things, Joe. One is that the price increases we actually saw that benefited us in the quarter came substantially in the last month, and so at most, a third of the sales. Secondly, do not forget the $45 million that Bill referenced as a cost of goods sold cost that came in during the quarter. 
Joseph Osha - Merrill Lynch: I can see that, but if you go back, the last time you had a DRAM business that was generating at one point 40% gross margins, and even in the November ’04 quarter, 34% gross margins, so I guess I am a little flummoxed as to how the DRAM margins seems stalled here in the mid- to high-20s, despite this extraordinarily good operating environment. 
Kipp Bedard: I think again one other piece that Mark mentioned earlier, just to reiterate, is that we have put a lot of costs in place to date in building our businesses and we are on the early phase of wafer output. As you can appreciate, pretty substantial wafer increases helps drive the fixed portion of that overhead cost that gets allocated on a wafer basis lower quite quickly. As Mark mentioned earlier, we have a pretty good cost reduction profile heading in front of us here. 
Joseph Osha - Merrill Lynch: So let me ask you then, and I am not going to -- obviously I know you are not going to call pricing, so I will do it for you. If pricing were to stay where it is now for the remainder of the quarter, which I believe implied a mid-single-digit sequential increase per your previous comment, can you get your DRAM gross margins to improve?
Kipp Bedard: Definitely. As Mike mentioned, we have ASPs would be up high-single digits if they were flat from here, and as Mark mentioned, we are going to get increasingly positive cost reduction, so that equates to margin expansion, you bet. 
Operator: Your next question is coming from Tim Luke from Lehman Brothers. You may go ahead. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers: I was wondering if you could give us a feel for how big a piece of the revenue the NAND portion may have been in the August period, and then going forward, it sounded from your commentary that we would wait until the middle of calendar ’07 before we move into profitability in the NAND arena, or how should we view that kind of time as the transition?
Bill Stover : With regard to the first part of the question, the NAND represented 9% of revenues in the fourth quarter. We also indicated that there is a quite limited amount of Lexar NAND revenue that was able to be recognized as the product that was in the channel, by way of the purchase accounting, did not allow us to pick up the revenue associated with those final sales.  If you look at Q1 and estimate approximately $160 million of NAND Lexar related sales, that is a fairly significant increase for the quarter. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers: Would the incremental ramp also boast non-Lexar related NAND?
Kipp Bedard: I am sorry, could you repeat that for me?
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers: You will get a boost of $160 million associated with Lexar, and then you will have a further mix increase in NAND on top of that?
Bill Stover : Without trying to call the ASPs, the bits grew over 50% last quarter. They are going to grow 50% quarter over quarter this quarter. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers: With respect to your expense structure, how should we think about that developing, going forward? It looked like your SG&A was somewhat higher than one might have modeled this quarter in August. 
Kipp Bedard: I think as Bill mentioned in his comments, you should model SG&A 170 to 175 range, or excuse me, R&D 170 to 175 range and the SG&A I believed he mentioned the 140 to 150 range. 
Bill Stover : But the 140 looks like where it is going to run for quarters in ’07. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers: Do you think this other income level of around the 15 level, down from sort of 50 in the prior quarter, is where it is likely to be through count fiscal ’07, or how should we think about that?
Bill Stover : I am sorry. If your reference is to net interest income -- 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers: Yes, right, sorry. 
Bill Stover : It will range between $15 million and $30 million for quarter over ’07, with it being at the higher end during the early quarters by way of the cash balances which we are maintaining right now, and with our capital spending profile, that will come down over the year.  I would also acknowledge that $140 million estimate on the SG&A, until we have the opportunity, which is really a six- to nine-month period of integrating Lexar, we really do not have an opportunity to strip much cost out of where there may be some duplications, but about six months from now, we will get on Micron systems and we will have an opportunity to do some reduction of costs. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers: Let me just get back to the question with respect to the timeline for the transition towards profitability in NAND, if there is any flavour or color there about what sort of timeline we should be thinking about. 
Kipp Bedard: Not really, Tim. One of the reasons we are doing that is we are going to stay away from trying to predict ASPs for you. We know, as Mark stated, we have a very substantial second half fiscal ’07 continuing through second half calendar ’07 cost reduction profile. We have talked in prior analysts meetings of we expect nothing short of 60% to 80% cost reductions throughout the fiscal year. We are going to leave it to you to determine what you believe the ASPs will be, and when you think those two lines intersect, that is when we will get there. 
Tim Luke - Lehman Brothers: But your status is really the second half of the fiscal year in terms of seeing the cost reductions?
Kipp Bedard: Well, the more significant ones, but obviously if we are increasing bits quarter to quarter 50%, you are seeing pretty substantial cost reductions right now, especially when layered on the fact that the fixed overhead cost of adding additional wafers and equipment is there, and the wafers are just now starting to come out of fabs in an increasing way. 
Operator: Your next question is coming from Gus Richards from First Albany Capital. You may go ahead.
Gus Richard - First Albany Capital: When you mentioned that the sequential bit consumptions will be up 12% to 15%, a little bit above normal seasonal trends, is the increase coming from box loading or strong unit demand?
Mike Sadler: I do not know, to be honest with you. I would speculate it is probably coming more from unit demand than box loading, given where we are in the season, but we have not dissected granularity of the demand, to be honest with you. 
Gus Richard - First Albany Capital: Essentially, you are looking at 60% year over year growth Q4 to Q4, isn’t that an acceleration of bit consumption?
Mike Sadler: 60% year over year Q4 versus Q4 would be an acceleration of bit consumption. That is correct. What we model in, and I believe what in general the industry has modeled in for DRAM demand growth from the computing environment, it is somewhere in the range of 40% to 50%, so yes, things are -- the numbers would suggest that things are hotter than what had been expected, and I can tell you that the environment feels that way as well. 
Operator: Your next question is coming from Titus Menzies from Jefferies and Company. You may go ahead.
Titus Menzies - Jefferies & Co.: If I can ask maybe just two questions. Firstly, you guys seem very upbeat about your CMOS sensor business. Can you give some visibility as to where you see the overall handset markets panning out over the next three to six months? 
Mike Sadler: I will give you my view on that, with the caveat that we are a semiconductor maker, not a handset maker, so I can only tell you through what we are seeing from our customers. I will have to turn the clock back a couple months ago. I mentioned that we had accumulated some cellular RAM inventory, which is really a component that almost goes exclusively into cell phones. We had also accumulated some VGA sensor inventory at about the same time. Subsequently, in the past 30 days or so, we have seen a resurgence in demand for those components, which has resulted in some liquidation of the inventory that we had accumulated on both the cellular ram, but in particular on the VGA sensors. I interpret that as though our customers have worked off some of the inventory that they were sitting on.  Now, so my take is essentially with respect to our component feeds into the cell phone market were relatively flush in terms of inventory. I do not know what really that means for the future. If we take our customers’ forecasts for the next couple of months, which we always take with a grain of salt, it would suggest a pretty robust environment running all the way through the first part of next year.  To summarize and boil things down, I think things have strengthened substantially in the past couple of months from where they were say in the August timeframe. At least from an inventory standpoint, I would think that a lot of the inventory that was in the channel has been digested. 
Titus Menzies - Jefferies & Co.: The second one is about the cap-ex. Of the $2.5 billion which is coming from Micron itself, where do we split out between in ’07?
Bill Stover : If your question is -- we gave an indication of $4 billion cap-ex for 2007. You can look at that as a bit more than half of that going into the IMFT operations, and if you take the balance and split it about 50-50 between the TECH Semiconductor Singapore joint venture and the balance of the Micron historical operations. 
Titus Menzies - Jefferies & Co.: Last question, in terms of the contract price. I know you mentioned about how robust pricing has been to date, but in terms of contract pricing going forward, can you give us some feel as to what you are seeing from your customers right now?
Mike Sadler: I presume you are talking about DRAM pricing in the computing environment?
Titus Menzies - Jefferies & Co.: Exactly. 
Mike Sadler: We just went through the first half of October pricing and we were successful in a 3% to 5% average selling price increase on DDR2. I cannot imagine we are looking at anything other than price increases, certainly next time around, just based on how strong the demand is. It is a multiple of our ability to supply right now, so the environment is such that price increases are pretty much locked in, certainly for next time around, anyway. 
Operator: Your next question is coming from Bill Dezellem from Tieton Capital Management. You may go ahead. 
Bill Dezellem - Tieton Capital Management: Thank you. We had a couple of questions. First of all, coming back to the Flash business, and if we simply assume that prices are flat, given that it does affect profitability, would it be reasonable to assume that the losses in that business on a dollar basis, not margins, but absolute dollars, would decline in Q1, and then, versus Q4, it would decline further in Q2 versus Q1, et cetera as you roll through the fiscal year?
Mike Sadler: I think, Bill, you need to be looking at it as a bit more flat early in the year and a greater change throughout the second half. 
Bill Dezellem - Tieton Capital Management: Thank you. That is helpful. Then, relative to Lexar, you had mentioned that there will be an incremental $160 million of revenues in the Q1 versus the Q4. Would it be fair to say that $160 million of it was the sales level in the fourth quarter that was not recognized, or are you adding on at some number to what was not recognized in the Q1 for the normal seasonal pick-up?
Mike Sadler: Lexar has been able to re-engage with a number of customers by way of them being quite receptive to the broad portfolio that Micron offers, but we are not taking a particularly optimistic view yet of first quarter growth. That level is really reflective of what they have been able to do in recent periods. 
Bill Dezellem - Tieton Capital Management: So, said another way, in the fourth quarter, there were roughly $160 million of sales that Lexar, or the old Lexar, experienced but, due to the way the accounting works, simply were not recognized on the sales line?
Mike Sadler: Bill, I did not go back and specifically check what they had done prior to our acquisition. This period is a little bit of a seasonal up-tick, so I would expect that they had slightly less than that in that prior period. 
Bill Dezellem - Tieton Capital Management: Thank you. That is helpful. One final question, relative to the Toshiba $288 million settlement. Would you walk us through number one, how the cash is anticipated to come in, and then number two, how the accounting will work for that, if it is any different than the recognition in line with the cash being received?
Kipp Bedard: Bill, I can take the first part of that on how we expect the cash received. We were very specific in the press release to say over multiple years. We just cannot go into anymore detail. I will let Bill handle the accounting approach to it. 
Bill Stover : The $288 million, the vast majority of that is actually recognized in the purchase accounting for Lexar, so when we get the 10-Q on file, you will see an increase in receivables, which is reflective of the vast majority of that amount. As that transaction settled a number of matters that Lexar had pre-existing to our acquisition, the accounting dictates that treatment. Certainly we are very, very pleased with the negotiations there and it is reflective of the combination of Micron and Lexar and the strength that we brought to those negotiations. Steve may want to comment to that. 
Steven Appleton: Let me just say that there was a lot of anticipation, I think, in the Lexar litigation as they were going through it, but we really have a lot different relationship with Toshiba. I think the agreement that we struck we thought was pretty good. It is, as Bill mentioned, whether it is fortunate or unfortunate, I do not know, but it ends up, because of the proximity to the acquisition of Lexar and because of some of it being attributable to something that was historical, it all got wrapped up and simply flows to purchase accounting. It will not flow through the P&L. We still, of course, get the cash but it will not flow through the P&L. 
Bill Dezellem - Tieton Capital Management: That is helpful, and I apologize for taking so much time, but as you look back on the negotiations, were there additional benefits above and beyond simply the settlement of the litigation in terms of future collaboration in any way, shape or form, the two companies, that is noteworthy?
Steven Appleton: As you might imagine, there is a lot of strict confidentiality around the agreement, so I cannot really comment on that, other than to say we had a pretty good relationship with Toshiba historically and expect to have a good one going forward. 
Bill Dezellem - Tieton Capital Management: Thank you all. 
Kipp Bedard: Thanks, Bill. Next question, please. 
Operator: Your next question is coming from David Wong from A.G. Edwards. You may go ahead. 
David Wong - A.G. Edwards & Sons: Thank you very much. Can you give us some idea of the relative gross margins of your different product lines -- DRAM, sensors, and then the NAND flash itself by Micron, not the half that is sold to Intel at half cost.
Mike Sadler: Sure. The rating has not changed much. We still -- gross margins are still the highest on image sensors, which you will see when we report our financials on the 10-K, that we are about 42%. Specialty DRAM was closely behind that. Core DRAM as we call it, was fairly close to the printed averages, and of course, if you did the calculations, as Mark said earlier, NAND Flash, we are underwater on today. 
David Wong - A.G. Edwards & Sons: That includes NAND Flash that Micron sells, not the blended NAND Flash together with what goes to Intel, is that correct?
Mike Sadler: That is blended together. That is the way we are going to talk about these going forward, so we will report our flash business as combined. 
David Wong - A.G. Edwards & Sons: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question is coming from Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Good evening, guys, thanks so much. I have a strategy question. How do you guys think about the fact that some of the other players in the industry who are kind of further along in their diversification strategy, and I am really thinking about Samsung now, are now starting to move a little bit of capacity back from NAND to DRAM because the DRAM margins are higher than the NAND margins? So the real question is, by the time you guys get to where I am sure you are ultimately going to get to on the cost side of what you are trying to do in NAND, are there going to be any profits to be had, because there are so many competitors adding so much capacity in this thing?
Steven Appleton: First of all, I assume when you said other competitors, you mean other competitor which has the kind of portfolio that we do. I suppose you could say that Hinex has done a pretty good job too.  There tends to be an assumption out there that we have no ability to adjust our NAND capacity by virtue of a joint venture, and it is true that we do have a partner for NAND Flash and we have an obligation to ramp that product in concert with Intel, and we are doing that.  In terms of the ability to change the mix of the product, clearly we have the capability to do that, and in fact, it is probably not as widely known that we have adjusted memory wafers including NAND already to some degree to try to meet additional demands on the imaging, or things like [specialty] RAM, et cetera, so we have some flexibility but we just have to make sure that we have the cooperation of our partner.  Now, I think there is a natural mechanism that will occur when our NAND capacity gets larger, because remember, we are not producing that much NAND yet. As Mark mentioned, the Virginia facility is starting to ramp as we speak, and the Utah facility will start to ramp in the first part of the year. Those are really the first two big thrusts in terms of capacity and product portfolio that we have outside of the production that we had in the Boise facility that was previously running.  We need to get to a critical mass first before we truly start thinking about making these tradeoffs, but I wanted to point out that we will be able to make those tradeoffs, we believe, because first of all, we will have the ability to do that. There is no question that the facilities can cross over and you have something like a 90%, 95% equipment crossover. The second thing that is worth noting is when the NAND market is poor, obviously our partner will have less interest in getting a lot of it, and when the NAND market is very strong, they will have an interest in getting more of it. So there is a natural mechanism that leads us both in the right direction to utilize this significant capacity that we are putting in place. It is just that right now, we do not have that much capacity allocated around because we are in the early stages of the ramp. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: I understand the quarter to quarter nuances, and I understand the fact that we are in a ramp, and ultimately you are doing the ramp because you think NAND is going to be more profitable one day, but what happens to the extent it is not? What happens to the extent the real winners in this are the folks who are modernizing their DRAM facilities now because there is just too much competition in NAND, regardless of the great demand drivers of NAND? There is just a hell of a lot of supply out there. 
Steven Appleton: Keep in mind that we are also modernizing our DRAM facility. In fact, we think we are the first one to really ramp 78-nanometer DRAM technology right now as we speak in Virginia, and that is on 300-millimeter. TECH is starting its conversion to 300-millimeter.  Essentially, we do not really produce any -- think of it as computing DRAM or what you would think of as the high density DRAM on 200-millimeter anymore. That capacity is essentially all consumed by either specialty or imaging today, so we do not have a lot of capacity on DRAM that runs on older technology anyhow, and we too are what you call modernizing or advancing the process on 300-millimeter for the product that we do build DRAM on. There is always this question about when should Micron build the next DRAM fab, and we consistently look at that, so I wouldn’t negate that but -- and we are not ready to announce anything today, but the other thing I would point out is that the Virginia facility runs half DRAM and is ramping on now to be half and half, so that would actually be a relatively easy conversion, because it is really just in the same facility. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Perfect, that is helpful. Some other real quick questions, if I could. What should we think about depreciation being for this year, for this coming year?
Steven Appleton: Should come in about $1.6 billion. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Final question, on the Vista, you referenced it earlier as a driver, and what I was not clear on is, is that going to be a driver you think of incremental box loading or incremental box sales, if you will? I guess the -- in the industry, we have already seen the boxes pre-loaded with DRAM with the necessary DRAM considering the OEMs thought they were going to have to be Vista-enabled already?
Mike Sadler: I think the significance in terms of demand creation from Vista is probably going to be more weighted towards box-loading than system demand, and our own internal studies would indicate that the real benefits of the operating system are observed with loading of 2- to 4-gigabytes. That is a huge jump from where we are today. The industry today is at an average of about 800-megabytes.  I am not suggesting we are going to go from 800 to 2-gigabytes in the first quarter of 2007, but my point is that there are huge benefits to be derived from significant box-loading from a memory standpoint.  I think from our view, the majority of the impacts is going to be as a result of increased box-loading. Certainly there is some pent-up system demand in anticipation of the release of the OS as well. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: That generated one last question for me, then I promise I will go away. Do you think there is a change in the rule of what DRAM can represent as a total cost, as a percent of the total cost? That kind of box-loading of 2- to 4-gigs would certainly violate that rule, given how much PCs are coming now, but maybe that rule is going to change. 
Mike Sadler: I believe so, and I certainly hope so. With the prices of other components in PCs, particularly CPUs and hard disk drives under a lot of pressure and coming down, one could argue that it certainly leaves some more bill of material costs that should be, in fact, should have been allocated towards memory for the past 20 years, in my opinion, but there is room for that -- it seems as though there is room for that to occur here as we move forward. 
Operator: Your next question is coming from David Wu from Global Crown Capital. 
David Wu - Global Crown Capital: Thank you for taking my call. Two quick questions, first on the CMOS side. As I look at your revenue, it looks like it has been flat, roughly quarter on quarter. You mentioned that ASP has been rising slightly. Does that mean that unit volume is kind of flat on a unit basis? I assume when you talk about VGA a quarter of the business, you are talking about units or are you talking about dollars? Then I have a question on memory, which is NAND. At this point, everybody is gung-ho on expanding capacity and you have a rich friend at Intel, so you are not going to blink. Do you think we might have a bloodbath sometime in ’07?
Mike Sadler: I will address the image sensor questions, and I will let Steve address the NAND question, if that is okay.  On the image sensor front, our revenues in Q4 grew slightly over Q3 and our unit volume grew slightly as well. It is true that the growth rate certainly levelled Q4 versus Q3. I would attribute that to a couple of things. Number one, I mentioned earlier that we had accumulated some VGA sensor inventory that we were not sure to interpret that as a slowdown in phone sales or perhaps just some indigestion of inventory, if you will. In fact, things have picked up significantly since we accumulated that inventory, so I think we are back on a growth track again.  Secondly, kind of from a macro view, we have been riding a growing penetration rate of cameras in mobile phones for the past three years. Once we reach close to 100%, obviously that has to level off somewhere, and the growth we are going to see, the result of two camera phones and replacement phones, and I do not think we are there yet at 100% penetration, but certainly we are at a point where three-quarters or so of the world’s mobile phones have cameras in them, and naturally, that business is going to slow down somewhat. We do not believe it is going to decrease, but we certainly believe the growth rate is going to slow down.  We also firmly believe that there are several other markets that are going to drive strong growth for us. Video conferencing in notebook PCs would probably be the first one on the docket in terms of driving big growth for us in fiscal 2007. Do-it-yourself security systems is another. Digital still cameras is another, and automotive would probably be the next.  So there are several other markets we believe are going to be big demand drivers for us. It just so happens that at this point in time, they have not really become that significant in terms of driving big demand for us.  Now, on the NAND front, Steve, do you want to -- Steve, do you want to take that?
Steven Appleton: Let me first throw out there that there are a number of reasons that we are doing NAND, so despite the fact that there is capacity coming on NAND and we are a part of that, getting into that market because of the growth rate of that market is clearly one piece of it. We have a couple of others, and I will come back to those in a second.  In terms of whether we think there is too much NAND capacity or not enough NAND capacity for ’07, I guess I would add the comment that I do not know if anyone can predict it, frankly, because we are in such a high-priced elasticity correlation on NAND right now for growing density and lowering cost, it would be tough for anyone to predict.  Clearly there is going to be more capacity that comes into the market, but frankly, we have never said, and if you have listened to us for a while now, we have never said that we thought NAND would not be volatile, or it would not have either great expansions or periods of time where you have pretty heavy price declines because of over-supply. We think in fact that will occur.  Having said that though, we do not think it is going to be any worse than DRAM, and in fact, we believe that the opportunity for NAND is better than DRAM because we think that NAND really looks more like DRAM did in the up to 1995, so pre ’95, in which net net it was a pretty good business overall. In other words, the up cycles were longer than the down cycles, and those of us that were good at it made money in the DRAM business, up to the period of time where the price elasticity was pretty good. Although even then, it was into a relatively narrow market with a narrow customer base, NAND actually is a much broader customer base and a lot broader number of applications, so the potential for margin pressure, if you will, I think is not eliminated but reduced by virtue of this variety of channels it goes through, where you actually have opportunity to have more value add.  To think about how long it took the DRAM market to get to a differentiated portfolio, effectively it took 25 years for that to occur. Right now, there is a lot of discussion around NAND being high density, et cetera, and that is where you see a lot of the commoditization, but the fact of the matter is there is already a lot of opportunities for differentiation in the NAND space when you start combining it with controllers and interface and software, et cetera, that we think it will have a lessening effect on the volatility.  Having said all of that, NAND for us will clearly help drive a lower R&D cost per wafer and help drive, if you will, a scale gain for us where a lot of the other costs get shared as well, because for two reasons. One, not only do we have more wafers to spread the R&D over, but we also now have a partner sharing that cost. Obviously, as our total business grows, we get the benefit there because if you think about what was happening to us in the DRAM business, we had less and less product that needed an advance process, and that is just by virtue of the market bifurcating and splitting between specialty and what you would think of as PC DRAM, but it did not cost us any less to develop that advanced process. It cost us the same. So we had a rising R&D charge per wafer internally. It did not look like it externally because our silicon production was the same or growing.  We are actually reversing that trend now. In fact, we internally, in all of our numbers, will show a decreasing R&D cost per wafer by virtue of the scaling of our total silicon business and by virtue of the crossover of development, which is essentially about 70% the same between NAND and DRAM.  We are not really focused on just the supply side in ’07. I cannot predict whether what you said is a bloodbath will occur or not, but that does not change our course, not because we have a rich partner, but because of the other benefits that it brings to our business. 
Operator: Your next question is coming from Douglas Freedman from AMTECH Research. You may go ahead. 
Doug Freedman - Amtech Research: Thanks for taking my question. Steve, if you could, we just missed on basically execution of spending the cap-ex and removing $500 million from ’06 into ’07, if I heard you correctly. When are you expecting that catch-up to occur? We should be entering the peak, if I remember your slide that you presented recently. 
Steven Appleton: On the cap-ex side, I think we need to be careful to differentiate three things. One is when does the equipment get installed. The second is when do you actually pay for it, and the third is when does it show up on the books. Oddly enough, all three of those are slightly different.  It was interesting, because when we came out and our cap-ex was lower by this number that you just mentioned, half a billion or so, I think a lot of people thought that we were -- in fact, there were articles that we were deferring or pushing cap-ex. We have done nothing of the such, nothing even remotely close. All of that is being driven by when this stuff gets either on the books or when it gets cash flowed.  In terms of schedules of capital implementation, I suppose it is always possible they are off a few weeks here and there, but the fact of the matter is the big capital projects are on schedule within a pretty tight band.  In terms of producing product based on the capital that we have been forecasting to spend, all of that is happening. The rest of it, frankly, is just an accounting nuance as to when the timing hits and cash flow and assets.  By the way, to answer your question more specifically, it probably gets almost all caught up by the end of ‘07 or the first part of ‘08. 
Doug Freedman - Amtech Research: Okay, so it is actually -- we are still in a peak spending period as we exit ’07. 
Steven Appleton: It is fair to say for us, I think, fiscal ’07 will be a peak for us in terms of what we report as capital expenditures. 
Doug Freedman - Amtech Research: Then if I could just move on to, you have given us some targets on wafer loading as a percent of wafer loading by product. Any change to those numbers for the end of ’07?
Kipp Bedard: We had previously talked about core DRAM around 40% toward the end of ’06, Flash being 10% to 15%, or mid-teens, CMOS image sensors, 20% to 25%, and specialty DRAM 20% to 25%. Those are still appropriate.  For the end of ’07 timeframe, expect core DRAM to be 20% to 30%, Flash 30%-ish, plus or minus, CMOS image sensors, 20% to 25%, and specialty DRAM 20% to 25%. 
Doug Freedman - Amtech Research: My last question for you, Lexar Bits, what percentage of Lexar sales are being supported by IMFT fabs presently and what do you think that will do in Q1?
Steven Appleton: I do not think it is going to change much, by the way, for the next couple of quarters. We have customer commitments for the current output, so Lexar right now, as you may know, they had good supply relationships in place. Prior to the acquisition, those supplier relationships had remained in place. We actually do not have much, if anything, to allocate to Lexar in the next couple of quarters. Even if we did, by the way, I think our strategy is to have downstream, external and internal supply to meet their needs.  In particular, when you look at their product portfolio and our product portfolio, they do not necessarily match up exactly right now for part of their products because they had historical practices of buying things from these other suppliers, and there are some differences. I think it will take quite a bit of time for those all to sort their way out. 
Doug Freedman - Amtech Research: Any clue on what we should think about gross margins for their business next quarter, given the fact that spot NAND prices seem to be declining?
Steven Appleton: We are still sorting through that ourselves. I think suffice it to say that if you looked at their historical results, they had pretty poor margins. We are weekly, if not daily, working on fixing all of that. So the guy that runs that business for us, Mark Adams -- who was a new COO at Lexar, he had only been there a couple of months when we engaged to acquire them -- is really focused on that and I think doing a pretty good job.  I think the answer is they will improve from where they were. How much progress is made in the next quarter, I do not know. I cannot really respond to that yet because they are still working on it. 
Doug Freedman - Amtech Research: Thank you. 
Kipp Bedard: Thank you, Doug, and with that, we would actually like to wrap up the call now. We would like to thank everyone for participating today.

Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of the presentation to conform these statements to actual results.  With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Stover. 
Bill Stover: Thanks, Kipp. For Micron, it was a strong operational quarter in a period which seasonally is not usually that strong. Net sales totaled $1.31 billion, and the Company recorded net income of $89 million, or $0.12 per fully diluted share. These quarterly results for the period ended June 1st are the first period to consolidate Tech Semiconductor’s operations and do not yet pick up any results of Lexar Media, for which our acquisition closed on June 21st.  Net sales grew 24% over a year ago, and 7% over the immediately preceding quarter. Our diversification effort continues to strengthen as sales of our Digital Clarity Image Sensors now represent 16% total sales. Sales of NAND memory compromised approximately 5% of total sales in the third quarter, including the sale of NAND devices manufactured in IM Flash Technologies to Intel.  Gross margin for the third quarter came in at 25%, up from 19% in the immediately preceding quarter and 8% a year ago. The gross margin improvement was principally the result of strategic shifts in product mix to higher margin devices and some strengthening of DRAM average selling prices. Our specialty DRAM and CMOS image sensors continue to rank as our highest gross margin percentage product offering.  As this quarter is the transition quarter to consolidation of Tech Semiconductor, it seems appropriate to acknowledge the effect on consolidation. Simply said, there was no significant effect. The margin on products sold in our third quarter that were manufactured at Tech Semiconductor was essentially the same as that enjoyed by the Company under the previous pricing under the supply agreement. On a go-forward basis, since Tech utilizes Micron's designs and processes, Tech's manufacturing cost will inherently be similar to Micron's other wholly-owned operation.  As of third quarter end, Micron had cash and investment balances of $2.8 billion and subsequent to quarter end, balances have ranged from $3 billion to $3.2 billion. Total debt, now inclusive of Tech Semiconductor, is approximately $520 million, for a debt to equity ratio of 7%.  Capital expenditures, that is additions to property, plant and equipment, have totaled to slightly in excess of $1 billion through the first nine months of the fiscal year. Our estimate for the fiscal year ending August 31st is a total of approximately $2.2 billion.  The significant increase in the balance of the year is reflective of the activity we have mentioned for some time in our Virginia 300 millimeter fab and the Lehi, Utah flash technology fab and Boise R&D facility.  R&D expense for the third quarter was $168 million and SG&A expenditures reached $113 million. The increase in SG&A is reflective of the stage of development of historical legal matters and the inclusion of Tech Semiconductor. The current level of R&D is likely representative of near-term expenses, but SG&A will increase to approximately $130 million for our fourth quarter as a result of the inclusion of Lexar Media for ten weeks of the quarter.  For the last three years, we've had continued improvement in cash flow provided by operations. The overall improvement reflects our successful diversification efforts and the third quarter's operating cash flow reached $384 million.  Additionally in the third quarter, we collected $171 million from settlement of our call spread option. Quarter over quarter, you'll note some increases across the balance sheet. Notably inventories, property, plant and equipment, accounts payable and the non-controlling interest in subsidiaries. All of those are the results of the consolidation of Tech Semiconductor.  As a final discussion item, I'll make a couple of comments on the expected accounting for our Lexar Media acquisition. The purchase price, based on the approximately 50 million Micron shares exchanged and the value of options assumed is about $900 million. A large portion of the purchase price may be ascribed to goodwill and therefore be a non-depreciating asset.  Additionally, the Company does not expect our fourth quarter revenues to be measurably higher as a result of the Lexar acquisition, as the Company will not recognize revenue from Lexar products in the distribution channel at the June 21st closing date. With that, I'll turn the commentary over to Mike. 
Mike Sadler : Thanks, Bill. We are pleased with demand strength in the various markets that we serve. Our product diversification efforts in memory and imaging are resulting in a desirable mix of revenues in market segments such as desktop and notebook computing, mobile phones, servers, consumer electronics, communications infrastructure, as well as a few other segments.  From a demand perspective, moving into what is traditionally a seasonally strong second half of the calendar year, we are optimistic about the Company's prospects. We're not seeing many surprises in the PC market. The industry is experiencing unit growth rates in the low double-digits. When compounded by DRAM content expansion, this calendar year the PC markets are driving DRAM megabit demand growth of around 45% to 50%.  This growth rate has been sufficient to move our DRAM ASP up by approximately 20% in the PC space over the past quarter. We are happy with memory content per PC growth and look forward to what will essentially be a step function content increase occurring with the Vista operating system launch in 2007.  The DDR 2 interface continues to gain penetration momentum in the PC space. I now estimate the demand profile to be about 3:1 in favor of DDR 2 verses DDR 1. Micron's output is more balanced between the two interface technologies. We maintain the entire DDR 1 product portfolio on advanced processes and are growing market shares in the non-PC markets that still favor DDR 1.  We continue to place priority on development and delivery of high density DRAM components and modules for the server space. Recently we were first to market with a 2 gigabyte DDR 2 component on our 78 nanometer technology. We are in the process of moving this device to volume production. This product differentiation strategy brings time market value to our customers, enabling us to create a defendable market share position in high value server applications.  As I've stated in the past, mobile phones are perhaps the most intriguing market segment for Micron. This is a very large market, approaching 1 billion units per year. The primary application shift from voice to data is creating a slew of new opportunities for Micron imagers, DRAM and NAND products.  As our Italy operation has reached critical mass in CMOS imager production, we were able to achieve in excess of 30% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in the just completed quarter. With Idaho and Italy fabrication areas running full steam ahead, we have both production redundancy and head room for growth. We are currently taking additional share in a growing market, and believe that we now are enjoying close to 40% share in the CMOS imager market.  In order to continue fulfilling growing customer demands, we have announced plans to initiate CMOS imager production in our fab in Nishiwaki, Japan. Following this addition, we will have three fabs on three continents to support the expanding customer base.  Memory subsystems in the mobile phone market are shifting from a base of NOR to NAND flash. We have just introduced Micron's first version of a NAND multi-chip package, or MCP, combining our own low-power DRAM with an IMFT produced 1.8 volt NAND flash device. Micron is among a select few suppliers with this capability. Many of our current mobile phone customers are designing our NAND plus DRAM MCPs into their future handset lineup. We look forward to adding these products to our existing portfolio of discreet, low power DRAM and pseudo-static RAM devices for the mobile communications market.  Complementing the MCP effort, we recently announced the development of our managed NAND product family. This offering combines Micron's NAND memory with a high speed MMC controller offering extremely high speed data transfer rates. We see attractive growth potential in the consumer electronics market, and are in fact already experiencing significant memory and imaging business in this area.  One key difference in consumer markets is that we see even more fragmentation of memory solutions due to the wide variety of end products. This is welcome, as it allows us to leverage the many product development and customer engagement resources that we have around the world.  The newest additions to Micron, of course, are the talented team, brand equity and channel expertise that comes with our acquisition of Lexar. The Lexar capabilities are a great fit and perfect complement to what already exists within the Micron infrastructure. We will leverage the Lexar brand and retail channel presence, combining this with IMFT manufactured NAND, we will quickly become a vertically integrated provider of NAND solutions to retail and OEM customers, thus unlocking incremental value for Micron in the process.  We're quite pleased with today's demand and the longer-term trends in the various market segments that we serve. We believe that our differentiated product strategy and execution to that strategy speaks for itself with the continued delivery of positive results.  As the IMFT operation reaches critical mass and we take advantage of economy of scale in NAND flash production, the Company will realize even more efficiencies. Thanks for your continued support and interest in the Company. I'll turn it back over to Kipp. 
Kipp Bedard: Thanks, Mike. With that we'd like to take questions from callers. With that, we'd like to open up the line. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question is coming from Michael Masdea – Credit Suisse.
 Michael Masdea – Credit Suisse : Thanks a lot. Maybe for Bill. On Lexar, is there any more detail you can give us on how much you're expecting? Also, given what you said about visibility in the channel, when do you think that sort of overhang in terms of getting that product sold through will be cleared up and we can assume more normal revenue growth for what hits your P&L? 
Bill Stover: Mike, it's somewhat coincidental, but the volume of product which they had in the channel at the June 21st date, essentially carries them through the August 31st, coincident with the end of our fiscal quarter and year. Beginning with the new fiscal year, it looks like that is when we're going to pick that up.  Is that answering your question there, Mike? 
 Michael Masdea – Credit Suisse : Are there any more details you can give us on any of the financials in terms of the impact of Lexar? Or is that it at this point? 
Bill Stover: At this point we'll just be looking through the allocation of the purchase price. As I indicated in the opening comments, there's quite a significant amount that would end up in the goodwill after the allocation to the assets, brand, channel, intellectual property. 
 Michael Masdea – Credit Suisse : Fair enough. On the DRAM side, actually a little bit of a decline this quarter. Talk about that a little bit, especially in light of what you said about still seeing low double-digit growth for the PC market. Why did we see so little growth in the DRAM space?  Following on, it looks like your big growth this year is going to be pretty low for overall DRAM bits; can you give us an update on that number, if you could? 
Kipp Bedard: I can start on the production side. We basically guided low single-digits last quarter because we're taking more wafers and moving them into the image sensor space.  How that relates to sales, relative to Mike's comments of a pretty decent quarter over quarter, we just didn't have additional bits to ship. We had very little inventory at the end of last quarter. Basically what we produced during the quarter is what we shipped.  Mike, would you like to add anything on the marketing side? 
Mike Sadler : Mike, the reduced DRAM bit sales are really just – probably to repeat what Kipp said -- it's just a function of what we produced. Obviously our capacity has been shifted towards more image sensor production and ramping up our NAND flash operation. At the end of the day, at least in the quarter we just completed, the DRAM megabit output did suffer somewhat from the increases in the imaging and the NAND business.  From a market standpoint, the market is clicking along about like we expected. We probably saw a DRAM demand increase in our last quarter somewhere between 10% and 15%. We did lose DRAM market share. In the quarter that we're entering, on a polling of our large PC customers, we're looking at DRAM bit growth demand of probably around 15% to 17%. So from a demand standpoint, the market looks pretty darn healthy. 
Bill Stover: From a guidance perspective, Michael, just for your models, you'll be looking at about mid single-digit bit growth on the PC DRAM, higher than that on both NAND flash and image sensors for Q4. 
 Michael Masdea – Credit Suisse : Just a last question on the image sensor side. There are some concerns out there about handset strength. Maybe someone can talk about what they are seeing from the order perspective. Given the growth you saw, any concerns about inventory in that channel at all? 
Mike Sadler : First of all on the inventory question, none whatsoever. We're flush on inventory. I mean, we get stuff out of our production line and it's gone the next day. So we've got no inventory concerns. Based on a polling out of our customers, the handset customers as well as the camera integrators, I am not concerned at all about inventory in the channel.  In the handset market, we're benefiting both from growing number of handset units as well as continued penetration of cameras and handsets. So we're still looking at pretty significant growth. Obviously the last quarter was huge growth for us. As I look out over the course of the next couple of quarters, we're looking at pretty significant growth in both units and revenues on the image sensor side for mobile phone cameras here, at least over the next couple of quarters. 
 Michael Masdea – Credit Suisse : Great, thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shawn Webster - JP Morgan. 
Shawn Webster – JP Morgan: You talked a little bit about the bit growth and PC DRAM. Can you talk about how you see global DRAM shipments in calendar '06? And how you see Micron’s bit supply growing in calendar '06? Could you give us an update on that, and then I have a follow-up question. 
Mike Sadler : Your first question, I presume, was a reference to the overall market in terms of DRAM bit growth. It is probably around 50%. I say that 50% is going to be accurate within plus or minus 5% in terms of demand growth, and supply is going to be in line with that. So a roughly balanced supply/demand environment in calendar 2006 of 50% plus or minus 5%.  Our DRAM bit growth in calendar '06. I don't have this specific figure in my hand, but it is going to be less than the market. Kip, can you comment more specifically on that? 
Kipp Bedard:
Shawn Webster – JP Morgan: Okay. Just to clarify; did you say that you expected end bit demand in calendar Q3 for PCs to be up 15% to 17%? 
Mike Sadler : That's correct. 
Shawn Webster – JP Morgan: On capital expenditures, it looks like you lowered it from a prior 2.6% to 2.2%. Can you talk to us as to what some of the moving parts there were? 
Bill Stover: Every year it always seems to be difficult to predict just how the final months are going to play out. It's just timing of acceptance of tools and we have a large volume that are hitting, but honestly it doesn't come down to accepting and getting those capped to the rate that we had thought six months ago. So the 2.6% has been brought down to 2.2%. 
Shawn Webster – JP Morgan: Was there any change to your fiscal '07 guidance at this point? 
Bill Stover: At fiscal '07 we're looking at $3.5 billion. As we had previously indicated, there's about $1 billion of that which you can think of as historical Micron; there is $500 million or so that is in the Tech Semiconductor and $2 billion or so is in the IM flash. 
Shawn Webster – JP Morgan: Turning to NAND, can you tell us what your NAND bit production and NAND bit shipments were sequentially in May? 
Kipp Bedard: We're not going to get into bit guidance on NAND flash, we will give you some wafer references. We ran out of our total productive capacity, about 11% was aimed at NAND flash and that will go up a percent or two this quarter, meaning fiscal Q4. Then you'll see a pretty substantial ramp in wafer outs moving into the calendar Q4 area. 
Shawn Webster – JP Morgan: Thank you very much. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Covello – Goldman Sachs. 
 Jim Covello – Goldman Sachs: Hey, guys, thanks so much. We got the bit guidance for the next quarter. Any thoughts on ASPs in the different is segments for us? 
Mike Sadler : Well we can't predict what ASPs are going to do going forward. I can tell you, Jim, that in the DRAM environment if we were to see a stable DRAM price from now through the end of our quarter, the overall for the Company, the DRAM average selling prices will be roughly flat quarter over quarter. In other words, they've been relatively stable for the first three weeks of our fiscal Q4.  In the NAND flash area, prices in early Q3 for us, they went down; they stabilized somewhat toward the middle of the quarter and they actually trended up a little bit in the latter part of our Q3. If prices were to be flat going forward, for the balance of this quarter in the flash world, they'd be flat to down 5% quarter over quarter. We're expecting flash prices are going to continue to tick up a little bit through our fiscal Q4 and fiscal Q1. 
 Jim Covello – Goldman Sachs: Okay, that's helpful. If I can ask you a quick follow-up. On the image sensor business, I know on the 10-Q you guys break out the margins by product. Can you tell us now what the image sensor margins were this quarter and then what you think the long-term margin target in that business is? 
Bill Stover: We ran about 40% gross margin, Jim, on image sensors this quarter. I'm not going to make a stab at trying to predict what they'll be long-term. 
 Jim Covello – Goldman Sachs:
Kipp Bedard: Down slightly, 44% last quarter. 
 Jim Covello – Goldman Sachs: I'm sorry, you were talking about gross margins there. I guess without predicting a long-term model, do we think that level is sustainable given the competition? 
Bill Stover: You're asking me to predict a couple of different things. I can obviously argue a pretty good case for cost reductions we have coming, but trying to predict pricing in this business, like anything else, is pretty difficult. I'll leave that to you experts. 
 Jim Covello – Goldman Sachs: Thanks so much, I appreciate it. 
Operator: Our next question comes from John Lau – Jefferies & Co.
 John Lau – Jefferies & Co.: Great, thanks. You gave us an indication with regard to how strong the image sensor market is and the inventory levels for the wireless handsets. I was wondering if you could also give us your market indications about what's happening in the PC market? Especially given that there's a lot of concerns out there of a stall coming. We notice that the pricing has been stable, but we wanted to get your input on that. Thank you. 
Mike Sadler : My visibility on PC inventories, either in the channel or at our customers, would not be of much value. I just don't have visibility into that. I do have pretty good visibility into, of course, our DRAM component and module inventory, whether it be in the hands of the customer or in our own hands, I can tell you that the shelves are bare. We’ve got virtually nothing in stock here at Micron, and when I look out into the Micron-owned inventories at the customer sites, they're basically empty, as well.  From our viewpoint, there is no inventory. Now obviously I couldn’t speak for our competitors, nor could I really speak for the channel players. But we're not putting much, if any, Micron product in the channel either. From inventory standpoint, we're in great shape. 
 John Lau – Jefferies & Co.: But, Mike, if you take that thought one step further, the current inventory levels are pretty lean, as you say. Looking into the second half of this year, with the inventories lean at this level, what do you think the supply-demand balance will be for the rest of the year given that you're actually slowing down your wafer starts? 
Mike Sadler : Well, certainly the amount of product that we're going to be putting into the market is going to be less than what the market appetite is, basically. So we're not going to be putting pressure from a supply standpoint on the market.  My view is that supply and demand are probably going to be roughly in balance; if anything, I think we're in a situation where there are going to be pockets of market segments where demand is going to exceed supply. In general, we feel quite bullish about the prospects in the DRAM market for the second half of the year. If nothing else, based on the seasonal demand for consumer items, mobile phones, PCs as well as the continued content growth we are seeing. So we feel pretty good about it. 
 John Lau – Jefferies & Co.: Great, thank you very much. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Glen Yeung – Citigroup. 
Glen Yeung – Citigroup: We hear you saying we want to make image sensors, more NAND flash, and having to reduce wafers in DRAM to do that. Is there a stair target that you're willing to live with in the DRAM side? Just so we get a sense as to when you may have to stop moving wafers around? 
Mike Sadler : Well, I think that the objectives on market share aren't really specific in terms of a particular percentage. We clearly are willing to accept less and less market share until we've reached an exposure into the PC space that we're comfortable with. I can tell you that it is still significantly less than where that is today.  The transition of our wafer portfolio is rapidly occurring away from product that goes into the PC space. You just saw from our release that for the first time in our history, sales of product from Micron into the PC space just dropped below the majority. I would expect that over the next 12 months, maybe 18 months, to probably at least go in half as these other products grow for us.  Now it doesn't mean that we're necessarily producing that much less DRAM, because the DRAM we're producing, the low-power DRAM, the pseudo-static RAM and the stuff that goes into wireless and NCPs, that is actually pretty good. In fact, that will continue to grow, in particular when you look at the consumption in the server space.  A lot of the product and a lot of the effort we have right now is in that area. So I'm not projecting that our overall DRAM market share will cut down in half. I'm just saying that the stuff that goes into the PC space will drop dramatically.  Yes, we'll lose some market share on the DRAM space, but we’re willing to accept that down to the level where we have to have some presence there. But down to the level where we actually would be considering adding more wafers back into the DRAM space for the good markets as they grow. 
Glen Yeung – Citigroup: Okay. Makes sense. When you look out into the competitive environment, if we're just taking on the DRAM side, is there anyone over which you will lose sleep at night? Are there any players out there where you think boy, these guys are looking to be very aggressive here in terms of adding capacity or trying to gain share or both? 
Mike Sadler : For which space are you talking about? 
 Glenn Young – Citigroup : For the DRAM space. 
Mike Sadler : Well, I don't know anything more than what you know from the public reports on capacity being added. One of the reasons that we're pursuing the strategy we have been is because of irrational capacity that come along, in particular the easiest space to get into is the PC space, because they have the least demand in terms of all of those things that companies like ourselves are capable of doing on the service side; whether it be quality or supply chain, et cetera.  I don't see anything particular out there that we're concerned with, other than just the historical behavior, the market is pretty good. They tend to crowd too much capacity into it. 
 Glenn Young – Citigroup : Okay, all right. Well, thanks. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Gomberg - Thomas Weisel Partners. 
Eric Gomberg - Thomas Weisel Partners : I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what is going on in IM flash in terms of the road map? Maybe talk about the densities of the production at this point and where you'd expect it to be over the next couple of quarters? 
 Mark Durcan: As we've said before, we're running primarily 90 nanometer NAND today and well into shipping 72 nanometer SLC products. We did qualify and are sampling 90 nanometer MLC, but primarily, we're focused on the 72 nanometer node and qualifying and shipping 72 nanometer MLC in 2007.  With respect to further out, I think we'll wait and talk about nodes beyond that with our partner Intel, probably sometime later this year. 
Eric Gomberg - Thomas Weisel Partners : In terms of chip capacity, this is primarily 2 gigabit at this point? 
 Mark Durcan: 2 gigabit and 4 gigabit now moving into the marketplace, also. 
Eric Gomberg - Thomas Weisel Partners :
 Mark Durcan: Well, that's a good question, actually. We have use for all of our current NAND forecasted output, at least in the near term. As a result, we would expect Lexar to continue on their business model with their supply agreements as far as we can see in the future. So we think that actually would be incremental to what we're doing here. 
Eric Gomberg - Thomas Weisel Partners : Could you just -- maybe I missed it before -- but talk a little bit about the composition of the inventory? You talked earlier that it's up a little bit. Where is that sitting in terms of product? 
Mike Sadler : Actually, the finished goods inventory is down quarter over quarter. What we have -- it is not much -- but what we have, we have probably an equal distribution of NAND flash, DRAM and virtually no image sensors. We have some inventory in place at the customers, our vendor-owned inventory. Very little in Micron warehouses. Basically there is not much inventory at all. Certainly less than two weeks, probably closer to one week for the finished goods inventory. 
Bill Stover: If the question in part was looking at the balance sheet and the growth in inventory dollars, the finished goods down as Mike indicated; raw materials flat. The only growth is in the work in process, and that's just as a result of the Tech Semiconductor consolidation, overall throughout the historic Micron operations are actually down. 
Eric Gomberg - Thomas Weisel Partners : Very helpful, thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Tim Luke – Lehman Brothers.
Tim Luke – Lehman Brothers : With respect to Lexar, could you give us any framework for how we should think about that in terms of revenue in the fiscal '07 period? 
Kipp Bedard: There's not a lot of guidance we can give. You have to keep in mind, we only closed a week ago. You obviously have all of their numbers up until that point in time.  Our intent is, of course, to take where they're at and try to grow that business. To the degree we're able to do that, that's something we'll have to look at in the future. But just keep in mind that as Bill said, there won't be any revenues for this quarter by virtue of the way the accounting works, and it will just be incremental after that. 
 Tim Luke – Lehman Brothers : But in terms of SG&A, we are going to model 130 going forward and the R&D you think is going to be fairly flattish going forward? 
Kipp Bedard: Yes, both of those are correct. The 130 reference was specifically for Q4 and ten weeks of the quarter, incremental Lexar activity. 
 Tim Luke – Lehman Brothers : Kip, can you just clarify on the 17% bit growth, and how that breaks down? What were you alluding to with respect to 15% to 17% growth? 
Kipp Bedard: Sure, that was Mike's reference to the demand profile we see in basically our fiscal Q3 over fiscal Q2, driven by PC units and content. 
 Tim Luke – Lehman Brothers : Okay. Going forward in the coming quarter in terms of bit growth then, how do you see that breaking down between the segments? 
Kipp Bedard: Bit growth on a production side from our standpoint? 
 Tim Luke – Lehman Brothers : Yes. 
Kipp Bedard: Mid-single digits on PC DRAM and then higher on flash and image sensors. 
Bill Stover: Higher than that. 
 Tim Luke – Lehman Brothers : Lastly just in terms of accounting. In the May quarter, it looks like there was this non-controlling interest and net loss of 17, and then there seemed to be a pretty high interest income number of 27. How should we think about the interest income number going forward? Is this non-controlling interest and net loss a one-time thing? How should we think about that? Thank you. 
Bill Stover: Yes, on the interest income. As we’ve indicated, we had some very significant growth in cash and short-term investment balances. It was also indicated that we've got a pretty good capital spend profile ahead of us, including next year's being a bit front loaded in the year.  If you look at the next couple of quarters, and thought about $20 million in the interest income, you're probably in the right ballpark, with that tailing off a bit later next year.  On the non-controlling interest, the $17 million was virtually all a result of the Tech Semiconductor consolidation and the purchase accounting. If you think about Tech Semiconductor on a go forward basis over a time horizon, it's more likely to be close to breakeven. So not anticipating a significant non-controlling interest charge in any quarter is the right way to look at it. 
 Tim Luke – Lehman Brothers : It will be somewhere lower than $17 million going forward, between that and zero? 
Bill Stover: Likely. 
 Tim Luke – Lehman Brothers : Thank you very much. 
Kipp Bedard: Tim, I just wanted to correct one thing I said before. I guided you to PC DRAM bit growth of mid-single digits. That will actually be flat this next quarter, but costs will actually come down in the mid to single-digit range. 
 Tim Luke – Lehman Brothers : Say that again? Your bit growth in terms of production for PC DRAM will be flat?
Kipp Bedard: Will be flat Q4 over Q3, yes. 
 Tim Luke – Lehman Brothers : And the other areas would be higher than that? 
Kipp Bedard: You're going to see growth in the other areas, correct. 
 Tim Luke – Lehman Brothers : Why would you not see bit growth in PC DRAM? 
Kipp Bedard: Similar to what we've talked about before. Wafers are still moving into other products; Specialty DRAM, image sensors, NAND. 
 Tim Luke – Lehman Brothers : But you would think that it's a growth quarter in terms of revenue for you. 
Kipp Bedard: Well, that would be your own discussion about ASPs. I think Mike's probably described an environment where we're going to ship what we make and so then you'll have to determine what the ASP effect will have on revenues. 
 Tim Luke – Lehman Brothers : NAND's clearly down and DRAM is flat. Thank you. Thank you so much. 
Kipp Bedard: Well, that's assuming your ASPs – that’s not what Mike has said. But if that's your takeaway, then we respect that. 
 Tim Luke – Lehman Brothers : Actually you said that if it remained as it is for the rest of the quarter, it would be NAND flat to down 5 and DRAM, if it remains as it is, flat. 
Kipp Bedard: Yes, that's giving you a reference point that if those two things happen, then that would be the effect. Mike's not making a prediction on what the market will do for the next few months. 
 Tim Luke – Lehman Brothers : Sure. Sure. Thank you so much for that clarification, Kip. 
Kipp Bedard: You bet. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Joseph Osha – Merrill Lynch. 
 Joseph Osha – Merrill Lynch : Hi, Kipp, I'm sorry, color me confused. Following on the previous question, it sounds like you are saying that approximately half or somewhat less than half of your DRAM business that doesn't go into the PC end market is going to see production growth and presumably shipment growth. Is that correct? 
Kipp Bedard: Correct. 
 Joseph Osha – Merrill Lynch : Okay. And you talked about the PC business overall being less than the majority of the revenue. That presumably includes the other non-DRAM businesses. Are you able to give us some color in terms of what the end market composition of what your DRAM business is? 
Kipp Bedard: Yes, we can do that. Mike will share that with you here promptly. 
Mike Sadler : From a market segment standpoint, Joe, I can give you some ballpark figures here. I apologize, by the way, this is not necessarily broken out, it doesn't single out DRAM. But in terms of our overall revenue mix, how about if I rank the market segments for you?  Desktop and notebook computing would be the largest. Mobile terminals, handsets basically would be number 2. Servers would be number 3. Consumer electronics would be number 4. Then there are a mish mash of segments beyond that. But that's the ranking. Those four that I named are very significant in terms of revenue dollars. 
 Joseph Osha – Merrill Lynch : Okay. Well, then it sounds to me like if your PC business is -- hypothetically assuming that pricing is flat and nobody knows – but if it is then your PC DRAM business doesn't generate any revenue growth. But if you're able to see shipment growth in your non-PC DRAM businesses that would generate revenue growth. Is that correct? 
Mike Sadler : That is a fair assumption. 
 Joseph Osha – Merrill Lynch : Okay. The last question would be then, is the margin on your non-PC DRAM stuff better than your PC stuff? Or the same, or worse?
Mike Sadler : I can rank them for you like we have in past quarters, Joe. Image sensors are still the highest gross margin followed by specialty DRAM. This quarter, NAND and DRAM flip-flopped; PC DRAM flip-flopped, so PC DRAM is third and NAND fourth. 
 Joseph Osha – Merrill Lynch : Last question, I guess for Bill. Seems like there would have to be some operational and gross margin synergies for Lexar. Would it be fair to say, a year to 18 months out, that the objective is to meet all of Lexar’s NAND requirements with internally sourced wafers? That's the first thing.  The second thing is at the operational level, do you have some thoughts about the synergies you might ring out of that as we think about how the integrated model will look? 
 Steve Appleton: First of all, given the growth profile of, I think the NAND demand and given some of the other obligations that we already have in place or that we're working on, I'm not confident that 18 months from now all supply comes internal.  However, having said that, as Lexar has noted themselves publicly, they have some pretty good supply relationships now that I think would be advantageous for them that remained in place after the acquisition.  So if the Lexar team does their job, that business will grow in addition to the business that we have growing. So we will get operational synergies. There's no question about that. I think we'll be able to bring some efficiencies to that model.  But also remember that part of the Lexar business is in controllers and a few other things, which we're actually looking to invest more R&D in what they have been doing, as opposed to less R&D; but get more efficiencies on the operational and the SG&A side. 
 Joseph Osha – Merrill Lynch : Okay. Understood, thanks guys. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Dave Wong – AG Edwards. 
 Dave Wong – AG Edwards : Thank you very much, can you give us any idea of what gross margins Lexar products are currently selling for? 
 Steve Appleton: It's too early for us to do that, Dave. We just got our hands on it. The thing that I think is important to highlight, and I think this question has come up a number of times, and that is: boy, have you really done enough planning, given we had enough time to know we were going to close on Lexar or not close on Lexar. The fact of the matter is there was some uncertainty until we were able to complete the transaction. As a result, I think this is the first time in my history where both boards approved a transaction and yet there was still uncertainty in the market as to the transaction closing. As a result, we really didn't know whether we were going to be competitors or partners, so to speak, with Lexar right up until the closing. So we couldn't do as much planning -- and frankly we didn't get as much visibility into some of the things that they were working on and developing -- as we would have normally liked to.  Obviously we had enough insight to know we wanted to do the deal. But it's just going to take us a little bit of time to get our hands around that. It's just too new to us right now. 
 Dave Wong – AG Edwards : If I could just follow up quickly on that, though. For all of your non-Lexar stuff you had really good margins this quarter, about 25% gross margin. Are there any things, pricing aside, are there any other things that affect gross margin in coming quarter? Are there any special costs? The VTech, there's no effect from VTech now, right? Are there any other factors there? 
Kipp Bedard: Sure, we have costs coming down on a multiple of our products. We've got potentially some, as Mike described earlier, some upward trending -- NAND flash ASPs potentially on the quarter, as well. Of course the more allocation comes from the higher margin products, which is image sensors and specialty DRAM, then that is a positive impact on gross margins as well. 
 Dave Wong – AG Edwards : Great, thanks. 
Operator: Your next question is coming from David Wu – Global Crown Capital. 
 David Wu – Global Crown Capital: Yes, Mike, can you talk a little bit about sensors. I was just wondering two things: number one, your gross margin dropped sequentially. Is that a function of VGA graphics being a bigger percentage of the total? Secondly, roughly how much are these 1.3 and 2 megapixel sensors versus the VGA graphics for you guys? 
Mike Sadler : David, from a mix standpoint in terms pixels, roughly half of the units we ship for VGA sensors have 1, 2, 3 and 5 megapixel sensors. That's ballpark, ballpark half. I think it's safe to say that our margins on VGA sensors are lower than they are on 1 megapixel -- actually the greater pixel density per chip, the greater our margins are. That is a pretty safe general statement.  Actually, I may have answered all of your questions there in one sentence.
 David Wu – Global Crown Capital: Pretty good. Are there going to be shortages still? I think the last time you talked publicly you said you were 15% under shipment. 
Mike Sadler : I think we left some business on the table from a supply standpoint in our fiscal Q3. In fiscal Q4, we are three weeks into fiscal Q4, I think we're about right even with demand, basically. I think we're able to meet the demands of the market in fiscal Q4.  With Italy really running full steam now and some capacity additions that we've got planned in Idaho as well as looking at starting sensors in Japan, certainly by fiscal Q1, I think we're going to be in great shape in terms of being able to meet the needs of the market from a supply standpoint. 
 David Wu – Global Crown Capital: At some point would CMOS sensors, possibly be as much as half of your profits at a gross profit level? Because that number keeps going up and your market share keeps going up, so you look at that number and you say, well that's approximately a quarter of the earnings. If you keep that up, it won't be too long before it approaches half. 
Kipp Bedard: Was there a question in that? 
 David Wu – Global Crown Capital: Well, I just wonder what your plans are? Because you've got another fab coming up, Japan. 
Kipp Bedard: I think our approach is we have, obviously significant capacity in a variety of products worldwide, and we want to optimize that capacity. We'll continue to do that to the improvement of the margin.  The only caveat related to that is we do have a partnership with Intel on NAND and we have obligations to continue to invest and ramp that, as we would want to anyhow to substantiate our position in that market.  Again, I think as it has already been encapsulated, we expect the imaging business to grow. We'll keep allocating resources to that business as the demand grows with it. We expect the NAND profile to grow rapidly by virtue of the investments we're making in IMFT; and when it comes to the DRAM, we're going to allocate those resources among the best products for return to the Company. It's just going to go wherever it goes and we'll just have to keep our eye on it. 
 David Wu – Global Crown Capital: Okay, well, thank you. Have a good quarter. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Freedman - AmTech Research. 
 Doug Freedman - AmTech Research : Hey, guys, getting to the bottom of the barrel here, but could you talk about your overall production increase and wafer starts from Q3 to Q4? 
Mike Sadler : You bet. It will be up just a couple percent in terms of wafer outs, Doug. 
 Doug Freedman - AmTech Research : And any plans or update on the scheduling and node at which you are going to convert the Singapore Tech JV to 300 mill? 
Mike Sadler : Can you repeat that again? 
 Doug Freedman - AmTech Research :
 Mark Durcan: We are building out some space right now. We'll be in pilot line mode later this year on 78 nanometer and that would be a 78 nanometer, 300 millimeter ramp of that. 
 Doug Freedman - AmTech Research : All right. Terrific, thank you. 
Operator: Your next question is coming from Hans Mosesmann – Moors & Cabot. 
 Hans Mosesmann – Moors & Cabot : Thank you, most of my questions have been answered. I do have a question, though, regarding the multi-chip module solution in the wireless space. Are you saying that there's certain OEMs in the wireless space that are abandoning NOR and going with a NAND/DRAM solution? 
Mike Sadler : No, I would not say it's accurate to say that certain OEMs are abandoning NOR. I think what's happening as new applications are demanding more memory content, all of the OEMs are making decisions to implement NAND-based MCPs in certain phone models, as opposed to NOR-based MCPs. So what you have today is basically every handset manufacturer that I'm aware of with a line-up of NOR-based MCPs as well as a new line-up of NAND-based MCPs.  What's typically occurring is that the high-density MCPs are deploying NAND plus low power DRAM, and the lower density MCPs are deploying NOR plus pseudo-static. 
 Hans Mosesmann – Moors & Cabot : One follow-up. These higher-end phones with NAND and DRAM, do they have any kind of NOR in the handset? 
Mike Sadler : In some cases they do. In some cases they have a discreet NOR, in other cases they may be implementing the NOR via an MCP with the DRAM or pseudo-static RAM and a standalone embedded NAND flash chip. So there are a whole variety of different configurations.  But in general, the trend is towards more NAND content and less relative NOR content in cell phones, that's a guarantee that's going to occur. You know, it will unfold over the next several years. 
 Hans Mosesmann – Moors & Cabot : Perfect. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Lucas - Appaloosa Management. 
 Michael Lucas - Appaloosa Management: Yes, I just wanted to confirm what you said. Where did you say PC shipments are going? 15% to 17% up, did you say?
Mike Sadler : No, I did not say that. DRAM demand from our PC customers in the calendar Q3 timeframe -- which roughly corresponds with our fiscal Q4 -- will be up quarter-over-quarter 15% to 17%. Now there are two components to that: one is the content per box, and the other of course is the number of boxes. I can’t give you the granularity on that, but overall demand from the PC customer is up 15% to 17% quarter over quarter. 
 Michael Lucas - Appaloosa Management: What is your guys' assumption – do you make any assumptions on what PC shipments will be, or what handsets will be in a given year? 
Mike Sadler : All we do is take the published third-party data. I think in the PC area that is 9% to 12% for the year; and in the handset area, maybe slightly higher than that.
 Michael Lucas - Appaloosa Management: Do you see a demand from some of these lower-end markets that they want cameras in those phones? 
Mike Sadler : Yes. 
 Michael Lucas - Appaloosa Management: Lastly, I know that the market kind of slows you off a little bit here on revenues, God only knows why. But if everything stayed flat, we would see a margin expansion, based on all of the information you've given out on this call, because your costs are going down? Correct?
Kipp Bedard: That's the right assumption, that's correct. 
 Michael Lucas - Appaloosa Management: How much will the costs go down in each one of those areas in terms of image, DRAM and NAND?
Kipp Bedard: We're not going to give you specifics on each one of those. In general, we’ve guided that PC DRAM, which is the largest portion, will be down mid single-digits. 
 Michael Lucas - Appaloosa Management: Okay. All right. Great, thanks. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Krishna Shankar – JMP Securities. 
 Krishna Shankar – JMP Securities: Yes, can you give us the gross margins for each of the four segments for the last quarter and this quarter? You mentioned that CMOS was 44% last quarter -- what are gross margins for the other segments? 
Kipp Bedard: We don't break those out. We just give you the image sensor and then the corporate. 
 Krishna Shankar – JMP Securities: You said that this year DRAM bit production would be fairly well-balanced with demand at about 50 plus or minus 5. Can you hazard a guess as to what it might be next year, given your knowledge of capital spending in DRAMs? 
Kipp Bedard: It looks like, from what's shaping up for spending today, probably a calendar ’07 over ’06 is on production bit growth, probably in the 50% range; maybe a little bit lower. 
 Krishna Shankar – JMP Securities: And with this type of ramp, what could demand growth be, do you think? 
Kipp Bedard: There are some pretty positive trends, which I'll let Mike speak to here. 
Mike Sadler : I think, you know, again keeping in mind that PCs now are not driving the whole DRAM market, but it's certainly the majority of the market. In a non-new operating system year, what we're seeing from the PC market is demand growth rates of 45% to 50%. It stands to reason with the new operating system being layered in with 2000, the incremental effect of that is going to be positive, obviously from a demand standpoint.  I don't know enough to make a specific prediction, but I think it's safe to say that if a normal year is 45% to 50%, next year with the Vista introduction it certainly stands to reason it will be significantly greater than that. But I couldn't give you a specific figure on that. 
 Krishna Shankar – JMP Securities: NAND demand and supply in the second half of ’06, last year we saw the NANO iPod phenomena which literally shot demand up and pricing really escalated. What's your viewpoint on capacity additions to NAND flash going into the second half of this year versus incremental new market drivers? 
Mike Sadler : I don't know on the capacity side. Of course, I know what we're doing from a capacity standpoint. There's no way I could predict with any precision what's happening from a competitive standpoint.  I can say that we have pretty good visibility in the demand. You know, the big drivers of NAND demand, the MP3 audio players, a variety of cards for digital cameras and so forth, hugely dependent upon the seasonal point in the year. We're already seeing significant strength in demand relative to what we were seeing for the past six months.  Again, we're quite bullish on demand for the second half of the year on NAND. You guys are probably in a lot better position to estimate what supply growth is going to be and how well that's going to be lined up to support the growing demand. 
 Krishna Shankar – JMP Securities: Final question, you talked about the growth of MCPs with NAND flash and low part DRAM. Would that take away from the growth of add-ins in cell phones where you have these costs, does that take away from the growth of add-in costs on cell phones, or will it be incremental to add-in costs in cell phones? 
Mike Sadler : I don't believe that's going to be the case. We're seeing so much growth going forward, by the way, both non-volatile and volatile memory content in mobile phones, that I would be hard-pressed to say that cards were going take away from embedded growth or vice versa.  In the non-volatile area, just next year alone we're looking at probably a tripling of flash memory content per phone. On the DRAM side I think we're easily looking at a doubling of memory content per phone. Tremendous growth from a memory standpoint in mobile phones as we move forward, both from embedded as well as detachable cards. 
 Krishna Shankar – JMP Securities: Great, thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Thomas Smith – Standard & Poor’s EQ.
 Thomas Smith – Standard & Poor’s EQ: Yes, following up on phones, I wondered if you had some sort of dollar figure arranged for the addressable markets that you now have in phones? Now that you have sensors and various kinds of memory. 
Mike Sadler : I'm sure we could scratch one up here pretty quickly. But I don’t have it off the top of my head. In terms of the addressable market, considering our image sensor offering and our memory offering, I really don't have one off the top of my head. 
 Thomas Smith – Standard & Poor’s EQ: Okay. Safe to say that it's considerably more than it was a year or two ago, as far as your Company history goes? 
Mike Sadler : Certainly. Let me share a little bit of data with you here. If you take the number of phones that are manufactured this year, I don’t know whether it is 900 million, closer to 900 million or 1 billion -- from a DRAM content standpoint, probably about 25 megabytes of content per phone. From a NAND flash standpoint about 45 megabytes of content per phone.  From an image sensor standpoint, probably about 70% penetration and the average selling price of a image sensor in a phone this year is probably about $2, between $2 and $3. You can do your own back-of-the-envelope calculations based on those figures, I think. 
 Thomas Smith – Standard & Poor’s EQ: Okay, great. Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Munish Goyal. 
 Munish Goyal - : A couple of questions. It seems like you sound pretty positive about the PC-related DRAM supply/demand equation for the second half of the year. Yet, you are not investing or putting capital. Can you reconcile that for me? Why are you not putting capital for that? 
 Steve Appleton : Munish, it's not a matter of not putting capital. We're putting capital in, we're just not allocating it to produce that particular product. The answer is really pretty simple. Just look at the last seven years, there's only been one or two that have really been okay.  We're allocating the resources to products that we think are more differentiated and have a higher gross margin over a sustainable, longer period of time.  One thing that I think is worth noting is you can't go out and develop an image sensor customer or MCP customer where they have to design this product in months in advance or maybe a year in advance; finally get it to market and call them up and say sorry, we decided to make some PC DRAM instead. It just doesn’t work that way. So we have commitments to make on these products as we build those businesses. As a result, we're going to allocate the resources to do that rather than just short-term change it.  Having said that, it's not that we won't benefit from an improving pricing environment for a product that goes into PCs because as Mike already stated, that's still a big part of our business and we will.  Our focus, as we’ve said now for several years, is to develop a more differentiated product. It's not to exit the PC space, it's to lessen our dependence on it and that's what we're trying to do. 
 Munish Goyal - : So, I guess the follow-up here is if as you said, out of the last seven years, there was one good year for PC-related DRAM, then why even be in this business or have such a large portion of your total business in PC-related DRAM? Why not shrink it to something more substantial? How do you think about that? 
 Steve Appleton : Well, we are shrinking it. As I said, it has continued to shrink for several years now. We're continuing on that path. So the other thing is, you say why make it at all? Well, we do have a lot of capacity in place and we do need scale, we need to continue to be cost competitive in our memory business in totality and that requires that you produce, I think, in all of these spaces.  It's not just as simple as cutting that all off and thinking that it solves all of the problems. It doesn't. You have to go through a transition and the intent and what we've been trying to achieve is go through that transition without damaging the Company in any particular quarter or 12-month period.  We're trying to keep a Company that's growing in the areas we want to grow, continues to make the use of efficiencies that we've learned and developed from the commodity DRAM business and keep that, by the way, knowledge base moving forward by participating in those markets. But leverage that into more differentiated product. 
 Munish Goyal - : I have one more question. This is on capacity. Could you talk about how much of your total wafer starts today are on 65 nanometers? And when you look at 200 millimeter installed capacity, how much of that you will be converting to 65 nanometers to produce DRAM? 
Mike Sadler : Well, first of all, we're not running much of anything on 65 nanometer in production. I don’t think there is hardly anybody else that is either. So, obviously, we're working on the technology, but we haven't deployed it.  Really, when you think about NAND for us, it's likely to be a 50 nanometer node as opposed to a 65 nanometer node. We are doing that, obviously working on that now as we speak as well. In terms of converting from 200 millimeter to 300 millimeter, interesting enough, our model now greatly leverages the 200 millimeter capacity that we've had in place, even though it's a relatively advanced process node. So will a 200 millimeter capacity that we have today, that we are utilizing for more differentiated products, eventually become 65 nanometer? I don't know. Probably, if you continue to make that product base on the 200 millimeter.  The higher probability is that most of your 200 millimeter will eventually convert to 300 millimeter as it becomes less expensive and more applicable to a generation minus one or two or three products portfolio base.  Eventually I think all 200 millimeter will convert for products that we probably make. It just takes quite some time for that to happen, and the leverage, the 200 millimeter that we're actually taking out of the facilities that have been running advance processes for NAND and DRAM.  So I think the probabilities of 200 millimeter becoming 300 millimeter are actually much higher than 200 millimeter moving all the way to 65 nanometer for most of our product base. 
 Munish Goyal - : Thank you so much.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Stover.
Wilbur G. Stover Jr., Principal Accounting Officer and VP of Finance, Chief Financial Officer: Thanks Kipp. Let's start with a discussion of what these financials reflect. That is the results of operations for Micron's historical memory and imaging operations and, beginning January 6th, results of operations for IM Flash's NAND business. These quarterly results for the period ended March 2nd do not yet consolidate TECH Semiconductor's operations. Rather, this is the final quarter in which production from TECH Semi is accounted as a supply arrangement. Neither do they reflect any results of Lexar Media, the pending acquisition which Micron announced March 8th. For our second quarter, net sales totaled $1.23 billion, and the company recorded net income of 193 million or $0.27 per diluted share. The diluted earnings per share calculation is based on 715 million shares. As you are well aware, the company has a long history of investing in research and development. The accomplishments being made in R&D were recognized in part in the second quarter, as operating income reflects the sale of designs and technology to Intel in conjunction with the establishment of IM Flash Technologies. That was for $230 million. As of second quarter end, Micron had cash and investment balances of 2.6 billion. Approximately 500 million of the entries came from Intel as part of formation of IM Flash. Cash provided by operating activities for the six months of 1.3 billion includes 250 million received from Apple as a prepayment for NAND product supply. At quarter end, total debt declined to 461 million. You'll note on review of the balance sheet that receivables increased approximately $120 million over the quarter. And quarter-end total included 171 million from unwind of our call spread option, which was collected the day after quarter end. The benefit of closing out our position was booked as a credit to equity. Our second fiscal quarter is normally a seasonally slower quarter, and that generalization held true for 2006. Average selling prices for PC memory declined noticeably in the first half of the quarter and then increased somewhat resulting in a 12% quarter-over-quarter decline in memory ASPs. The expected seasonal slowing in image sensors did not materialize, as demand for the company's CMOS image sensors remained very strong. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 19%, holding up relatively well despite price pressure in commodity PC DRAMs. Gross margins on CMOS image sensors remained the highest product category for this period. Gross margin on TECH Semiconductor products was slightly higher than the gross margin for similar PC DRAM products and slightly less than the overall gross margin percentage for the period. R&D expense for the second quarter was 160 million. Our partnering efforts are paying off as we continue to have more extensive development across our diversified portfolio, yet are able to hold the absolute dollar of expenditures in check. The quarterly run rate for R&D will likely move up to about 165 million per quarter due to the inclusion of TECH Semi. Selling, general and administrative expenses with the consolidation of IM Flash and TECH Semi will approximate $115 million per quarter for the balance of '06. For the last three years, we have had continued improvement in cash flow provided by operations. The overall improvement reflects our successful diversification efforts. The second quarter's operating cash flow reached 880 million, of which 250 million resulted from the Apple prepayment and 230 million from the sale of designs to Intel. I’ll turn the commentary over to Mike.
Michael Sadler, VP of Worldwide Sales: Thanks Bill. We had a solid quarter of executing to our strategy of pursuing markets that value differentiated semiconductor solutions. Specifically, those markets in addition to desktop and notebook PCs include mobile phones, communications infrastructure equipment, servers and various consumer devices. In those PC markets, we experienced a quarterly decline in ASPs as a result of depressed prices at the beginning of the second quarter. However, we are somewhat pleasantly surprised by an environment in which DRAM demand exceeded supply in the second half of the quarter and this dynamic continues today, defying seasonal expectations. End result being a commodity DRAM prices are up significantly and in good shape as we move through the May quarter. Bottom line, good progress on strategy execution with the bonus of a strong PC DRAM market. There are no surprises on the demand side of the PC market when it comes to DRAM. We are seeing reasonable PC unit growth, continued encroachment of notebook versus desktop systems, steadily expanding memory content for systems and increased penetration of DDR2 in PC platforms. All of this is resulting in a profile of DRAM megabyte demand and technology mix about as expected. We did observe slowing industry wide DRAM megabyte output growth in calendar Q1, and from our perspective, this drove a favorable supply/demand balance. It resulted in commodity DRAM price increases of 60% from the low seen early in the quarter. The environment is generally unchanged since the close of our fiscal Q2, with prices stable and inventories virtually nonexistent. The mobile phone market looks to be on track for another year of healthy unit growth in 2006. Our revenue growth in the mobile phone market is tracking to be a multiple of the overall unit growth rate in this space. This comes from market share gains by Micron, as well as accelerated semiconductor imaging and memory content in mobile platforms. Our mobile phone imaging business achieved modest unit and revenue growth in fiscal Q2 that was mitigated by our supply. We continue to see opportunities for new business in this space and have taken measures to increase imaging capacity that will come to fruition with stronger unit and revenue growth in the current quarter. We got a portfolio of mobile imaging products ranging from VGA through 3-Megapixel in mass production, and are in the early stages of winning designs and ramping production with a 5-Megapixel device. 1-Megapixel and above sensors now represent about one-half of the total imaging business and are on a growth path as new phone designs are moving to mass production and becoming available in the market. Our mobile phone memory business is anchored by the family of low-power DRAM products, including CellularRAM, also referred to as pseudostatic RAM and an offering of mobile DDR and SDRAM products. Our DRAM business in this space continues to migrate up from a density perspective, as the sweet spot in value phones is gradually shifting from 64 megabytes to 128 megabytes of RAM. As the trend of memory density expansion continues, we are intersecting the high end of the market with our own NAND Flash low-power DRAM-based Multichip package devices or MCPs. The first such offering consists of 1 gigabyte of Flash plus an option of either 256 megabytes or 512 megabytes of low-power DRAM. Micron is just one of the few companies capable of integrating our own Flash and DRAM silicon in a memory subsystem, and we believe this offers a compelling advantage as we engage our customers. The consumer electronics markets are driving solid DRAM business for Micron and require a wide variety of memory technologies, chip densities and form factors. This plays into our strength as a manufacturer with a broad DRAM product portfolio. On that note, we're currently manufacturing DRAM chips in densities ranging from 64 megabyte to 2 gigabytes in three different interface technologies, synchronous DRAM, DDR and DDR2. DRAM is leading the way for Micron in consumer markets, and has created a solid on-ramp for our CMOS imaging and NAND Flash products. We have observed some seasonal demand weakness in certain segments of the consumer markets, specifically MP3 players that has resulted in an oversupplied Flash market. Our expectations are that the market demand will recover as we move through the year, the lower Flash prices will result in per-device memory density boost, and the NAND market will have another year of very strong growth in the neighborhood of 200% on a per-bit basis. NAND Flash is a product that requires sales and marketing efforts be directed to consumers as well as OEM customers. Micron plans to expand our presence in the consumer NAND Flash market, and we have multiple options for doing so. We believe that the Crucial brand and online capability and infrastructure combined with Micron's technology, leadership and robust customer relationships offer exciting prospects to achieve this goal. In addition, our proposed acquisition of Lexar will create a strong vertical presence and brand equity position in this market. We believe the combined entity will allow synergies to the benefit of both companies. Our efforts to broaden the product portfolio and balance our exposure to a variety of markets is continuing to progress. While these efforts are evolving, we are quite pleased with the strength of demand in all of the markets that we serve including the PC markets and are quite optimistic about the future. Thanks for your continued interest and support. I will turn it back over to Kipp.
Kipp Bedard, Vice President of Investor Relations: Thanks Mike. What we would like to do now is take questions from callers. And just a reminder, if you are using a speakerphone please pick up the handset when asking the questions so we can hear you more clearly. With that, we would like to open up the lines to questions.
Operator:
Operator Instructions:
Q - Randy Abrams: Yes, good afternoon. I wanted to see if you could give us a snapshot of the ASP change you have for the May quarter, if pricing held firm across your product lines?
A - Michael Sadler: Yeah, on the DRAM side, presumably you are referring to DRAM, actually, I give you both DRAM and Flash. On the DRAM side, if prices were flat, this would be DRAM -- commodity DRAM for PCs, if prices were flat for the balance of the quarter, they would be up in the neighborhood of 20% quarter-over-quarter. In the NAND Flash area, if they were to be flat for the balance of the quarter, they would be down in the neighborhood of 20% to 25% quarter-over-quarter.
Q - Randy Abrams: And if you could talk about the NAND market, looks like there has been some stabilization in the past week, are you starting to see signs of a demand recovery that would suggest a seasonal bottom short-term blip or what do you think is taking place in the market?
A - Michael Sadler: I would share your observation that we’ve seen prices stabilize relatively here in the last week or so. I think it's probably too early to draw a conclusion. It might be a little bit early from a seasonal standpoint for seasonal demand really to be kicking in, but I take it as a positive that prices have stabilized somewhere in that $5 to $6 per 2 gigabyte device range in the last week.
Q - Randy Abrams: Okay, final question. Maybe you can talk about the capital spending. In the press release, you mentioned 2.6 billion, and the prior guidance was 1.9. Is the difference the TECH JV and maybe within that talk about where capital spending has been the past couple of years in TECH JV, if that's what the delta is?
A - Wilbur Stover: The 2.6 billion is the good number is an estimate for fiscal year '06. That has picked up Q3 and Q4 TECH spending, about 200 million for those two quarters. There has also been a little bit of a go forward of spending at the IM Flash effort. So I think it's between 100 million and 200 million that we have go forward into fiscal year '06, and that really was not a dramatic movement but rather just a slide of a couple months there. With regard to the capital spending profile for TECH, we have previously indicated that they do have a migration program to 300 mm; it's probably most significant as opposed to their historical pattern. I would go ahead and give you an indication that fiscal year '07 right now – it’s a little bit of a wide range, but the expectation is that's going to be between 3 billion and 3.5 billion consolidated including TECH, IM Flash and historical Micron operations. And that’s slightly more than 2 billion for IM Flash where you appreciate we have a partner that will be making capital contributions to share in the funding for that and the estimate for TECH in '07 is a little more than 500 million.
Q - Randy Abrams: Okay, thanks a lot for the clarification.
A - Wilbur Stover: Thanks Randy.
Operator: Thank you, our next question is coming from Glen Yeung of Citigroup.
Q - Glen Yeung: Thanks. I think, I forgot who was speaking, was referring to supply/demand imbalance that emerged over the course of the latter part of the quarter, and part of that being driven by a reduced supply curve that you saw over the course of the quarter. I wonder, if we were to look forward into the next, call it two or three quarters, the remainder of the calendar year, what your sense is as to the supply/demand balance for DRAM looking forward.
A - Michael Sadler: It's very difficult for us to predict what the supply/demand balance is going to be; it's so sensitive to a variety of factors. On the demand side, we feel -- on the DRAM side, we feel pretty good about a 50% to 60% annual demand growth in the DRAM area, and that could be accelerated somewhat if prices were to decline but we feel that's a pretty solid figure. And on the NAND Flash side, we feel pretty good about 200% on a per-bit basis growth rate for the year. And your guess is probably better than mine on what's going to happen to the supply side. I would add that we still believe that NAND Flash prices are offering better margins in general for DRAM today, and so the draw, if you will, for flex capacity shifting from Flash to DRAM probably isn't there yet.
Q - Glen Yeung: Would that be true looking forward to your price expectations potentially down 20 or 25 for NAND and up 20 for DRAM?
A - Michael Sadler: My statement refers to the current pricing today, so yes, it does take that into account.
Q - Glen Yeung: So, I guess the obvious question would be, given the pricing that you see, and any mix shift that we will see in the quarter, what should we expect to see for gross margins? And just directionally is fine for the May quarter, particularly as we fold in the TECH JV.
A - Wilbur Stover: Glen as you know, we historically have not guided to gross margins. We can’t tell you to expect again a mid to high single-digit cost reduction profile, and then on the ASP side, we'll let you continue to estimate what you think the rest of the quarter will be.
Q - Glen Yeung: Okay great, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Tim Luke of Lehman Brothers.
Q - Tim Luke: Thank you. I was just wondering if you could clarify what your sense was of, what bit growth would be into the May period in the DRAM arena? Was that mid to high single digit?
A - Wilbur Stover: Yes, it is.
Q - Tim Luke: And could you give us a reminder on the split, DDR/DDR2, and how pricing might look in those two different arenas?
A - Wilbur Stover: I can handle the split. We ran in Q2 about a 50/50 split. We're going to move a little bit more capacity into the DDR2, so maybe it ends up a 55% to 60% split. And maybe, Mike, you would like to address the ASP difference in DDR2 to DDR1?
A - Michael Sadler: Sure. Today, the price that we are realizing for DDR and DDR2 on a per-bit basis is about the same. I would expect that as the PC becomes less of a demand driver for DDR, and it lends itself more towards server applications, that would tend to result in probably a higher selling price per bit. But that's certainly not a guarantee, but that's more than likely what's going to happen.
Q - Tim Luke: I was also wondering with respect to the Flash business, I think you had suggested that the revenue in this February period might have been -- I think your guidance was that it might be flat, with units somewhat higher. Did it end up as around 7%, 8% of the mix or and going forward, should we think about with the lower pricing and limited capacity the revenue being slightly lower? Or you could offer some framework for thinking about how we should think about modeling the back half of the year for NAND?
A - Wilbur Stover: Tim, we're going to stay away from providing any guidance on the revenue side, but maybe I can help you a little bit. The manufacturing arm of IMFT has gone really well. We have seen wafers up 30% Q2 over Q1. We will have another pretty hefty quarter of at least 20% wafer output growth in Q3 over Q2 as well. Again, we're going to stay away from kind of the revenue and bit growth expectations for now.
Q - Tim Luke: Okay, and then another 20% in the following quarter in terms of the units?
A - Wilbur Stover: In terms of wafer output.
Q - Tim Luke: Wafer output, sorry.
A - Wilbur Stover: And as you may know, we're also going through a shrink from 90 into the 70-nanometer node as well.
Q - Tim Luke: Thank you very much.
A - Wilbur Stover: Okay. You bet.
Operator: Thank you, our next question is coming from Joe Osha of Merrill Lynch.
Q - Joseph Osha: Hey folks. Are you able to discuss on sort of a backward-looking basis what the Flash revenues are? Is it just sort of a wafer number that you are willing to give at this point?
A - Kipp Bedard: Well, I think we’ve done that in the past. You saw a revenue percentage of around 6% last quarter, around 8% in fiscal Q2. So I'm referring fiscal Q1 to fiscal Q2. Wafer outs were about 6% last quarter. Again, that will be kind of in that 10% to 12% going into fiscal Q3, pretty good jump in wafer output.
A - Steve Appleton: The other thing Joe worth noting is that we are now splitting that with our partner. So keep in mind that even though there's a cost basis, it comes back to the JV, that half of all of the -- if you think of it as revenue flow now goes through our partner.
Q - Joseph Osha: And I remember Bill, you and I talked about this. As we model the consolidation of the JV, obviously, the margin that you pick up on your external sales from IMFT is subject to whatever pricing assumptions we have but IMFT itself should run at a 0% operating margin, and call it a mid to high single digits gross margin, as we think about how that consolidates? Would that be fair?
A - Wilbur Stover: You've got the overall picture pretty close there, Joe. There's not much margin to the bottom line to the operating income from the sales to our partners or the IM Flash.
Q - Joseph Osha: Right, but the entity has to generate enough gross margins to cover its own operating costs whatever those are. But they are not that high.
A - Wilbur Stover: That's correct.
Q - Joseph Osha: And then, have you guys said when we're going to see NAND output from Dominion?
A - Mark Durcan: Yeah, we have. We will have product qualified, we shipping for revenues this quarter. And then it's basically a second half calendar '06 pretty steep ramp.
Q - Joseph Osha: Okay and then last question, usually and I apologize you may have said this. Did you say that we should expect bit production to be mid to high single digits year end in this quarter?
A - Mark Durcan: That's correct.
Q - Joseph Osha: And that obviously pertains just to DRAM, not to the NAND business, does that wrap in that NAND number there as well?
A - Mark Durcan: That's correct. That was just for DRAM only. We're going to stay away from guiding specifics on the NAND bit growth.
Q - Joseph Osha: But you did give us the wafer, a wafer out number?
A - Mark Durcan: That's correct.
Q - Joseph Osha: Which is what again? I'm sorry.
A - Mark Durcan: It was up 30% fiscal Q2 over Q1, and we'll see another at least 20% growth phase here in fiscal Q3 over Q2.
Q - Joseph Osha: Can you give us a base?
A - Mark Durcan: No. Actually, I can't. I can't, because if you remember what Steve mentioned at the analysts meeting in February, he said basically, we were beginning to process about 7200 wafer outs a week at that time.
Q - Joseph Osha: Out of Boise?
A - Mark Durcan: It has been mostly out of Boise; that's correct. And as I just mentioned, we will get first qualified product out of Virginia this quarter.
Q - Joseph Osha: Understood. Thank you very much.
A - Mark Durcan: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jim Covello of Goldman Sachs.
Q - James Covello: Good afternoon guys, thanks so much. Big picture question. If I'm understanding the release correctly, if you strip out the one-time gain, on an operating basis you're still losing a little bit of money. And this is despite very good restructuring efforts and the pretty healthy end-market environment. And so the question is, what is the pathway to some meaningful profitability? And I guess seasonality has to be considered in all this, but what’s the pathway to meaningful profitability from here?
A - Steven Appleton: Well, two things Jim. First, what we, of course we disclosed, I think the more significant items, which you referenced a gain, there are quite a few things that go on in the quarter that are pluses and minuses and even though cumulatively may add up to something of significance, we don't break them out because individually they are not that significant. I think you should think of -- basically, we thought we would be right about where we were forecasting internally this quarter. We ended up about where we thought. We did have some pluses and minuses besides what you noted. And, having said that, though, there's really few things that really lead us to better profitability. One is to continue the transition and get less dependent on the more commoditized parts, and the other is getting better pricing in the commoditized parts. Both of those will have an impact on us, and again it's mostly forecasted from the research groups. But most of them think that the remainder of this year will be more positive than what we have experienced historically, in particular on the DRAM front.
Q - James Covello: Just quick follow-up question, then on the NAND Flash side. I don't think anybody doubts the 200% bit growth on the demand side. But with everybody increasing CapEx as robustly as they have, if you wind up with 220% supply growth and the pricing in NAND or the margins in NAND wind up being a little bit less attractive than in DRAM, what is your ability to respond to that to create tangible profitability if you will?
A - Steven Appleton: Pretty good, and we've said all along that we would have the ability, the flexibility within the fabs to move back and forth. Obviously, we have a partner on the NAND front with Intel, so it has to be joint discussions with them. But regardless, the flexibility of the fabs that we currently are producing NAND, which primarily are Boise and then, obviously, Virginia we have noted is going to ramp this summer. Both of those -- well, in fact, they both produce DRAM today. So, the flexibility is very good for us.
Q - James Covello: Terrific, final question from me. On the Lexar deal, deal on the surface which seems to make a lot of sense. A lot of the Lexar shareholders are obviously making some noise. Can you give us any perspective about why you think the deal makes sense, and your optimism that the deal can be closed without any further upheavals from the Lexar shareholders? Thank you so much.
A - Steven Appleton: Yeah sure. I don't know if I'll be able to address that last part, because you'll have to talk to Lexar shareholders on that one. But with respect to the reason that we entered discussions to acquire Lexar, there are many of them. Of course, let me just first point out that the Lexar alternative is just one of many alternatives we have of taking our product to the marketplace. There's lots of different channels to do that, and lots of different customers to have that flow through. But having said that, we believe that the combination is good for a number of reasons. First of all, they do have a good team, they demonstrated some good engineering and good capability in the past. And we think we can take a lot of advantage of that. We also think that the potential of combining the two companies will bring a lot of value to the marketplace. When you take really what you think of as the silicon side of it and then you take the form factor side of it, and you put those two together and you optimize them for each other, that there are lot of things that can happen in the new product space that are pretty exciting. Obviously, it's also another channel in addition to the channels that we have in order to take the products to the market. So, we think just in combination, there are lot of good things that can happen and obviously, that's why we did what we did. And in terms of the latter part of your question, we think we’ve offered a fair price. And we’ve done a lot of evaluation, looked at the model, and we think that's a good price. It's going to be up to the Lexar shareholders now to do evaluation as to whether they think it's a fair price. And obviously, I can't speak for them.
Q - James Covello: Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Shawn Webster of JP Morgan.
Q - Samir Barua: Hi, this is Samir Barua for Shawn Webster. I had a few clarifications. You had mentioned about megabyte production, could you clarify what were the megabyte shipments this quarter?
A - Michael Sadler: Well, we don't give an exact number to that but I think we did say the shipments were roughly flat with last quarter, maybe down a percent or so.
Q - Samir Barua: Right. And then in terms of just the inventories, you mentioned about having lean inventories, could you give some more color on what is the inventory composition you have, and what do you expect as inventory trends going into this quarter?
A - Michael Sadler: Sure. Well, we are five weeks into fiscal Q3, and so, we are almost a little over a third of the way through the current quarter. Our inventory levels on virtually all our products are minimal. So, our business model requires us to carry somewhere between or close to two weeks worth of inventory in order to keep our customers running. And that's about where we are, maybe slightly less than that, so not much inventory at all.
Q - Samir Barua: Last question was, if you could clarify your ranking of products by gross margin, is it same as last quarter, or have you seen some movements there?
A - Michael Sadler: Pretty similar. We saw CMOS continue to lead in the highest gross margin and specialty DRAM, NAND and then PC DRAM.
Q - Samir Barua: Great, thank you.
A - Michael Sadler: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Wong of AG Edwards.
Q - David Wong: Thank you very much. Can you give us some idea of how much your shipments -- you said it was roughly flat, bit shipment growth last quarter. Did you sell any stuff out of inventory? Was there any inventory wind-down? Approximately how much was that?
A - Michael Sadler: Yeah, we are, our inventory levels at the end of the quarter were down from where we started the quarter. We started the quarter pretty lean as well. So, I don't remember exactly or I don't have at my fingertips exactly how much we brought them down, but probably a couple days' worth.
Q - David Wong: Right. And on the TECH joint venture, when you consolidate it, does it have anything other than a minimal impact on either your top line or bottom line? Are there any revenues associated with the joint venture that don't actually get sold to Micron?
A - Wilbur Stover: Micron has always had the complete off-take of production from TECH, such that the revenue line does not change at all. The TECH financials have been public, and throughout their history they have made a modest profitability. And when you look at the circumstances, you can anticipate over a reasonable time period, if there's no significant change, that there will not be a significant minority interests pickup. We get rid of the lag pricing relationship in consolidation, but you picked it up accurately -- revenue already fully recognized and no significant other impact.
Q - David Wong: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Krishna Shankar of JMP Securities.
Q - Krishna Shankar: You have given the recent pricing on 2 Gig, you mentioned around $5 to $6 per 2 Gigabyte NAND Flash and 512 Megabyte DRAM being somewhere in the $4.50 to $5 range. Would you still say that NAND Flash on a revenue per wafer basis is more profitable than DRAM? Can you sort of walk us through the cost dynamics of both NAND and DRAM at current levels?
A - Michael Sadler: Yeah. Number one, I'm not going to be able to walk you through our cost structure, certainly. Our assumption is that the industry's cost on a per-bit basis for NAND Flash versus DRAM is probably about 1 to 3. And you can do the math, and that's where we think kind of the profitability crossover would be.
Q - Krishna Shankar: Okay and with MP3 player demand being somewhat soft seasonally, what is your expectation for NAND Flash pricing going into Q2? Are we seeing -- do you expect the stability we have seen in the last couple of weeks to hold, or is this something where we could continue to see downward pressure on NAND Flash pricing?
A - Michael Sadler: Don't know. I mean we could see to, continue to see downward pressure. As I mentioned earlier, we have seen some stability in spot market prices for NAND Flash over the last week, somewhere close to $6. And again, your guess would probably be as good as mine as to what’s going to happen over the next several weeks.
Q - Krishna Shankar: And final question, what are your observations on the push-out of the consumer version of Vista, what that does for DRAM content in PCs in the second half of this year and potential PC demand given the delay in Vista?
A - Michael Sadler: I think on the margin, it results in a more conservative DRAM demand for PCs than otherwise would have been the case. It wasn't fantastic news for us, but our expectations weren’t that Vista was going to result in a huge demand boost in calendar 2006. We still think, by and large, it's a -- we always thought of it as kind of a 2007 product. And sooner it gets in the marketplace, the better for us. But it's not going to save the day.
Q - Krishna Shankar: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Gus Richard of First Albany Corp.
Q - Gus Richard: Yes, could you just walk me through how you're accounting for the startup costs of IMFT as you ramp up the new fabs?
A - Bill Stover: There were some initial, if you will, legal negotiation costs were expensed. But the bulk of the costs are set up as part of the formation of the entity. Honestly, I do not have any significant number in my head, so the answer is that there were not measurable costs to worry about.
Q - Gus Richard: Okay, I was thinking as you ramp up the fab before they have production.
A - Bill Stover: Excuse me. There's nothing different in the IM Flash accounting relative to ramping any other fab. So, the production costs of initial wafers being processed up to the point of qualification, going through an R&D process and once we hit quall, move into inventory.
Q - Gus Richard: Got it, okay and then, if you look at IMFT on a stand-alone basis use, when you combine your sales and the sale to Intel, is that gross margin of the revenue from that above or below corporate average at current pricing?
A - Bill Stover: Well, the gross margin on the NAND Flash product that sells to Intel is very, very thin.
Q - Gus Richard: Exactly. And then, if you -- but that's 49% of the output. 51% of the output you sell in the open market. When you combine those two and just look at it all in, that total gross margin, how does that compare to the corporate? I'm just trying to get a slightly better way of modeling this.
A - Bill Stover: Yeah, I think Mike's already given you an indication of the relative pricing environment and overall cost structure, NAND versus DRAM. We won't be giving any further guidance than that.
Q - Gus Richard: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Adam Parker of Sanford Bernstein.
Q - Adam Parker: Yeah, hi, how would you put the 8% cost per megabyte reduction that you said -- how would you put that in terms of your normal cost reduction? I think you said it would be mid single-digits going forward. I'm just trying to figure out if that's the kind of cost reduction you get long term and year-end these days.
A – Bill Stover: Yeah, I think that has been a pretty good number over the last year, Adam, and probably a solid number to look at going forward over the next four or five quarters.
Q - Adam Parker: So it wasn't -- you weren't pointing it out -- you were just pointing it out as a fact, not as a good or bad thing?
A – Bill Stover: That's right.
Q - Adam Parker: Okay. I know you mentioned that the -- this is second question here in terms of getting rid of the lag pricing relationship with the TECH JV, but you still did get the same discount you always got. Is that right Steve?
A - Steve Appleton: That's correct as far as cash flow.
Q - Adam Parker: So it's just that it's no longer lag; it would just be that when the quarter starts you apply the discount, I'm just trying to figure out how to assume -- take the DRAM, multiply it -- 20, 25% comes from the TECH JV at the same discount you always got, and then the rest is what it is.
A - Steve Appleton: The contractual relationship with TECH Semiconductor doesn't change, such that for purposes of our purchase of product, it remains the 25% lag quarter relationship. So in consolidation, we're picking up revenues, and then you start getting the actual cost profile of TECH as opposed to the discount purchase price relationship. What I was trying to convey earlier was if you look at the long-term history of TECH, it's modestly above breakeven. So when you aggregate the two entities results, the margin that Micron has earned over time on the TECH product is pretty representative of what the consolidated would look like going forward.
Q - Adam Parker: But it should be true over time, the micron DRAM margins or profits are higher than the TECH profits. Is that -- by definition, right?
A - Steve Appleton: If you think of the TECH being breakeven over time, and look at the long-term relationship of the discount pricing that Micron has enjoyed, that’s not that far off of the long-term history of DRAM margin enjoyed by Micron.
Q - Adam Parker: I don't think I understood what you just said. Can you say that – I’m not that smart. Can you say again? So the TECH JV, long-term, has had -- you said profits at about the level of your industry. Is that above or below yours?
A - Steve Appleton: The easiest way to think is that the margins enjoyed by TECH roughly approximate our historical margins.
Q - Adam Parker: How could that be when you are getting it at a discount?
A - Steve Appleton: I don't know how to take you through your host of questions on the conference call. We will be happy to engage with you offline and work the model.
Q - Adam Parker: That's fine. Kipp has explained it to me so many times, I should know it by now anyway. But I still can't figure it out. All right. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Lau of Jefferies & Company.
Q - John Lau: Great, thank you. A lot of questions have been answered, but in terms of recent trends and the big picture, can you walk us through what has happened in terms of the PC demand given the slowdown? And have you seen that impact? And also, have you seen it pick up again? And if so, when? Thank you.
A - Michael Sadler: Hi John, this is Mike speaking. I don't know that we have the best visibility on PC demand, because we are a supplier of components for the PC industry. I'll share with you my observations. We are seeing very strong notebook demand, based on the demand for small outlined end products from us, and that has not really slowed down at all. As a matter of fact, we have got customers screaming at us for more notebook memory today. Server demand has been pretty solid. We are continuing to see more memory density per server, and desktops relatively slow. But all in all, I would say it's about as expected. I don't know how the industry is going to grow this year on a unit basis, probably somewhere close to 10%. And we are seeing pretty healthy three percentage per month content growth, so quite happy with the demand profile.
Q - John Lau: Okay. In terms of what you have been seeing in your end markets, not appreciably different from, then, what you had expected. But maybe you care to characterize that the supply was a little bit tighter than we thought, and you are enjoying a little bit better of a pricing environment as a result of that?
A - Michael Sadler: My belief, our collective belief is that the more moderate supply growth in the first part of the year has resulted in an improved pricing environment. That's correct.
Q - John Lau: Well, thank you. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Hans Mosesmann of Moors & Cabot.
Q - Hans Mosesmann: Thank you. Question on CMOS sensors. What do you expect to get out of the constrained environment that you have there? Will that be in the May quarter?
A - Michael Sadler: You are talking about our supply constraints on image sensors?
Q - Hans Mosesmann: That's right.
A - Michael Sadler: Yeah, it will be, it will be, should be in the August quarter, so in our fiscal Q4, although we are going to have very significant growth in the quarter that we are in right now versus Q2. So, we should be able to lift constraints altogether by our fiscal Q4.
Q - Hans Mosesmann: Okay and what kind of market share do you estimate you have right now? I think you mentioned last time it was around 30% or 30% plus?
A - Michael Sadler: I believe we are still taking market share, so it's probably slightly higher than that. It's very difficult to measure with precision, but somewhere between 30 and 40. Okay.
Q - Hans Mosesmann: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you, our next question is coming from Lilian Li of Kraft Investment (phonetic). Lilian your line is alive. Our next question is coming from Alex Gauna of UBS.
Q - Alex Gauna: Yes thank you. You mentioned that if NAND conditions hold that you would be down perhaps some 20, 25% quarter-on-quarter for the May timeframe. Did you see a similar decline this current quarter, so that we are really talking about for the first half of the year is some 40 to 50% decline? And is that within your expectations?
A - Michael Sadler: Can you repeat that? I just want to make sure I got the question right. Could you repeat the question?
Q - Alex Gauna: I'm wondering, combining – when you gave some – I listened earlier, and you mentioned NAND pricing falling some 20 to 25%. If they hold now, for the May time frame, would be your expectation, and did you see a similar sort of decline for the February time frame? What was the ASP dynamic there? And is that consistent with the first-half pricing environment of being off some 40 to 50%? And is that within your expectations?
A - Michael Sadler: Yes. I'd say that's an accurate statement. I mean ballpark, NAND prices are down roughly 50% since the beginning of the calendar year, and if they stabilize from this -- anyway, they are down roughly 50% from the beginning of the calendar year.
Q - Alex Gauna: And you mentioned MP3s being one area of softness. Are there any areas that are under particular pressure right now? Are there any ways for you to find relief within certain card formats? What’s your mix dynamic like on that front?
A - Michael Sadler: It is heavily weighted towards embedded consumer products like MP3 players, our mix today is. And as we are growing output through the IMFT joint venture, we're starting to enable some other markets like a variety of – participating with players who get us into a variety of card form factors and various other end products. But to date, we have been largely dependent upon embedded applications, specifically MP3 players.
Q - Alex Gauna: Okay. And are you able to progress in terms of while you are involved with the Lexar negotiations, to develop some of these new relationships? Is that being impeded all by the talks right now?
A - Michael Sadler: No, no. The Lexar negotiations or the intended acquisition of Lexar is really independent of our ability to develop new customers and new markets for our products.
Q - Alex Gauna: And last one if I could. The development of your MLC technology -- how is that progressing? What are your expectations there?
A - Michael Sadler: We're moving ahead well. The 90-nanometer is now -- MLC is now an internal quall. We anticipate qualifying that sometime this summer. We have silicon on our 72-nanometer MLC, and that’s looking pretty solid too. So we'd anticipate having samples out on that later this year, and in full flow development on 50-nanometer MLC.
Q - Alex Gauna: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Bill Dezellem of Titan Capital Management.
Q - Bill Dezellem: Thank you. We have a group of questions. First of all, relative to the Vista operating system delay, there were rumblings in the industry that there were going to be Vista-compatible systems out sometime in the spring, or required by Microsoft to be out in that timeframe. Does this impact the timing of that at all, given that it was only a couple of months movement in the actual shipment date? What's your view on that?
A - Michael Sadler: I believe that it does, and I think the PC guys are probably breathing a big sigh of relief on that, because they were not too keen about loading a lot more memory into their systems in the face of rising DRAM prices. So yeah, I believe it does probably result in a push out of that by a quarter or two or something like that, Bill. It's probably worth mentioning that…
Q - Bill Dezellem: At this point, when would you anticipate PC makers to start shipping the Vista-compatible systems?
A - Michael Sadler: I don't know. I don't know. I really don't know. I mean, I didn't comb through the Microsoft announcement in any detail, as far as when they were going to release the operating system. But our customers, the PC makers were telling us that they were going to be maybe a quarter or so ahead of the release with the Vista-compliant systems from a hardware standpoint. So, I would imagine that's probably still going to hold. It's worth mentioning that we, all along, have thought the effective impact of Vista was going to be a lifting of the minimum configuration from a memory content standpoint to 1 gigabyte. We're on our way there, anyway. We're at somewhere between 700 megabyte and 800 megabyte per system today, growing 3% per month or something along those lines. So, we are headed there anyway; it's just, it is a delay of a quarter or two.
Q - Bill Dezellem: That's helpful. And then, relative to shift from DRAM to Flash NAND in the industry, what update do you have in terms of the magnitude that continues to take place? Or is it a perception of you all that has stabilized now?
A - Kipp Bedard: Bill, if you look at the public reports from other companies, they basically would say they’ve flattened out any kind of a conversion from DRAM to NAND. So now you can look at NAND growth and DRAM growth based more on the CapEx that they’ve guided to.
Q - Bill Dezellem: And from everything you’ve seen, the public reports are reasonably reliable?
A - Kipp Bedard: That's a whole different answer, whole different question, I guess, to that one.
Q - Bill Dezellem: Well I will shift off to that then. Image sensors, very quickly, a couple of questions. What percent of the outs do they represent? I apologize if I missed it. And then secondarily, would you please update relative to the opportunities that you see for the non-mobile phone markets for image sensors?
A - Kipp Bedard: Mike, do you want to start with that one? And then I'll follow up with the production piece.
A - Michael Sadler: Sure. From today's revenue standpoint Bill, the most significant non-mobile phone piece for image sensors would be computer products. So, either accessory cameras to computers or embedded cameras to computers. We’ve talked publicly about some big design wins that we've had in the past, particularly in the notebook area, where we continue to make progress there. It's a meaningful portion of our imaging business today. Beyond that, we've got some business in the medical field as well, which is, I would say, it's also a meaningful percentage of our imaging business today, and we expect that's going to be growing pretty significantly as we move forward. We’ve got a whole slew of designs in the automotive area which are probably not going to come to fruition from a revenue generation standpoint until -- meaningfully, anyway, until late '07/'08 timeframe. And security is another area that we're starting to secure some design wins and should start to generate some revenue there within a year or so.
A - Kipp Bedard: Bill on the image sensor side, we saw wafers up in the mid-teens level, which put it at about that level for total wafer outs compared to total micron wafer outs. In fiscal Q3 over Q2, we're looking at probably a little more than 20% wafer growth dedicated to image sensors.
Q - Bill Dezellem: Great, thank you both.
A - Michael Sadler: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ben Lynch of Deutsche Bank.
Q - Ben Lynch: Yeah, hi guys, a couple of questions probably not as many, to allow speaker. It looks like gross margins were down around 250 basis points, Q on Q. Pretty simplistically, that is sort of in line with what you spoke about as the delta between DRAM ASPs being down about 12% and costs down about 8%. But it looks like you had a couple of positive things, deals that would have helped you -- TECH Semi costs would have been down, I guess, in line with the ASP drop in the prior quarter, so 15% or so. And CMOS image sensors, you haven't given specific numbers there, but you were talking about it quite positively. So, I am assuming it grew within the overall mix. I'm just wondering why we didn't see sort of just a better performance of gross margins. Is it maybe the increased sale of NAND products to Intel, or is there something I'm missing in the mixed space?
A - Kipp Bedard: Yeah, that’s part of it Ben. We did start sharing half the output basically with our partners there for half the quarter, so that didn’t impact gross margins. And TECH Semi, just to be clarified, actually contributed lower gross margin percentage than it did last quarter. Keep in mind, in fiscal Q2, we still were under the quarter lag, and prices were down Q2 over Q1. So basically, those two impacted us on a more negative standpoint. Image sensors have a…
Q - Ben Lynch: Your TECH Semi costs will have been down faster than your internal DRAM costs. So, the relative gross margin would have improved for TECH Semi.
A - Kipp Bedard: No, you're…
Q - Ben Lynch: Internal costs were down 8%, and your TECH Semi costs would have been down 15%, which is the ASP drop in the prior quarter.
A - Kipp Bedard: No, you still saw a more significant price decline in fiscal Q2 than what we averaged buying product from TECH at in fiscal Q1. That's the relative comparison you need to make.
Q - Ben Lynch: Okay, I still don't get that but I'll maybe get you offline. This is for Mike. When you spoke about, if you hold NAND ASPs where they are now, they would still be down 20% to 25%, is that for Micron's February to May, or from March to June?
A - Michael Sadler: That is for our fiscal quarter, so the…
Q - Ben Lynch: So, yes, February to May?
A - Michael Sadler: May quarter.
Q - Ben Lynch: My understanding is the steepest contract price declines are actually in March, so the June to March comparison would be even worse. Is that right?
A - Michael Sadler: I believe the prices declined more severely in March than any other period. That's correct.
Q - Ben Lynch: Okay, very good, and then just --
A - Kipp Bedard: And, Ben, I would like to just clarify that. That was just relative to NAND Flash. I didn't catch that in your question, but this is long, as everybody on the call…
Q - Ben Lynch: Yeah, thank you. And the last question I had Bill, at the analysts day -- and maybe I just took bad notes, but I had understood that you said for SG&A to model 100 million going forward as some costs sort of go away. Now, this quarter, you said 115 million for the rest of the year. Did I just take bad notes, or has been maybe some change or…?
A - Bill Stover: I don't remember my notes that time Ben. There has been an increase in our internal estimate. So, I do believe it's a byproduct of increased or most recent estimates reflective of both TECH and IM Flash. So, 115 looks like pretty solid guidance.
Q - Ben Lynch: Right, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Shailesh Jaitly of Nomura Securities.
Q - Shailesh Jaitly: Yeah, hi thanks for taking my question. If you could just help me understand the cost reduction dynamics in the NAND segment, what proportion of your output in NAND is 70-nanometer now, and where do you expect it by end of the year? And if you could also help me walk through the MLC ramp in the same time frame, thanks?
A - Michael Sadler: Sure. We haven’t given specific guidance for 70, but 90 and below is roughly 30% of all of our advanced products. So, it's a pretty good conversion happening there. As Mark mentioned, we're qualified on 72 coming out of Boise today, and we're looking on it on SLC and we’re looking at qualifying on the 72 range in MLC in the second half of the year.
Q - Shailesh Jaitly:
voice overlapping:
A - Michael Sadler: That is correct.
Q - Shailesh Jaitly: Okay, thank you.
A - Michael Sadler: Welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Richard Prati of American Technology.
Q - Richard Prati: Hi guys. Could you please tell us where you are right now as a percentage of output by product today, and where you would expect that to be, say, 6 to 12 months from now?
A - Kipp Bedard: Sure. I think Steve did a pretty good job of outlining that at our analysts meeting in February, Richard. We’ve been running around 50% of our revenues coming from PC DRAM. Obviously, that's starting to move down. We have not as many wafers aimed at PC DRAM as we go forward here. So, I'm trying to give you a little bit of a feel for two things, one, the wafer allocation; and two, we're going to have to estimate the revenue impact based on what you think ASPs are going to do. But we're going to see, as a percentage, fewer PC DRAM heading down into that 40 range. We're going to see image sensors around 20% range. We had guided NAND Flash to be in the 17% to 20% range and the balance to be in specialty DRAM, in the fourth calendar quarter of '06.
Q - Richard Prati: Okay, thanks a lot.
A - Kipp Bedard: Yeah, you bet. And with that, we would like to thank everyone for participating on the call. If you will please bear with me, I need to repeat the Safe Harbor protection language.

With that I’d like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Stover.
Wilbur G. Stover: Thanks Kipp.  For our first quarter, net sales totaled $1.36 billion, and the company recorded net income of 63 million or $0.09 per diluted share.  The diluted earnings per share calculation is based on 707 million shares, that’s inclusive of 54 million shares underlying our convertible debt.  It should be evident from this level of net income that our diversification efforts are progressing meaningfully.  These financials do not include any results of IM Flash Technologies, our joint venture with Intel which will begin operations in January. Let me take a few moments to talk about how IM Flash Technologies will impact our financials.  First, our joined analysis with Intel confirmed that the venture will appropriately be consolidated in Micron’s financials.  Beginning in the few weeks, our results will reflect consolidation of the joint ventures manufactures NAND flash memory.  Remembering that both Micron and Intel will take approximately half of the output, the net sales line will pickup the NAND production sold to Intel at manufacturing cost, and the net sales line will pickup the other half of the production as it is sold by market, by Micron at market prices. Cost-to-goods sold will reflect the cost manufacturing NAND devices.  The partnering with Intel recognize as a significant value in the investments Micron has been making in research and development.  Fundamentals of the partnership is a sale of process technology designed and know how for in excess of $200 million.  The technology sale is expected to be recognized as again reflected in other operating income.  On an ongoing basis, our consolidated research and development expenditures will be reduced by approximately $25 million per quarter, as a result of the cost sharing with Intel.  The sale of technology to Intel and the anticipated $250 million prepaid from Apple will boost through our consolidated cash and investments position by approximately $500 million in January. With formation of the venture, Micron’s consolidated capital expenditures will rise to approximately 2 billion.  Approximately $500 million increase for fiscal year ’06 over the number, which we’ve previously communicated.  Overall, net sales were up 8% over the immediately preceding quarter.  Gross margin, for the quarter came in at 23%.  The slight increase in gross margin percentage is quite impressive actually giving a price pressure and commodity PC DRAMs and as a testament to the benefits being derived from our diversification efforts.  Gross margin on tech semiconductor products was slightly higher than the overall reported gross margin for the first quarter. Research and development expense for the first quarter was $166 million, slightly higher than the fiscal 2005 run rate.  A benefit of our partnering in NAND flash will be the sharing of certain R&D cost.  We expect the run rate for consolidate R&D expense to reduce by approximately $100 million per year through our partnering arrangement.  As always future R&D expenses will vary significantly with a number of wafers, dedicated new device development and qualification. Selling, general and administrative expenses stayed in the $85 million to $90 million band through fiscal 2005.  We expect the quarter run rate in 2006 with a consolidation of IM Flash Technologies to be between 95 million and 100 million. For the last three years, we’ve had continued improvement in cash flow provided by operation.  The overall improvement reflects our successful diversification into specialty DRAM and CMOS image sensors.  The first quarters operating cash flow reached in excess of 425 million, in part benefiting from successful reductions in inventory levels, our finished goods inventory decreased by 22% quarter-over-quarter.  As of first quarter end, Micron had cash investments balances approximating $1.4 billon.  Total debt declined to 1.1 billion and call protection on our $632 million convertible notes expires on February 2006.  The notes due in 2010 are convertible into common stock at conversion price of $11.79 per share. One other item, this quarter is the first period reflecting stock option expense under statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123(NYSE:R).  The total period expense was $3.8 million.  With that, I’ll turn the commentary over to Mike.
Michael W. Sadler: Thanks Bill.  We continued to be pleased with the robust demand environment in the mobile communications, consumer electronics and computing markets.  These markets account for the vast majority of demand from Micron Semiconductor-Memory and imaging products.  As evidence, by the quarter-over-quarter, 11% megabit sales increase and corresponding finished goods inventory reduction as referenced by Bill.  The markets are healthy and easily absorbing the output from our production facilities. Micron remains focused on achieving an optimal balance of business in the key end markets.  We’ve had another quarter of solid execution towards achievements of that objective.  While we have significant revenue exposure in the world’s largest market for semiconductors, computers we believe that more rapid growth in communications consumer and industrial markets will drive more value. With this in mind, we continue to add to a product portfolio that strengthens Micron’s value proposition to customers in all of these market segments.  While that computer market demand is solid from both unit growth and memory content standpoints, the industry has grown DRAM supplies such that price pressure on commodity chips used by notebook and desktop PCs has intensified during the quarter.  Micron is not immune to this price pressure.  We believe however, that supply and demand will ultimately find a balance.  We expect that our ability to reduce cost to yield improvement and technology advancement will track market price decline. Well, we are not expanding share in the notebook, desktop area.  These segments are and will continue to be significant demand drive principle for the industry and for Micron.  In the computing arena, we are focused on being early to market with high density chips and modules.  Good execution is driving more segment share and workstation in server applications.  Our 1 gigabit and 2 gigabit DDR and DDR2 components and the 2, 4 and 8 gigabyte modules that they enable are current examples of solutions that create value for Micron and our customers.  The competitive playing field in the high reliability, high density memory area is not fully dependent on selling price per bit.  With a focus on timed market and technical collaboration, we are able to create more high-end computing business from Micron DRAMs.  This shield us somewhat from the severe price competition that results from an over supply commodity DRAM market. Mobile phone terminals are among the most exciting applications from Micron and we now have four product categories targeting this space including image sensors, CellularRAM, mobile DRAM and both embedded and external NAND flash.  To put it simply the market here is growing, we are growing share with existing products and we are introducing new products that are capturing new design wins for us. Memory content in mobile phones expanding more rapidly than in, any other high-volume electronic product, NAND flash, CellularRAM and low power DRAM products play a critical role in the memory sub system.  The sweet-spot memory solution in a high end phone today, is a multi-chip packaged product, built with 256 megabit NOR chip plus the 64 megabit CellularRAM.  This is slowly transitioning to 512 Meg NOR plus 128 CellularRAM or lower power DRAM.  As we move through 2006, we believe the market will begin to shift to MTPs that was 1 gigabit NAND chips and 256 megabit or 512 megabit low power DRAMs.  We currently play a key role in the mobile phone market with our family of CellularRAM and low power DRAM products.  Our hope is that this becomes a commanding role with both the NAND and DRAM pieces in play. Our recently announced NAND flash manufacturing venture with Intel will help us achieve scale and improves time-to-market with NAND devices for the cell phone market.  With our product line up, technology and infrastructure we couldn’t be more pleased with our position in the cell phone memory eco system.  I think by now, you are aware of Micron’s position, to top the CMOS Image Sensor market.  While, camera penetration rates are approaching 60% worldwide, we are continuing to outgrow the market and had now even captured multiple design wins, in the Japanese market, the last frontier for CCD sensors.  We are introducing cost-reduced versions of VGA and 1-Megapixel sensors as well as new 2 and 3-Megapixel sensors for high resolutions mobile phone cameras. Our current mix of revenues in the camera phone space is approximately 1.5 VGA and 1.5, 1-Megapixel and above.  The VGA sensors are having a longer and well-anticipated life, as camera penetration reaches the low end and many phones now even feature dual cameras.  We were expecting that market demand for our sensors might temper somewhat seasonally but this is proving not to be the case.  We are moving some memory production within the Micron’s fab networks to create even more and near-term imaging capacity to seize the market opportunity. Camera-enabled mobile phones have been a primary driver of revenues for CMOS Imagers and this will continue to be the case as we move forward.  While not the most significant revenue generators today, we are devoting a number of product development and field resources to other promising markets in the imaging area.  Some examples would be consumer items like digital still cameras, PC cameras and medical and automotive applications.  Each of these product areas is of interest not only from the imaging perspective, as we also the have capability of providing application-specific memory devices into these markets for a common customer and application base. Our strategy of developing a diverse set of some semiconductor-memory and imaging products; it’s clearly paying financial dividends.  From our perspective, the real value is coming from strengthening and broadening customer relationships, these relationships have created a solid foundation from which to build upon.  Thanks for your continued interest and support in the company and I’ll turn it back to Kipp.
